<p class='c005'>In presenting the <span class='sc'>Field Book</span> to the Sporting World, some
explanation respecting the motives that led to its publication, are
deemed necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>An enthusiastic admirer of rural sports from boyhood, the
Compiler sought with avidity after any book connected with his
favourite recreations, from which either amusement or information
might be obtained. The older authors, with the exception of a few
pages of quaint and curious anecdote, were generally formed of
barbarous theories, whose absurdities had long since caused them to
be disregarded. The more modern, whether confined to a particular
subject, or professing to be repertories of British Sports, were too
frequently overloaded with hackneyed and unimportant matter, and
merely reprints of treatises for years before the public, and differing
from their predecessors in nothing but the name.</p>

<p class='c006'>But had there been nothing objectionable in the execution of
sporting works, as they appeared during the last century, the total
change in everything connected with the British field, would render
them now of little value, but to point a contrast between the
past and present systems. Without reverting to the times when
jockeys rode in tie-wigs, and men would not venture to a trout-stream
unless furnished with a velvet cap; when country gentlemen
deserted their ladye-loves ere cock-crow, to see the sun rise above a
fox-cover; when no pond-fish could resist a bait prepared with a
dead-man’s finger; and a sucking-mastiff, stuffed with snails and
judiciously roasted, was a sovereign remedy for a shoulder-slip;—without
reverting to these times, what changes have not occurred
within our own recollections? The mystic arcana of old professors
have vanished before practical and scientific improvement, and the
Sporting World has undergone a total revolution, and produced a
new order of men and things.</p>

<p class='c006'>While, however, expressing these convictions, the Compiler would
not undervalue many of the useful and intelligent writers and collectors
who have preceded him. With allowances for their times,
and the false theories then received, which modern science has exploded,
where will more information be found than in the “Rural
Sports,” “Thoughts on Hunting,” “Essay on Sporting,” and other
contemporaneous works? It is of the copyists of these writers that
the Compiler would complain, who, adopting everything, good and
bad, from these originals, without a single addition of their own, have
dosed the public ad nauseam, re-vending the same wares again and
again, without even the redeeming grace of acknowledging the
sources of their spoliations.</p>

<p class='c006'>To produce a short and lucid compendium of all matters connected
with the field, and which might be considered interesting to the sportsman,
has been the object of the present compilation. All that
appeared valuable in the old school, as far as was compatible with the
progress of modern science, has been retained; while in established
improvements, the more recent systems have only been attended to.
Where, however, ancient and modern principles were opposed, and
the point at issue was doubtful or consequential, authorities in support
of the conflicting theories are quoted, and the reader can use a
discretionary power in his adoption.</p>

<p class='c006'>To convey simple information and avoid scientific display, has
been the Compiler’s wish; and the plainest of the received authorities
have accordingly been preferred. Hence, White of Exeter,
and Bewick, have been principally followed in the veterinary
and ornithological departments; while the more erudite pages of
Blaine and Percivall, Cuvier, Montagu, and Rennie, have contributed
much that was valuable. In canine descriptions and diseases,
Brown and Blaine have been selected. On piscatory subjects
Daniel forms the text-book, while Davy and modern <i>artistes</i> of the
angle have not been overlooked. In sporting antiquities the Compiler
has consulted Strutt; in falconry he has chosen Sebright.
Upon the breeding and management of game, Moubray has been his
Mentor. From Jesse and White of Selborne much that was curious
in natural history and animal economy has been extracted. In the
mechanical department he has received assistance from several leading
gun-makers; and upon numerous subjects of general interest
to the sportsman, in Colonel Hawker he acknowledges a <i>Magnus
Apollo</i>. Finally, many anonymous works and writers, either not
essentially sporting or of minor name, have been extensively quoted
in the pages of the <span class='sc'>Field Book</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having stated the principal sources from whence the compilation
has been made, it may be observed that as it was an object to embrace
British sports generally, considerable difficulty arose in compressing
a necessary portion of information upon these varied pursuits,
within the small compass of a single octavo. A second volume,
or one of larger size, was objectionable; and although the smallest
sized type consistent with comfort to the reader has been employed,
it is feared that many a sin of omission will be laid at the Compiler’s
door. From the difficulty attendant on alphabetic arrangement,
some articles also were omitted in their proper place, and must be
sought for in the Appendix. All the compiler can say in apology is,
that when the Field Book is found summary or imperfect, the necessity
of compression must be recollected, and a reference to a
competent authority will enable the reader to find all that he
requires. The Compiler would here remark, that the books and
authors mentioned above, will be found of infinite service in their
respective departments; and many of them are indispensably necessary
to him who would possess a well-appointed stable and a
healthy kennel.</p>

<p class='c006'>One subject introduced into the pages of the Field Book, might
to some appear anomalous. Yacht-sailing has been slightly noticed;
and had the limits of the work permitted, it should have
held the prominent place to which it is so well entitled. While
hill or forest bounds the sporting adventurers of other lands, the
“deep, deep sea” is made subservient to the pastimes of Great
Britain; and the flag, which in war bore “the battle and the breeze,”
in peace sweeps over the blue wave which owns its power, and
would almost prove that the elements themselves cannot bound the
sportive enterprise of the true-born Briton.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Wounds of the Abdomen, or Belly</i>,
may occur to horses in leaping hedges, or
pales, or be inflicted by the horns of a
cow. Sometimes the tendinous covering of
the belly is ruptured, while the skin remains
entire; the gut then protrudes and forces
out the skin into a tumour. This is a
rupture of the belly, and is thought incurable.
I have known one very large rupture
cured by cutting out a piece of the skin
which covered it, and then sewing up the
wound and supporting it with a bandage. In
some accidents the skin also is divided, with
its peritonæal covering; the gut then comes
out, and the wound is of a very dangerous
nature, and still more so if the gut itself is
wounded. The first thing to be done is to
put the gut back, taking care to remove any
dirt or other matter that may be sticking to
it; for which purpose, should it be found
necessary, it may be washed with warm
water. If the gut cannot be returned, from
its being full of air, the opening in the belly
may be carefully enlarged to the necessary
size. After the gut is returned, the skin
<i>only</i> should be stitched up; and a cushion of
several folds of old linen and tow being placed
on the wound, should be kept in its situation
by means of a wide bandage rolled round the
body, and carefully secured. The animal
should then be copiously bled, have his bowels
emptied by clysters, and his food restricted to
grass or bran mashes, and that in moderate
quantity.</p>

acetous acid, and remains in the liquor.</p>

<p class='c006'>This mordant gives a richer colour than alum.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lime is also sometimes employed as a mordant,

put in a bath of sulphate of indigo, diluted
according to the strength of shade required,

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Adder</span>, <i>s.</i> A serpent, a viper, a poisonous reptile.</p>

<p class='c006'>Adders or vipers are found in many parts
of Europe; but the dry, stony, and in particular
the chalky countries abound with them.
These animals seldom grow to a greater length
than two feet; though sometimes they are
found above three. The ground colour of their
bellies is a dirty yellow; that of the female
is deeper. The whole length of the back is
marked with a series of rhomboid black spots,
touching each other at the points; the sides
with triangular ones; the belly entirely black.
It is chiefly distinguished from the common
ringed snake by the colour, which in the latter
is more beautifully mottled, as well as by the
head, which is thicker than the body; but
particularly by the tail, which, in the viper,
though it ends in a point, does not run tapering
off to so great a length as in the other.
When, therefore, other distinctions fail, the
difference of the tail can be discerned at a
single glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The adder differs from most other serpents
in being much slower, as also in excluding its
young completely formed, and bringing them
forth alive. The kindness of Providence
seems to be exerted not only in diminishing
the speed, but also the fertility, of this dangerous
creature.</p>

<p class='c006'>The adder is capable of supporting very
long abstinence, it being a well ascertained
fact that some have been kept in a box six
months without food; yet during the whole
time their vivacity was not abated. They
feed only a small part of the year, but never
during their confinement; for if mice, their
favourite diet, should at that time be thrown
into their box, though they will kill, yet they
will never eat them. When at liberty they
remain torpid throughout the winter; yet,
when confined, they have never been observed
to take their annual repose.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are usually taken with wooden tongs,
by the end of the tail, which may be done
without danger; for, while held in that position,
they are unable to wind themselves up
to hurt their enemy; yet, notwithstanding
this precaution, the viper-catchers are often
bitten by them; but, by the application of
olive oil, the effect is safely obviated.</p>

<p class='c006'>William Oliver, a viper-catcher, at Bath,
was the first who discovered this admirable
remedy. On the first of June, 1735, in the
presence of a great number of persons, he
suffered himself to be bit by an old black
viper, brought by one of the company, upon
the wrist, and joint of the thumb of the right
hand, so that drops of blood came out of the
wounds. Being willing to satisfy the company
thoroughly, and trusting to the speedy
effects of his remedy, which was nothing more
than olive oil, he forbore to apply anything
till he found himself exceedingly ill, and
quite giddy; in about an hour and a quarter
after the first of his being bit, a chafing dish
of glowing charcoal was brought in, and his
naked arm was held over it as near as he
could bear, while his wife rubbed in the oil
with her hand, turning his arm continually
round, as if she would have roasted it over
the coals; he said the poison soon abated, but
the swelling did not diminish much. Most
violent purgings and vomitings soon ensued;
and his pulse became so low and so often
interrupted, that it was thought proper to
order him a repetition of cordial potions; he
said he was not sensible of any great relief
from these; but that a glass or two of olive
oil, drank down, seemed to give him ease.
Continuing in this dangerous condition, he
was put to bed, where his arm was again
bathed over a pan of charcoal, and rubbed
with olive oil, heated in a ladle over the charcoal.
From this last operation he declared
that he found immediate ease, as though by
some charm: he soon after fell into a profound
sleep, and, after about nine hours’ sound
rest, awaked about six the next morning, and
found himself very well.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In every quarter of the globe but Europe,
dogs are exposed to the venomous attacks of
snakes, whose bite is instantly mortal. The
viper is the only animal of this kind in Britain
capable of inflicting a wound attended with
serious consequences, and to which dogs become
exposed when hunting. In these cases,
the bitten part swells enormously, and the
animal expresses great distress and suffering:
at length he becomes affected with torpor, or,
in some cases, with convulsions, when death
commonly ensues. But it is not often that
these bites are fatal, particularly when proper
means are resorted to for obviating the
effects. These means consist in freely rubbing
the bitten part with volatile alkali, or with
the spirit of hartshorn mixed with oil; giving
also seven, ten, or twelve drops of the volatile
alkali, or otherwise forty drops to a large dog,
of the spirit of hartshorn, in a teaspoonful or
two of sweet oil, every hour, until the amendment
is evident.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Aërie</span>, <i>s.</i> A nest of hawks, or other birds of prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following account of the robbery of an
aërie is given by Mr. Bullock:—“On the
10th of June, 1812, they were seen in their
aërie on the tremendous cliff called the West
Craigs, in the Isle of Hoy, (one of the Orkneys,)
the towering rocks of which rise to the
perpendicular height of 1200 feet from the
sea. About one third of the way down this
awful abyss, a slender pointed rock projected
from the cliff, like the pinnacle of a Gothic
building: on the extremity of this is a hollow
scarcely of a sufficient size for the purpose
for which these birds had fixed on it, <i>i. e.</i>, a
place of security for rearing their young; the
situation was such as almost to defy the power
of man to molest their habitation; yet, with
the assistance of a short slender rope, made
of twisted hogs’ bristles, did the well-known
adventurous climber, or rocksman, ‘Woolly
Tomson,’ traverse the face of this frightful
precipice, and, for a trifling remuneration,
brought up the young birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After a fatiguing scramble up the sides of
the mountain, we arrived at the place from
whence we could see the aërie beneath; the
distance was so great that the young eagles
appeared no larger than pigeons. After placing
us in a secure situation on a projecting
ledge of the rock, Tomson left us, carrying
his rope in his hand, and disappeared for
upwards of half an hour; when, to our great
joy, we discovered him creeping on his hands
and knees up the spiry fragment, on which
lay the unfledged eaglets; when, knowing he
was then in our sight, he knelt on the top,
and looking towards us, waved his hat. At
this time it was impossible to see the situation
he was in without trembling for his safety;
the slender point of the rock on which he
knelt was at least 800 feet above the surges
of the Atlantic, which, with unbroken violence,
were foaming beneath him. Yet he
deliberately took from his pocket a cord, and
tying the wings of the young birds, who made
some resistance with their bills and talons, he
put them into a basket, and began to descend,
and in a few minutes the overhanging masses
of stone hid him from our view. The old
birds were in sight during the transaction, and
made no attempt to defend, but, soaring a
quarter of a mile above, occasionally uttered a
short shrill scream, very different from their
usual barking noise. Had they attempted a
rescue, the situation of the climber would
have been extremely dangerous, as the slightest
deviation or false step would have precipitated
him into eternity, a misfortune that a
few years since befel his brother on the same
spot, when in his company.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After waiting in a most painful state of
suspense for near an hour, our climber suddenly
made his appearance, and, laughing,
presented his prize.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Age of a Horse.</i>—The age of a horse
may be discovered by certain marks in the
front teeth of the under jaw until he is eight
years old, about which period they are generally
worn out. An experienced person can,
however, judge of a horse’s age pretty nearly
by the countenance and general appearance of
the animal, as well as by the length of the
teeth and form of the tushes. Between the
second and third year a colt begins to change
his sucking or colt’s teeth, as they are termed,
for permanent teeth, which are larger, and of
a different form and colour. The sucking
teeth are small, and of a delicate white colour.
When a colt is three years old, or between
the second and third year, he changes his
two front teeth, above and below; between
the third and fourth year the two next are
changed; and between the fourth and fifth
year the two next, or corner teeth, are
changed. About the end of the fourth year,
or a little later, the tushes appear. Mares
have seldom any tushes. At five years old
the horse has a full mouth of permanent or
horse teeth, and the corner teeth are those by
which the age is ascertained after that period:
they have a remarkable hollow or shell-like
appearance when they first come up; but by
the time the horse has completed his fifth
year they have acquired some size, and look
more like the other teeth. There is a cavity
on their upper surface, at this period, of a
dark or blackish colour. At six years old the
cavity is much diminished, and at seven it is
still less; at eight it has entirely disappeared,
or if any mark remain, it resembles rather the
eye of a bean. The tushes at five years old
have two concavities withinside them, converging
upwards, and terminating in the point
of the tooth: at six, one of these concavities
is lost; that is, the one next the grinder: at
seven, the other is diminished, but not quite
gone: at eight, it is generally gone, but not
always: afterwards the tush gradually gets
more round and blunt. These are the changes
by which the horse’s age is usually determined;
but they are subject to variations,
and the only certain method of ascertaining
the age, after six, is by a reference to the
breeder. The length of the teeth is no criterion
whatever; nor can the countenance
be depended upon until the horse becomes
very old and grey. The marks in the upper
teeth have been thought to indicate the age:
the marks in the two front teeth disappearing
at eight, in the two next at ten, and in the
corner teeth at twelve.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The general signs of age, unconnected with
the animal’s teeth, are easily distinguishable.
The head grows lean and fine; the features
look more striking; the hollows over the eyes
deeper; the eyes themselves grow irritable,
and twinkle; the cheeks become lank; the
gums and soft palate pale and shrunk; the
sub-maxillary space is capacious; and grey
hairs make their appearance in various places,
more particularly over the eyes and about the
face. In regard to the body generally, it also
makes a more striking display of its shapes,
than in any former part of life; the neck
grows thin and fine; the withers grow sharp,
and give an appearance of increased length
and obliquity to the shoulder; the back
sinks; the quarters assume a more blood-like
turn, and seem to lengthen; tumors of
all kinds, spavins, splents, windgalls, &amp;c.
generally become in part or wholly absorbed;
the legs feel sinewy and free from puff, though
they may evince instability and weakness.
Now-a-days it is not often that we meet with
horses thus advanced in years; still more
rarely with any that have grown decrepit
from age.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The horse, if properly treated, will live to
a great age. The best time of his life is
considered to be betwixt that of five and ten
years, although there have been instances
where he has proved highly serviceable until
twenty years; and it is on record, that some
horses have wrought till upwards of thirty
years old. Mares are said to be aged at
seven years old, and horses at eight.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>The Age of Dogs.</i>—These animals do not,
like horses and cattle, present any exact criterion
of their age; nevertheless, attention to
the following appearances will assist us in
determining the matter. At about four years,
the front teeth lose their points, and each of
them presents a flattened surface, which increases
as the age advances; they likewise
lose their whiteness. In dogs fed much on
bones, and in those who “<i>fetch and carry</i>,”
these teeth suffer very much, and are sometimes
broken out while the dog is yet young.
The holders, or tusks, are also blunted by
the same causes. At seven or eight, the hair
about the eyes becomes slightly grey. Gradually,
likewise, a greyish tint extends over
the face; but it is not till ten, eleven, or
twelve years, that the eyes lose their lustre:
when they become dim, general decay proceeds
rapidly, though the life of some dogs is extended
to fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen years;
and I have seen a mother and son vigorous
at twenty and twenty-one years old. Although
such instances as the latter must be considered
as rare, yet even these have been exceeded,
if I might depend on my authority; for I once
saw a small French dog, which I was assured
had reached his twenty-fourth year, and which,
at the time I saw him, was still vigorous and
lively. I am not aware that much difference
exists between the various breeds, as to the
age they arrive at: spaniels, however, I have
observed, are usually long lived; while terriers,
on the contrary, I have seldom observed
very old. The usual life of the dog may be
considered as ranging between twelve and
fifteen years: domestication has tended, in
some degree, to curtail the period, but not so
much as might have been expected, considering
the powerful operation of artificial habits.—<i>White</i>—<i>Percival</i>—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Air-cells of Birds.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>The lungs of birds have several openings,
communicating with corresponding air-bags or
cells, which fill the whole cavity of the body
from the neck downwards, and into which the
air passes and re-passes in the process of
breathing. This is not all: the very bones of
birds are hollowed out with the design of
receiving air from the lungs, from which air-pipes
are conveyed to the most solid parts of
the body, and even into the quills and plumelets
of the feathers, which are hollow or
spongy for its reception. As all these hollow
parts, as well as the cells, are only open on
the side communicating with the lungs, the
bird requires only to take in a full breath to
fill and distend its whole body with air, which,
in consequence of the considerable heat of its
body, is rendered much lighter than the air
of the atmosphere. By forcing this air out of
the body again, the weight becomes so much
increased, that birds of large size can dart
down from great heights in the air with astonishing
velocity. The structure of insects is
not a little analogous.—<i>Ins. Trans.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Air-gun</span>, <i>s.</i> A species of gun charged with air instead of powder.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The <i>air-gun</i>, although long known, has
never been much used, as its slight report is
the only advantage it can possess over fire-arms,
while its danger and inefficiency are
admitted. Fatal accidents have occurred in
charging it, and every attempt to remedy the
danger has been unsuccessful. In the old
principle, the globe or ball which forms the
receiver has frequently blown up while the air
was being pumped in, and loss of life or severe
injury resulted. Latterly, the attention
of several experimentalists has been directed
to its improvement. One of them, Mr. Laing,
of the Haymarket, imagined he had overcome
the great objection; and by a very ingenious
alteration, in which the globe was done away
with, and the air-receiver transferred to the
stock of the gun, he hoped thus to have removed
the danger. But in this he was sadly
disappointed. While trying the improved air-gun,
the receiver burst, injured him severely,
and induced him to abandon any farther experiments
with this dangerous instrument.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed, the manifest inferiority of the air-gun
to the rifle, would, independently of its
danger, prevent it from coming into general
use. As an instrument, it is extremely troublesome
to shoot with, and liable to constant
derangement. Its power is very weak, and
in accuracy of aim the rifle is far superior.
Even the advantage of slight report in the discharge
is now comparatively done away with, in
consequence of the recent introduction of the
small-bore rifles for rook and rabbit shooting;
which, from the trifling quantity of powder
used in charging, are scarcely louder than the
air-gun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Purday, whose reputation as a rifle maker
is deservedly high, has brought them to great
perfection; and some beautiful guns of this
description may be seen at his manufactory,
which, though so small in the gage as to require
bullets eighty to the pound, are perfect
alike in execution and workmanship.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the <i>Air-cane</i>, though a
more recent invention, it is only necessary to
say, that it has all the disadvantages of the
air-gun, with much weaker power, and a
greater liability to get out of order. It is a
mere toy, and, certainly, a very dangerous
one.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Formerly, poachers were in the habit of
using air-guns to destroy pheasants in the preserves.
The instrument made no noise, and
the operator preferred the boisterous, rainy
night, when the moon was nearly at the full;
the wet did not in the least affect the discharge
of this implement, and the keepers
knew a common gun could not be effectually
employed in such tempestuous weather; besides,
the report caused immediate alarm,
and frequent detection. Vast numbers of
pheasants were carried off, before this practice
was discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Mr. Tyssen was partial to an air-gun
for shooting rooks, rabbits, &amp;c., and was
using one at Donyland Park, in Essex, when
the screw of the valve gave way, as the servant
was pumping the air into it; the copper
ball fortunately took such a direction, that no
one was hurt; but, in passing through the
trees, it cut off some considerable branches.
This accident staggered his confidence in the
security of their principle, and from the best
informed persons he consulted upon the subject,

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Alkali</span>, <i>s.</i> Any substance which combines with an acid, and produces a

<p class='c006'><i>Alkalies</i> form one of the classes of saline
bodies, and are of three kinds: the <i>vegetable
alkali</i>—kali, or potash,—the <i>mineral
alkali</i>—soda, or natron,—and the <i>volatile
alkali</i>, or ammonia. <i>Alkalies</i> are distinguished
by their changing blue vegetable
colours to a green, and yellow to orange; by
combining rapidly with acids, and forming
with them neutral salts—and by rendering
oils miscible with water. <i>Vegetable</i> and <i>mineral
alkalies</i>, not being evaporable, except
in a high degree of heat, are termed <i>fixed</i>:
and <i>ammonia</i>, being evaporable in a low

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Allspice</span>, <i>s.</i> Jamaica pepper, a powerful cordial and carminative; the dose
from two to three or four drachms. Mr. Bracey Clarke, in a book he has
published on flatulent or spasmodic colic, or gripes, strongly recommends
a tincture of allspice in proof spirit, as an effectual remedy for
that disorder. The dose about 4 to 6 oz. in water.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Allure</span>, <i>v.</i> To entice to any thing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Aloes</span>, <i>s.</i> A precious wood used in the east for perfumes, of which the
best sort is of higher price than gold; a tree which grows in hot countries;
a medicinal juice extracted from the common aloes tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aloes is the inspissated juice of a plant
of the same name, and is an effectual purgative
for horses. It is intensely bitter, and
strong and unpleasant to the smell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Socotrine aloes is grown in the island Socotra,
and is safer in its operation than the
other kinds. It is of a dark reddish or brown
colour, opaque, and less disagreeable to smell
than the others. It formerly sold at a high
price, and was therefore liable to adulteration.
Barbadoes aloes is a coarser medicine, liable to
produce griping, and other unpleasant effects;
but it is a safe and efficacious purgative.
It is darker coloured, less brittle, and of a
stronger and more disagreeable smell—more
active than the Socotrine; and considered
more certain in its operation. Every kind of
aloes is liable to produce bad consequences if
given too largely, or if the horse be treated
improperly while under its effect. There is
a peculiarity in the horse’s intestines which
renders them more liable to be injured by
purgatives than those of other domestic animals,
and therefore cathartic medicines should
be prepared by persons of judgment and experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cape aloes is rather transparent, very brittle,
easily powdered, in this state of a bright
yellow colour; the odour arising from it is
not so strong as the Barbadoes, but stronger
and less agreeable than the Socotrine. This
kind is sold at a much lower price than the
others, but is so weak and uncertain in its
effect, that it is seldom employed in veterinary
medicine. The dose of Socotrine aloes is from
five to nine, Barbadoes from four to six, and
Cape from six to ten drachms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aloes operates more speedily when united
with soap, or any of the fixed alkalies. In
old books cream of tartar is prescribed with
aloes, under the supposition that it prevented
griping, but soap is preferable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aloes is sometimes given as an alterative in
doses of one or two drachms. It is also an
ingredient in Friar’s balsam, and compound
tincture of myrrh; preparations much used by
farriers.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The spaniel of St. Bernard exceeds all
others of the same tribe in size and beauty.
He generally reaches two feet in height at the
shoulders, and is upwards of five feet from the
nose to the tip of the tail. His coat is much
more curled than that of either the springer
or the cocker, and his hair is very closely set,
with short woolly fur at the roots; his feet
like those of all the dogs of cold climates, are
protected from the possibility of being cut by
the frost, by being covered with a thick fur,
which, besides, enables him to climb those
almost inaccessible ridges of ice which are so
numerous on the Great St. Bernard. There
is a peculiarity about the corners of the eyes
of this dog which is attributed to the snow,
and the high Alpine regions which he inhabits.</p>

<p class='c006'>In point of intelligence, the Alpine spaniel
may be reckoned at least equal to any of the
species; and he has the greatest aptitude for
learning anything to which he may be trained.
He is peculiarly adapted to those stormy regions,
the Swiss Alps; and Providence, in
the wisdom of its arrangements, seems to have
placed him where he was to be most serviceable
to mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>These dogs are kept by the monks of the
monasteries of the Swiss Alps for the express
purpose of searching, during heavy snow
storms, for travellers who may have fallen
into cavities or pits, in which situation, without
timely assistance, they would soon be
starved or frozen to death. The practice is to
send them out in pairs, and being perfectly
conversant with the nature of their employment,
they traverse a great extent of the
adjoining country. By marks in the snow,
but principally from the scent formed from the
breath of persons so situated exhaling through
the drift, they discover the pit that contains
the buried traveller; in which case they
instantly return and give the alarm, when
assistance being procured, these sagacious
animals lead the benevolent monks to the
relief of the unfortunate individual.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following anecdote appears to be well
authenticated:—In crossing the mountain St.
Gothard, near Airola, the Chevalier Gaspard
de Brandenberg and his servant were buried
by an avalanche; his dog, who escaped the
heap of snow, did not quit the place where he
had lost his master: this was fortunately not
far from the convent; the animal howled, ran
to the convent frequently, and then returned;
struck by his perseverance, the next morning
the people from the house followed him; he
led them directly to the spot, scratched the
snow, and after thirty-six hours passed beneath
it, the Chevalier and his domestic were taken
out safe, hearing distinctly, during their confinement,
the howling of the dog, and the discourse
of their deliverers. Sensible that to
the sagacity and fondness of this creature he
owed his life, the gentleman ordered by his
will, that he should be represented on his
tomb with his dog; and at Zug, in the church
of St. Oswald, where he was buried in 1728,
they still show the monument, and the effigy
of the gentleman, with the dog lying at his
feet.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

in cleansing ulcers, and for this purpose
usually combined with red precipitate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alum is produced by placing a quantity of

<p class='c006'>In horses, this disease is caused by a pressure

in the earlier stages may be relieved by

<p class='c006'>The removal of amburies, or warts, is commonly
effected by a tight ligature of silk; but,
in every case, no matter where the wart may
be, the use of the knife is preferable. Some
farriers touch them with arsenic, mixed with
a little soft soap; but this is a dangerous
method, and often produces a serious degree
of inflammation and sloughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farriers generally endeavour to get rid of
wens by blistering, but this never answers;
and sometimes they use arsenic and soap;
but this is not only very dangerous, but
generally ineffectual also. The knife is the
safest, most expeditious, and most effectual
remedy for wens, and every kind of encysted
tumour. When a considerable artery is opened
in cutting out a wen, the bleeding may be
stopped by tying it, by means of a tenaculum
or a crooked needle, or the bleeding vessel may
be laid hold of by a pair of forceps and tied.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>American Game</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The woodcocks are, in all respects, like
those in England, except that they are only
about three-fifths of the size. They breed
here, and are in such numbers, that some
men kill twenty brace or more in a day.
Their haunts are in marshy places or woods.
The shooting of them lasts from the 4th of
July, till the hardish frosts come. Here are
five months of this sort, and pheasants and
partridges are shot from September to April.</p>

<p class='c006'>The snipes are called English snipes, which
they resemble in all respects, and are found
in great abundance in the usual haunts of
snipes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The grouse is precisely like the Scotch
grouse. There is only here and there a place
where they are found; but they are, in those
places, killed in vast quantities, in the fall
of the year.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the wild ducks and other water-fowl,
which are come at by lying in wait, and
killed most frequently swimming or sitting,
they are slaughtered in whole flocks. An
American counts the cost of powder and shot.
If he is deliberate in everything else, this
habit will hardly forsake him in the act of
shooting. When the sentimental flesh-eaters
hear the report of his gun, they may begin to
pull out their white handkerchiefs, for death
follows the pull of his trigger, with perhaps
even more certainty than it used to follow the
lancet of Dr. Rush.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plover is a fine bird, and is found in
great numbers upon the plains and in the cultivated
fields of the islands. Plovers are very
shy and wary, but they have ingenious enemies
to deal with. A waggon or carriage of
some sort is made use of to approach them,
and then they are easily killed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rabbits are very abundant in some places.
They are killed by shooting, for all here is
done with gun—no reliance is placed upon a

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Anas</span>, <i>s.</i> The generic name of the duck tribe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duck, a genus thus characterised.
Bill middle size, strong, straight, more or less
depressed, covered with a thin skin, often
more raised than broad at the base, which is
either furnished with a fleshy substance or
quite smooth, always depressed towards the
point, which is rounded, blunt, and clawed,
margins of the two mandibles toothed with
plates, of either a flat or a conical form.
Nostrils almost at the surface of the bill, at
some distance from the base, somewhat oval,
half closed by the flat membrane which lines
the nostril. Legs short, feathered to the
knees, drawn back towards the belly; three
toes before, wholly webbed; hind toe free,
articulated higher up on the flank, without a
membrane, or having only the rudiments
thereof. Wings of middle size; the first
quill either as long as the second or rather
shorter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Temminck divides the genus into four
sections. 1. The Goose; 2. The Swan;
3. The Duck. A. Ducks having the hind
claw naked. B. Ducks having the hind claw
covered with a loose membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>This genus, in which ornithologists have
included all the Swans, Geese, and Ducks,
amounts, according to the latest enumeration,
to ninety-eight species, and about fourteen
varieties; thirty-three of the former, and one
of the latter, are accounted British birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the swan downward to the teal, they
are all of a clean-plumaged, beautiful race of
birds, and some of them exquisitely so. Those
which have been reclaimed from a state of
nature, and live dependent on man, are extremely
useful to him; under his protection
they breed in great abundance, and without
requiring much of his time or care, lead their
young to the pool almost as soon as they are
hatched, where they instantly, with instinctive
perception, begin to search for their food,
which at first consists chiefly of weeds, worms,
and insects; these they sift, as it were, from
the mud, and for that purpose their bills are
admirably adapted. When they are further
advanced in life, they pick up the sodden
scattered grain of the farm-yard; which, but
for their assiduous searchings, would be lost.
To them also are allotted large quantities of
corn which are shaken by the winds from the
over-ripened ears in the field. On this clean
and simple food they soon become fat, and
their flesh is accounted delicious and nourishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a wild state, birds of various kinds preserve
their original plumage; but when tamed
they soon begin to vary, and show the effects of
domestication: this is the case with the tame
goose and the duck, which differ as much
from the wild of their respective kinds, as
they do from each other.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Anasarca</span>, <i>s.</i> A general dropsy, consisting of a watery fluid lodged
beneath the skin.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Anasarca</i> arises from debility or inflammation.
The former occurs to old horses when
turned out into poor or marshy pasture, and
is indicated by general swelling of the belly,
chest, and hind legs; it generally ends fatally
unless strong diuretics and sudorifics are employed;
and these are combined in the celebrated
old drench of Markham, which has
cured more horses of this disorder than any
other remedy; and is considered in the low
country, about Glastonbury and Wedmoor,
where this disease is prevalent, an infallible
remedy. It consists of a decoction of wormwood
in a gallon of ale, which is boiled down
to two quarts, and skimmed. In this one
ounce of Castile soap is dissolved, and then
there is to be stirred in six drachms of grains of
paradise, powdered, and the same quantity of
long pepper. The whole of this mixture is
given at once, fasting. The horse to be clothed
and rode about until he sweats and stales
profusely, which he soon does, and is then
relieved. The horse is often capable of doing
some work after his recovery; but the constitution
of such horses is generally too far
broken to receive any permanent benefit from
this or any other treatment. The other kind
of dropsy, or that which depends on a high
degree of general inflammation, most commonly
attacks colts during the first, second, or third
year, or before they begin to change their
grinding teeth. At this period there is less
blood formed, not only from the state of the
grinding teeth, the gums, and the mouth in
general, which is such as to render mastication
painful and imperfect, but from the
stomach sympathising with this state of the
mouth. This disorder in young colts is first
observed by dulness, disinclination to motion,
hanging the head, and indifference in grazing.
There are swellings also on the belly, chest,
sheath, or udder, which are sometimes very
considerable. When these symptoms are observed,
the colt should be taken up and bled
until he is quite faint, or drops down from
faintness. Nothing more is necessary, unless
it is turning him into a place where he can
have but little food and sufficient exercise.
Markham’s drench has been given to colts
when affected with the Moor ill, as the disorder
is termed, with success.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In dogs, this complaint very seldom occurs,
unless as an accompaniment of the ascites.
I have, however, now and then seen it, and,
in most of the cases, it was in old dogs who
had laboured under some previous debility.
In such instances, when any remaining stamina
affords a chance for recovery, the treatment
recommended for dropsy of the belly
may be resorted to: very small punctures
may also be made in the distended skin.—<i>White</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Angler</i> will take care, when he means

kind of lines neatly coiled up, strong single
hairs, hooks untied of divers sorts, and also
tied to bottom links of coarse and fine gimp
of twisted and single silk worm gut, of hog’s
bristles, and of white and sorrel hair; likewise
to be provided with cork and quill floats, and
spare caps. Shot split, and small pistol bullets
to poise the floats; shoemaker’s wax in a
piece of leather (if the wax be too stiff, temper
it with tallow); silk of various sizes and
colours; recollecting, that hooks for worm
fishing, and red paste, are usually tied on
with scarlet; and those for gentles, yellow
paste, and grubs with straw-coloured silk; a
plummet to ascertain the depth of the water
when a float is used; a clearing ring to disentangle
the hook, which is used by running it along
and over the top of the rod, and gradually
down the line (holding it by a strong twine,
long enough for any such purpose) to where
the hook is fast, if at a stump or other immoveable
substance; but if it be hung to
weeds, let the ring get below the hook, then
pull the twine, and the ring will break the
weeds, and thus save both line and hook; in
the former case, if it does not release the
hook, it will enable the line to be broken
near to it, and prevent the line from being
strained in any other part. A sharp pen-knife,
a pair of scissors, a small whetstone about two
inches long and a quarter of an inch square, are
indispensible. A landing-net, the iron hoop
made with joints, and a socket to contain a
handle for it; some use a light hook that
screws into a long staff, which not only secures
the taking of a large fish out of the water,
but also is a useful implement in disengaging
the line from weeds or boughs of trees. A
disgorger to put down the throat of a fish
when he has swallowed the hook, until it is
touched, when by pulling the line gently at
the same time that the instrument presses
down the hook, it will be freed. These may
be made of a piece of split cane five or six
inches long, and a quarter of an inch wide,
with a notch at each end. Baits should be
carried, the gentles, pastes, and natural flies,
in tin boxes; for the latter, with holes punched
in the top to admit air. He will likewise not
be without worms of different sorts in canvass
and woollen bags, and a larger one for malt
or other ground bait: to hold the baits, it is
far better to have something like a fish-woman’s
apron, with three or four partitions
(made as below), than to dangle the gentle-case
or worm-bags from a button. A piece
of coarse cloth, three quarters in length and
breadth, doubled to within three inches at
one side; which three inches must be doubled
back again, and sewed all along close to the
first doubling to receive a belt; the great
doubling at each side is then to be sewed up,
so that the foreside may allow room for the
hand to go easily into the pockets, which will
be ten inches deep; and when stitched in
three places, will leave four divisions, each
four inches broad. The fishbasket, pannier,
or creel, as they are made very neat and light
in wicker-work, should be large enough to
admit the fish to lie at full length; they are
thus better preserved, both in appearance and
for use, than when bent and crushed together;
some persons carry their pannier at their back,
others under the left arm, having the side
nearest them rather hollowed: in these baskets
are sometimes a partition at the top, for
holding night lines, &amp;c.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Angling</span>, <i>p.</i> The art of fishing with a rod and line.</p>

<p class='c006'>Angling came into general repute in England
about the period of the Reformation,
when both the secular and regular clergy,
being prohibited by the common law from the
amusement of hunting, hawking, and fowling,
directed their attention to this recreation.
The invention of printing assisted in exciting
attention to this subject, and made known its
importance “to cause the helthe of your body,
and specyally of your soul,” as the first treatise
quaintly concludes. Wynkin de Worde
gave the world, in 1496, a small folio republication
of the celebrated Book of St. Albans.
It contained, for the first time, a curious
tract, entitled the Treatyse of Fysshinge with
an Angle; embellished with a wood cut of the
angler. This treatise is imputed to Dame
Juliana Berners, or Barnes, prioress of a nunnery
near St. Albans. “The angler,” she
observes, “atte the least hath his holsom
walke and mery at his ease, a swete ayre of
the swete savoure of the meede flowers that
makyth him hungary; he hereth the melodyous
armony of the fowles, he seeth the yonge
swannes, heerons, duckes, cotes, and many
other fowles, with their brodes, whych me
seemyth better than alle the noyse of the
houndys, the blast of hornys, and the scrye of
fowles, that hunters, fawkeners, and fowlers,
can make. And if angler take fysshe, surely
thenne is there noo man merier than he is
in his spyryte?” The Book of St. Albans
contains “Treatises perteynynge to Hawkynge
and Huntynge,” as well as “Fysshinge with
an Angle;” and several editions of it were
printed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;
as that under the title of “The Gentleman’s
Academie in 1595;” “The Jewel
for Gentrie in 1674.” Mr. Haselwood, a
learned biographer, has recently favoured the
public with a well finished <i>fac-simile</i> reprint
of the work, but he disputes the claim of the
fair lady above mentioned to be the authoress
of the above treatise on angling, and only assigns
her a small portion of the treatise on
hawking, the entire treatise on hunting, a
list of the beasts of chase, and another of
birds and fowls.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walton’s inimitable “Discourse on Angling”
was first printed in 1653, in an elegant
duodecimo, with plates of the most considerable
fish cut in steel. This edition, and three
subsequent ones, consisted wholly of what is
now called part the first of the “Complete
Angler,” or Walton’s individual portion of the
work. While engaged in 1676, being the
eighty-third year of his age, in preparing the
fifth edition, he received from his friend,
Charles Cotton, Esq., a gentleman in Derbyshire,
“Instructions how to angle for a Trout
or Grayling in a clear Stream,” as they were
first called, which afterwards became part the
second of this joint publication.</p>

<p class='c006'>Angling has been thought of sufficient importance
to be protected by statute. This first
occurred in the reign of Edward I., when imprisonment
and treble damages were awarded
against all that should trespass on the rights
of authorised fishers. By the 31 Hen.
VIII. c. 2, s. 2, it was enacted, “If any evil
disposed persons shall fish in the day time,
from six in the morning to six in the evening,
in any ponds, stews, or moats, with nets,
hooks, or bait, against the will of the owners,
they shall, on the conviction thereof, at the
suit of the king, or the party aggrieved, suffer
imprisonment for the space of three months,
and find security for their good behaviour.”
By the 5 Eliz., c. 21, s. 2, it is enacted,
“If any person shall unlawfully break or
destroy any head or dam of a fish pond, or
shall wrongfully fish therein, with intent to
take or kill fish, he shall, on conviction at the
assizes or sessions, at the suit of the king or
the party injured, be imprisoned three months
and pay treble damages; and after the expiration
of the said three months, shall find
sureties for good behaviour for seven years to
come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>By the 22 &amp; 23 Car. II. c. 25, s. 7, it
is enacted, “That if any person shall, at
any time, use any casting net, drag net,
shore net, or other net whatsoever; or any
angle, hair, noose, troll, or spear; or shall lay
any wears, pots, nets, fish-hooks, or other engines;
or shall take any fish by any means
whatsoever, in any river, stew, moat, pond,
or other water, or shall be aiding thereunto,
without the consent of the owner of the water,
and be convicted thereof within one month
after the offence committed, such offender
shall give to the party injured such satisfaction
as a justice shall appoint, not exceeding
treble damages; and pay the overseers of the
poor such sum, not exceeding 10<i>s.</i>, as the
justice shall think fit: in default of payment,
the said penalties to be levied by distress; or
the offender to be committed to the house of
correction for a term not exceeding one month,
unless he enter into a bond, with surety, in
a sum not exceeding £10, never to offend
in like manner.” Justices are also authorised
to destroy all such articles as before recited
and adapted to the taking of fish, as may be
found in the possession of offenders when
taken. Persons aggrieved may appeal to the
quarter sessions, whose judgment shall be
final.</p>

<p class='c006'>And by the 4 &amp; 5 William and Mary
it is enacted, “That no person (except
makers and sellers of nets, owners of a river
or fishery, authorised fishermen and their apprentices)
shall keep any net, angle, leap,
pike, or rather engine, for taking of fish. The
proprietor of any river or fishery, or persons
by them authorised, may seize, and keep to
his own use, any engine which shall be found
in the custody of any person fishing in any
river or fishery, without the consent of the
owner or occupier. And such owner, occupier,
or person authorised by either, sanctioned
by the consent of any justice, in the day
time, may search the houses or other places
of any unqualified person, who shall be suspected
of having such nets, or other engines
in his possession, and the same to seize and
keep to their own use, or cut in pieces and
destroy.” Stealing fish in disguise is made
felony of by the 9 Geo. I. c. 22. “If
any person armed and disguised shall unlawfully
steal, or take away, any fish out
of any river or pond, (whether armed or not,)
shall unlawfully and maliciously break down
the head or mound of any fish pond, whereby
the fish shall be lost and destroyed, or shall
rescue any person in custody for any such
offence, or procure any other to join him
therein, he shall be guilty of felony without
benefit of clergy.” This (commonly called
the Black Act) is made perpetual by 31
Geo. II. c. 42.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the 5 Geo. III. c. 14, s. 1, it is enacted,
“That if any person shall enter into
any park or paddock enclosed, or into any
garden, orchard, or yard, belonging to, or adjoining
to, any dwelling-house, wherein shall
be any river, pond, moat, or other water, and,
by any means whatsoever, (without the consent
of the owner,) steal, kill, or destroy, any
fish, bred, kept, or preserved therein, or shall
be assisting therein, or shall receive or buy
any such fish, knowing them to be such, shall,
upon conviction, be transported for seven
years. Persons making confession of such
offence, and giving evidence against an accomplice,
who, in pursuance thereof, shall be
convicted, will be entitled to a free pardon.”
And by the same act, section 3, it is provided,
“That if any person shall take, kill, or destroy,
or attempt to take, kill, or destroy, any fish in
any river or stream, pool, pond, or any other
water, (not being in any park or paddock enclosed,
or in any garden, orchard, or yard,
belonging or adjoining to a dwelling-house,
but in any other enclosed ground, being private
property,) such person being thereof convicted
by confession, or the oath of one witness
before a justice, shall forfeit five pounds
to the owner of the fishery of such river or
other water; and in default thereof shall be
committed to the house of correction for a
time not exceeding six months.”</p>

<p class='c006'>By the 1 Eliz. c. 17, “All fishermen are
forbidden to destroy the fry of fish, small
salmon and trout, under a penalty of twenty
shillings;” and by the 4 &amp; 5 Anne, for the
protection of salmon in the counties of Southampton
and Wilts, no salmon shall be taken
between the first of August and twelfth of
November. Statutes of Geo. I. and II., forbid
the same fish to be taken in the rivers
Severn, Wye, Ware, Ouse, &amp;c., under eighteen
inches long.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is held that when the lord of the manor
has the soil on both sides of the river, as in
the case of the Severn, the right of fishing
goes with it; and he who intrudes thereon
must prove his claim of a free fishery; but
when the tide ebbs and flows, and the river
is an arm of the sea, as in the case of the
Thames, the right is presumed to be common,
and he who claims a privilege must prove
it.—<i>Ency. Lon.</i> (<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Fish</span>, <span class='sc'>Fishing</span>, &amp;c.

A variety of vegetables have been thought
to possess this quality, but I believe without
foundation; among these are box, rue, savin,
and wormwood. Æthiop’s mineral, antimony,
sulphur, and tin, have also been considered as
anthelminthics. I believe tin has not been
fairly tried: and as it is an efficacious anthelminthic
in dogs, it may probably be found useful
in horses. Of all the mercurial preparations,
calomel is by far the best for this
purpose, and may be given with aloes, soap,
and some aromatic oil, with a little ginger.
Many prefer giving the calomel at night, and
the purgative the following morning. Aloes
are a good anthelminthic. A saline substance
was some time ago introduced from India, as
a remedy for that species of worm termed <i>botts</i>.
It seems to be composed of common salt and
liver of sulphur, but it does not appear to
deserve the high character that was given of
it; though, like salt or brine, it may sometimes
have been found an effectual anthelminthic.—<i>White.</i>

<p class='c006'>This is, I believe, an inflammatory disorder,

and often end fatally, in France and

in a painful swelling of the breast and

<p class='c006'>Antiseptics are medicines which prevent

wine, ether, ammonia, and camphor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses do not appear to be subject to those

putrid. In gangrene, or mortification of the

employed, which are made by boiling wormwood,

<p class='c006'>Antispasmodics in veterinary practice possess
the power of allaying inordinate or painful
motions in the system, particularly those
involuntary contractions in parts which are
naturally subject to the command of the will.</p>

<p class='c006'>Medical writers divide antispasmodics into
two kinds, viz. stimulants and sedatives. To
the former belong arsenic, preparations of
copper, zinc, and iron; also, ammonia, ether,
essential oils, &amp;c. The latter comprehends
opium, musk, camphor, and all the vegetable
narcotics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Medicines of the fœtid kind, such as galbanum,
assaœtida, &amp;c., have also an antispasmodic
quality.</p>

<p class='c006'>When spasm arises from irritation, sedatives
are to be given; but when it depends merely
on debility, tonics are evidently proper. The
spasmodic complaints to which horses are
liable, are locked jaw and spasmodic or flatulent
colic, commonly named gripes, in which
the most efficacious antispasmodic is opium;
but it is generally joined with others, such as
camphor, assaœtida, ether, oil of peppermint,
juniper, caraways, or allspice, or other aromatics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spices and aromatic seeds, such as cinnamon,
cloves, ginger, caraways, aniseed, &amp;c.,
are often joined with opium, either in powder
or infused with it in proof spirit, to form a
tincture, and will be found a good antispasmodic
in that form.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Arabian.</i>—Of all the countries in
the world where the horse runs wild, Arabia
produces the most beautiful breed—the most
generous, swift, and persevering. They are
found, though not in great numbers, in the
deserts of that country, and the natives use
every stratagem to take them. Although they
are active and beautiful, yet they are not so
large as those bred up tame. They are of a
brown colour, their mane and tail very short,
and the hair black and tufted. Their swiftness
is incredible; the attempt to pursue them
in the usual manner of the chace, with dogs,
would be entirely fruitless: such is the rapidity
of their flight, that they are instantly out
of view, and the dogs themselves give up the
vain pursuit. The only method, therefore,
of taking them is by traps hidden in the sand,
which entangling their feet, the hunter at
length comes up, and either kills them or
carries them home alive. If the horse be
young, he is considered among the Arabians
as a very great delicacy, and they feast upon
him while any part is found remaining; but
if from his shape or vigour he promises to be
serviceable in his more noble capacity, they
take the usual methods of taming him by
fatigue and hunger, and he soon becomes a
useful domestic animal. But the horses thus
caught, or trained in this manner, are at present
very few; the value of Arabian horses
all over the world has, in a great measure,
thinned the deserts of the wild breed, and
there are few to be found in those countries,
except such as are tame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Arabian breed has been diffused into
Barbary as well as Egypt, and into Persia also.
Those from the former country are usually
denominated “Barbs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Let the Arab be ever so poor, he has
horses: they usually ride on the mares, experience
having taught them that they bear
fatigue, hunger, and thirst, better than horses;
they also are less vicious, more gentle, and
will remain, left to themselves, in great numbers,
for days together, without doing the least
injury to each other. The Turks, on the
contrary, do not like mares, and the Arabians
sell them the horses which they do not keep
for stallions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Arabs have no houses, but constantly
live in tents, which serve them also for stables,
so that the husband, the wife, and the
children, lie promiscuously with the mare
and foal. The little children are often seen
upon the body or the neck of the mare, while
these continue inoffensive and harmless, permitting
them thus to play with and caress
them without injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Arabs never beat their horses; they
treat them gently; they speak to them, and
seem to hold a discourse; they use them as
friends; they never attempt to increase their
speed by the whip, nor spur them, but in cases
of necessity;—however, when this happens
they set off with amazing swiftness, they leap
over obstacles with as much agility as a buck,
and if the rider happens to fall, they are so
manageable that they stand still in the midst
of their most rapid career.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Arabian horses are of a middle size,
easy in their motions, and rather inclined to
leanness than fat. They are regularly dressed
every morning and evening, and with such
care, that the smallest roughness is not left
upon their skins. They wash the legs, the
mane, and the tail; the two latter they never
cut, and very seldom comb, lest they should
thin the hair.</p>

<p class='c006'>They give them nothing to eat during the
day; they only give them to drink once or
twice, and at sunset they hang a bag to their
heads, in which there is about half a bushel
of clean barley: they continue eating the
whole night, and the bag is again taken away
the next morning. They are turned out to
pasture in the beginning of March, when the
grass is pretty high. When the spring is past
they take them again from pasture, and then
they get neither grass nor hay during the rest
of the year; barley is their only food, except
now and then a little straw. The mane of
the foal is always clipped when about a year
or eighteen months old, in order to make it
stronger and thicker; they begin to break
them at two years old, or two years and a half
at farthest; they never saddle or bridle them
till at that age, and then they are always
kept ready saddled at the door of the tent,
from morning till sunset, in order to be prepared
against any surprise. They at present
seem sensible of the great advantage their
horses are to the country; there is a law,
therefore, that prohibits the exportation of
the mares, and such stallions as are brought
into England are generally purchased on the
eastern shores of Africa, and come round to
us by the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Arabs preserve the pedigree of their
horses with great care, and for several ages
back. They distinguish the races by different
names, and divide them into three classes;
the first is that of the nobles, the ancient
breed, and unadulterated on either side;
the second, that of the horses of the ancient
race, but adulterated; and the third the
common and inferior kind: the last they
sell at a low price, but those of the first
class, and even of the second, amongst which
are found horses of equal value to the former,
are sold extremely dear. They know, by long
experience, the race of a horse by his appearance;
they can tell the name, the surname,
the colour, and the marks properly belonging
to each. When the mare has produced the
foal, witnesses are called, and an attestation
signed, in which are described the marks of
the foal, and the day noted when it was
brought forth. These attestations increase
the value of the horse, and are given to the
person who buys him. The most ordinary
mare of this race sells for five hundred
crowns; there are many that sell for a thousand,
and some of the very finest kinds for
fourteen or fifteen hundred pounds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Eighty or one hundred piastres are given
for an ordinary horse, which is in general less
valued than an ass or mule; but a horse of a
well known Arabian breed will fetch any price.
Abdallah, pacha of Damascus, had just given
three thousand piastres for one. The history
of a horse is frequently the topic of general
conversation. When I was at Jerusalem, the
feats of one of these steeds made a great noise.
The Bedouin, to whom the animal, a mare,
belonged, being pursued by the governor’s
guards, rushed with her from the top of the
hills that overlooked Jericho. The mare
scoured at full gallop an almost perpendicular
declivity without stumbling, and left the soldiers
lost in admiration and astonishment.
The poor creature, however, dropped down
dead on entering Jericho, and the Bedouin,
who would not quit her, was taken weeping
over the body of his companion. This mare
has a brother in the desert, who is so famous,
that the Arabs always know where he has
been, where he is, what he is doing, and how
he does. Ali Aga religiously showed me, in
the mountains near Jericho, the footsteps of
the mare that died in the attempt to save her
master,—a Macedonian could not have beheld
those of Bucephalus with greater respect.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The pure Arabians are somewhat smaller
than our race horses, seldom exceeding fourteen
hands two inches in height. Their heads
are very beautiful, clean, and wide between
the jaws; the forehead is broad and square;
the face flat; the muzzle short and fine; the
eyes prominent and brilliant; the ears small
and handsome; the nostrils large and open;
the skin of the head thin, through which may
be distinctly traced the whole of the veins;
the neck rather short than otherwise. The
body may, as a whole, be considered too
light, and the breast rather narrow; but
behind the arms, the chest generally swells
out greatly, leaving ample room for the lungs
to play, and with great depth of ribs. The
shoulder is superior to that of any other
breed; the scapula, or shoulder-blade, inclines
backwards nearly an angle of forty-five
degrees; the withers are high and arched;
the neck beautifully curved; the mane and
tail long, thin, and flowing: the legs are fine,
flat, and wiry, with the posteriors placed
somewhat oblique, which has led some to suppose
that their strength was thereby lessened—but
this is by no means the case; the bone
is of uncommon density; and the prominent
muscles of the fore arms and thigh, prove
that the Arabian horse is fully equal to all
that has been said of its physical powers.
The Arabian is never known, in a tropical
climate, to be a roarer, or to have curbs, the
shape, from the point of the hock to the fetlock,
being very perfect. It is a remarkable
fact, that the skin of all the light-coloured
Arabians is pure black, or bluish black, which
gives to white horses that beautiful silvery
gray colour so prevalent among the coursers
of noble blood. Bay and chestnut are also
common, and considered good colours. It
has been remarked in India, that no horse of
a dark gray colour was ever known to be a
winner on the turf. If an Arabian horse
exceed fourteen and a half hands in height,
the purity of his blood is always doubted in
India.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking of the docile character of the
Arab horse, the late Bishop of Calcutta
writes: “My morning rides are very pleasant.
My horse is a nice, quiet, good-tempered
little Arab, who is so fearless,
that he goes, without starting, close to an
elephant, and so gentle and docile, that he
eats bread out of my hand, and has almost
as much attachment and coaxing ways as a
dog. This seems the general character of
the Arab horses, to judge from what I have
seen in this country. It is not the fiery,
dashing animal I had supposed, but with
more rationality about him, and more apparent
confidence in his rider, than the majority
of English horses.”—<i>Le Keux</i>—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Clarke</i>—<i>Heber.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Archery is the art or exercise of shooting
with a bow and arrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this island, archery was greatly encouraged
in former times, and many statutes
were made for the regulation thereof; whence
the English archers became the best in Europe,
and obtained many signal victories. The
Artillery Company of London, though they
have long disused the weapon, are the remains
of the ancient bowmen or archers. Artillery
(<i>artillerie</i>) is a French term, signifying archery;
as the king’s bowyer was in that language
styled <i>artillier du roy</i>. And from that
nation the English seem to have learnt at
least the use of the cross-bow. William the
Conqueror had a considerable number of
bowmen in his army, when no mention is
made of such troops on the side of Harold.
And it is supposed that these Norman archers
shot with the arbalist, or cross-bow, in which
formerly the arrow was placed in a groove,
termed in French, a quarrel, and in English,
a bolt. Of the time when shooting with the
long-bow first began among the English, there
appears no certain accounts. Their chronicles
do not mention the use of archery till
the death of Richard I.; who, in 1199, was
killed by an arrow at the siege of Limoges,
in Guienne, which Hemingford mentions to
have issued from a cross-bow. After this,
there appears no notice of archery for nearly
one hundred and fifty years; when an order
was issued by Edward III., in the fifteenth
year of his reign, to the sheriffs of most of the
English counties, for providing five hundred
white bows, and five hundred bundles of
arrows, for the then intended war against
France. Similar orders were repeated in the
following years, with this difference only, that
the sheriff of Gloucestershire is directed to
furnish five hundred painted bows, as well as
the same number of white.</p>

<p class='c006'>Philip de Comines acknowledges what our
own writers assert, that the English archers
excelled those of every other nation; and Sir
John Fortescue says “the safety of the realme
of England standyth upon archers.” And
hence the superior dexterity of their archers
gave the English a great advantage over their
capital enemies, the French and Scots.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The Normans used the bow as a military
weapon; and, under their government, the
practice of archery was not only much improved,
but generally diffused throughout the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the ages of chivalry, the usage of the
bow was considered as an essential part of
the education of a young man who wished
to make a figure in life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ladies also were fond of this amusement;
and by a curious representation from
an original drawing in a manuscript of the
fourteenth century, we see it practised by one
who has shot at a deer, and wounded it with
great adroitness; and in another previous
engraving, the hunting equipments of the
female archers, about the middle of the
fifteenth century, are represented.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was usual, when the ladies exercised the
bow, for the beasts to be confined by large
inclosures, surrounded by the hunters, and
driven in succession from the covers to the
stands, where the fair sportswomen were
placed; so that they might readily shoot at
them, without the trouble and fatigue of
rousing and pursuing them. It is said of
Margaret, the daughter of Henry VII., that
when she was on her way towards Scotland,
a hunting party was made for her amusement
in Alnwick Park, where she killed a buck
with an arrow. It is not specified whether
the long-bow or the cross-bow was used by
the princess upon this occasion: we are certain
that the ladies occasionally shot with
both; for when Queen Elizabeth visited Lord
Montacute, at Cowdrey, in Sussex, on Monday,
August 17th, 1591, “Her highness
tooke horse, and rode into the park, at eight
o’clock in the morning, where was a delicate
bowre prepared, under the which were her
highness’ musicians placed; and a cross-bow,
by a nymph, with a sweet song, was delivered
into her hands, to shoote at the deere; about
some thirty in number were put into a paddock,
of which number she killed three or
four, and the countess of Kildare one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Roger Ascham, in his instructions to the
archer, first of all recommends a graceful attitude.
He should stand, says this writer, fairly,
and upright with his body, his left foot at a convenient
distance before his right; holding the
bow by the middle, with his left arm stretched
out, and with the three first fingers and the
thumb of the right hand upon the lower part
of the arrow affixed to the string of the bow.
In the second place, a proper attention was to
be paid to the nocking, that is, the application
of the notch at the bottom of the arrow to the
bow-string: we are told that the notch of the
arrow should rest between the fore-finger and
the middle finger of the right hand. Thirdly,
our attention is directed to the proper manner
of drawing the bow-string: in ancient
times, says Ascham, the right hand was
brought to the right pap; but at present it is
elevated to the right ear, and the latter method
he prefers to the former. The shaft of the
arrow, below the feathers, ought to be rested
upon the knuckle of the fore-finger of the left
hand; the arrow was to be drawn to the head,
and not held too long in that situation, but
neatly and smartly discharged, without any
hanging upon the string. Among the requisites
necessary to constitute a good archer,
are a clear sight, steadily directed to the
mark, and proper judgment to determine the
distance of the ground; he ought also to
know how to take the advantage of a side-wind,
and to be well acquainted with what
compass his arrows would require in their
flight: courage is also an indispensable requisite,
for whoever, says our author, shoots
with the least trepidation, he is sure to shoot
badly. One great fault in particular he complains
of, which young archers generally fall
into, and that is, the direction of the eye to
the end of the arrow, rather than to the
mark; to obviate this evil habit, he advises
such as were so accustomed, to shoot in the
dark, by night, at lights set up at a proper
distance for that purpose. He then concludes
with observing, that “bad tutorage” was
rarely amended in grown-up persons; and
therefore he held it essentially necessary that
great attention should be paid to the teaching
of an archer properly, while he was young;
“for children,” says he, “if sufficient pains
are taken with them at the onset, may much
more easily be taught to shoot well, than
men,” because the latter have frequently
more trouble to unlearn their bad habits,
than was primitively requisite to learn them
good ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kings and princes have been celebrated for
their skill in archery, and among those of our
own country may be placed King Henry VII.,
who in his youth was partial to this exercise,
and therefore it is said of him in an old poem,
written in praise of the Princess Elizabeth,
afterwards Queen to Henry VII.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He also amused himself with the bow after
he had obtained the crown, as we find from
an account of his expenditures, where the
following memorandums occur: “Lost to my
Lord Morgan at buttes, six shillings and
eightpence:” and again, “Paid to Sir Edward
Boroughes thirteen shillings and fourpence
which the kynge lost at buttes with his cross-bowe.”
Both the sons of King Henry followed
his example, and were excellent archers.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In a curious manuscript of the time of
Queen Elizabeth, is this account of an archer
and all his necessary appendages:—“Captains
and officers should be skilful of that most
noble weapon, and see that their soldiers, according
to their draft and strength, have good
bows, well notched, well strynged, and every
strynge whippe in their noche; and in the
myddes rubbed with wax, braser, and shooting
glove; some spare strynges trymed as aforesaid;
every man one shefe of arrows, with a
case of leather defensible against the rayne;
and in the same fower and twentie arrows,
whereof eight of them should be lighter than
the residue; to gall or astonye the enemye
with the hail-shot of light arrows, before they
shall come within the danger of the harquebuss
shot. Let every man have a brigandine
or a little cote of plate, a skull or huskyn, a
mawle of leade of five foote in lengthe, and a
fusee, and the same hanging by his girdle
with a hooke and a dagger; being thus furnished,
teach them by musters to marche,
shoote, and retire, keeping their faces upon
the enemy’s. Sum tyme put them into great
nowmbers, as to battle appertayneth; and
thus use them oftentimes practised, till they
be perfecte; for those men in battel or skirmish
cannot be spared. No other weapon
maye compare with the same noble weapon.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The Royal Company of Scotland, one of the
most ancient associations in the empire, is said
to owe its origin to the commissioners who
were originally appointed by James I., to superintend
and regulate the exercise of archery
throughout the kingdom. These commissioners,
who were generally people of character and respectability,
picked out among the number of
men under their superintendence, the most expert
archers; and, in cases of emergency, made a
present of their services to the government, in
order that they might form the king’s bodyguard.
While in this situation, they gave repeated
instances of their courage and dexterity.
Within seven miles of Edinburgh, the royal
company still claims the rank of the King’s
Chief Body Guards. In the year 1677, this
company was known under the name and
title of His Majesty’s Company of Archers;
and in the same year, and by the same act of
the privy council, a piece of plate of the value
of twenty pounds was shot for at the annual
parades of the company, called Weapon-shawings;
this plate was denominated the “King’s
Prize.” At the period to which we are at
present alluding, the Royal Company consisted
of the principal nobility of Scotland. But
the revolutionary principles to which they so
tenaciously adhered, almost annihilated their
consequence, and withheld the continuance of
the King’s prize. Their original magnificence
was, however, revived on the accession of
Queen Anne to the throne; but their attachment
to the unfortunate and ill-fated house
of Stuart, again proved the declension of their
splendour. But these differences, by the annihilation
of the family to whom they are
attached, have now subsided, and they are
now reinstated in all their former consequence.
In 1788 the annual prize was revived
and shot for, in the presence of a numerous
body of spectators. We may here observe,
that the three principal bodies of archers in
England and Scotland, are now incorporated
in one; by the union of the Woodmen of
Arden, the Toxopholites, and the Royal Society
of Archers. The prizes, which properly
belong to the latter, and which are annually
shot for, are, first, a silver arrow, which was
presented by the town of Musselburgh, which
seems to have been shot for as far back as
the year 1603. Whoever gains this may take
charge of it for a year; at the expiration of
which period it is returned with any device
that his imagination may suggest. Second,
a silver arrow, which, in A. D. 1626, was
granted by the town of Peebles. Third, a
silver arrow, given by the town of Edinburgh,
A. D. 1709. Fourth, a silver punch-bowl,
about the value of fifty pounds, made at the
expense of the company of Scotch silversmiths.
Fifth, the king’s prize, which is the entire
property of the winner. These prizes are
shot for at what is called rovers: the marks
are placed at the distance of one hundred and
eighty-five yards. The uniform of the Royal
Company of Archers is tartan, lined with
white, and trimmed with green and white
fringes; a white sash with green tassels, and
a blue bonnet with St. Andrew’s feather and
cross. They have also two standards; on one
of which is inscribed, “Nemo me impune
lacessit;” on the other, “Dulce pro patria
periculum.”—<i>Ascham</i>—<i>Strutt</i>—<i>Ency.

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Arm</span>, <i>s.</i> The limb which reaches from the hand to the shoulder; the large

<p class='c006'>“There are three essential parts in the
composition of the arrow,” says Ascham, “the
stele or wand, the feathers, and the head.
The stele was not always made with the same
species of wood, but varied as occasion required,
to suit the different manners of shooting
practised by the archers;” he commends
sound ash for military arrows, and preferred
it to asp, which in his day was generally used
for arrows belonging to the army; but for
pastime, he thought that none were better
than those made of oak, hardbeam, or birch;
“but after all,” says he, “in this point I hold
it best to trust to the recommendation of an
honest fletcher.” The feathers from the wing
of a goose, and especially of a grey goose, he
thought were preferable to any others for the
pluming of an arrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>English arrows then had forked heads and
broad heads, but round pointed heads resembling
a bodkin were reckoned better. The
notch, or small hollow part at the bottom of
the arrow, made for the reception of the
bow-string, was varied as occasion required,
or at the will of the archer, being sometimes
deep and narrow, and sometimes broad and
not deep.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>An arrow, weighing from twenty to twenty-four
pennyweights, made of yew, was
considered by archers to be the best that
could be made. The feathers of a goose
should be used; and the bird from which
they are taken should be two or three years
of age. In an arrow, it is remarkable that
two out of three feathers are commonly
white, as they are plucked from the gander;
but the third is usually brown or grey, being
taken from the goose; and this difference of
colour shows the archer when the arrow is
properly placed. The expression of the “grey
goose’s wing,” in the old ballad of Chevy
Chase, is an allusion to this occurrence; originally,
arrows were armed with flint or metal
heads; latterly with iron of different forms
and names. Henry IV. ordained that all
arrows should be well boiled or brased, and
hardened at the points with steel. Arrows
were usually reckoned by sheaves; a sheaf
consisting of twenty-four arrows. They were
carried in a quiver, called an arrow case,
which served for the magazine. In ancient
times, different species of combustible materials
were attached to the heads of arrows,
and shot from long bows; and even subsequently
to the invention of gunpowder this
mode has been carried into execution. According
to Neade, an archer may shoot an
ounce of fireworks from an arrow twelve
score yards. Among the stores at Berwick
and Newhaven, in the reign of Edward VI.,
arrows with wildfire are enumerated. Some
slight opinion of the strength of an arrow in
its full flight, may be formed from the account
given by Edward VI. in his journal:
he observes, that one hundred archers shot
arrows each before him, and afterwards altogether;
that they shot at an inch board: some
pierced it through and stuck in the other
board, and others pierced it through with the
heads of their arrows.—<i>Ascham</i>—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Asinine</span>, <i>a.</i> Belonging to an ass.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ass</span>, <i>s.</i> An animal of burden.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal, though now so common in all
parts of these islands, was entirely lost among
us during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, for
Hollingshed informs us, that in his time “our
lande did yield no asses.” Yet we are not to
suppose that so useful an animal was unknown
here before that period; in fact, mention is
made of them as early as the time of King
Ethelred, above five hundred years preceding,
and again in the reign of Henry III., so that
it must have been owing to some accident
that the race was extinct during the reign of
Elizabeth. We are not certain as to the time
it was again introduced, probably in the succeeding
reign, when our intercourse with
Spain was renewed, in which country this
animal was greatly used.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their constitution is so hardy, that even in
the depth of winter, the most wretched hovel
is sufficient for them from the cold; and so
temperate are they with respect to food, that
they can subsist on such vegetables as almost
any other animal would refuse to eat. The
thistle and plantain, which generally grow in
abundance on waste lands and along the sides
of roads, afford them a sufficient feast after
their day of toil is concluded.</p>

<p class='c006'>When young they are sprightly, handsome,
light, and even graceful; but they soon lose
those qualities, either from age or bad treatment,
and become slow, stubborn, and headstrong.
The ass is strongly attached to his
master, notwithstanding he is usually ill-treated;
he will scent him at a great distance,
and distinguish him from any other person.
Of all the animals covered with hair he is
the least subject to vermin, which apparently
proceeds from the peculiar hardness and dryness
of the skin; and for the same reason he
is less sensible than the horse to the whip,
and to the stinging of flies.</p>

<p class='c006'>The milk of the ass is the lightest of all
milks, and is recommended by medical men
to persons of delicate stomachs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The age of the ass is equal to that of the
horse, and even in some instances, exceeds it.
One which died in 1782 had been employed
in turning the water-wheel at a deep well in
Carisbrook Castle for forty years.</p>

<p class='c006'>By far the largest breed of asses at this
time known in the world is in Spain; they
are large, strong, elegant, and stately animals,
often fifteen hands or more in height. The
best of this breed sell there at very high
prices, sometimes for as much as a hundred
guineas each, and upwards. In other countries
of Europe the ass is nearly as much
neglected as it is in Great Britain. In Sardinia
there is a race of asses that are very
little larger than dogs; they seldom exceed
two feet in height, and are in all respects proportionately
small.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the skin of the ass is very hard, and
very elastic, it is used for different purposes,
such as to make drums, shoes, and thick
parchment for pocket-books, which latter is
slightly varnished over. It is also of ass’s
skin that the orientals make their sagri, or, as
we call it, shagreen. Probably, too, the bones
of asses are harder than those of other animals,
since the ancients made their best-sounding
flutes of them. In proportion to
his size, the ass can carry a greater weight
than any other animal; he sleeps much less
than the horse, and never lies down for that
purpose, unless very much tired.—<i>Le Keux.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Asthma</span>, <i>s.</i> A frequent, difficult, and short respiration, joined with a
hissing sound and a cough.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Asthma in Dogs.</span></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Canine Asthma</i> is hardly ever observed
to attack any but old dogs, or those
who, by confinement, too full living, and
want of exercise, may be supposed to have
become diseased by these deviations from a
state of nature. It is hardly possible to keep
a dog very fat, for any great length of time,
without bringing it on. This cough is frequently
confounded with the cough that precedes
and accompanies distemper; but it may
be readily distinguished from this, by an
attention to circumstances—as the age of the
animal, its not affecting the general health,
nor producing immediate emaciation, and its
less readily giving way to medicine. The
cure is often very difficult, because the disease
has in general been long neglected before
it is sufficiently noticed by the owners. As
it is in general brought on by confinement,
too much warmth, and over-feeding, so it is
evident the cure must be begun by a steady
persevering alteration in these particulars.
The medicines most useful are alteratives,
and of those, occasionally, emetics are the
best. One grain of tartarised antimony (<i>i. e.</i>
tartar emetic), with two, three, or four grains of
calomel, is a very useful and valuable emetic.
This dose is sufficient for a small dog, and
may be repeated twice a week with great
success—always with palliation.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It derives its origin from the artificial mode
of life forced on pet and fancy dogs, whose
close confinement and over-feeding lead to
an extraordinary accumulation of fat: and according
to the degree in which these predisposing
causes have been applied, the disease
appears earlier or later in life. In some it
comes on at three or four years old: in others,
rather less artificially treated, it may not appear
until seven or eight.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases, the irritation of the cough,
and the accompanying hectic, emaciates and
wears down the animal: in others, the pulmonary
congestion stops respiration, and kills
by a sudden suffocation; or the obstruction
the blood meets with in its passage through
the heart, occasions accumulation in the head,
and convulsive fits are the precursors of death.
Now and then a rupture of the heart, or of
some large blood-vessel, suddenly destroys:
but by far the most common termination of
the complaint is in dropsy, or serous collections
within the chest or belly, or both, but
most frequently of the latter. In these cases,
the limbs and external parts of the body
waste, but the belly increases in its size; the
legs also swell; the hair stares; the breathing
becomes very laborious; and, in the end,
suffocation ensues.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the various remedial plans I have pursued,
none have appeared more uniformly
beneficial than a course of emetics, steadily
persisted in twice a week. In the intermediate
days <i>alteratives</i> were administered, with
the occasional use of a purgative, provided the
dog was strong, fat, and plethoric; otherwise
this was dispensed with: but it should be remembered,
that this remedial plan must be
uniformly and long continued, to ensure permanent
benefit. The alterative is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be given either as a powder, or it
may be made into a ball with honey; this

to the urgency of the case: the quantities
may be also lessened or increased according
to the effect produced; the recipe is
intended for a dog of middling size. On the
morning that the emetic is given, the alterative
should be omitted; and where the alterative
is repeated night and morning, it will be
prudent to watch the mouth, that salivation
may not unexpectedly come on. If this
should happen, discontinue the medicine for
some days. Where also the calomel has been
found to disagree, I have substituted the following
alterative with benefit:—</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be given as the other, and alternated
with the emetic also, watching the
effect of the foxglove, through the medium of
the pulse, that they may not be too violent.
In some cases of long standing, where the
attendant cough has been very harsh, noisy,
and distressing, I have added ten, twenty, or
thirty drops of tincture of opium (<i>laudanum</i>),
or the eighth, sixth, or fourth part of a grain
of opium, to each alterative with advantage.
In other instances, the cough has been best
allayed by an evening opiate of double the
strength before prescribed. I have, now and
then, experienced benefit also from the use
of the balsamic gums, which may be all tried,
therefore, in obstinate cases. Relief has been
obtained likewise from the following, given

<p class='c006'>This species appears to have become extremely
rare on the north coast of Britain. The natives
in the Orkneys informed Mr. Bullock, in his
late tour through those islands, that one male
only had made his appearance for a long time,
which had regularly visited Papa Westra for
several years. The female (which the natives
call the Queen of the Auks) was killed
just before Mr. Bullock’s arrival. The King,
or male, Mr. Bullock had the pleasure of
chasing for several hours, in a six-oared boat,
but without being able to kill him, for though
he frequently got near him, so expert was the
bird in its natural element, that it appeared
impossible to shoot him. The rapidity with
which he pursued his course under water was
almost incredible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The length is three feet. The bill is
black, very strong, compressed, and marked
with several furrows. The base of the upper
mandible is covered with short velvet-like
feathers; between the bill and the eye is a
large patch of white; the head, neck, back,
and wings, glossy black; lesser quill-feathers
tipped with white; legs black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smallness of the wings renders them
useless for flight, the longest quill-feather not
exceeding four inches in length. These, however,
are admirably adapted to its mode of
life, and are of peculiar use in diving under
water, where they act as fins; by which
means it pursues its prey with astonishing
velocity.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is only found in the most northern
parts of the kingdom; it is said to breed
in the isle of St. Kilda, from which Dr. Fleming
had one in 1822. Like the rest of this
genus it lays only one egg, white, sometimes
irregularly marked with purplish lines, or
blotched with ferruginous and black at the
larger end: length six inches. It feeds on
fish, but the young birds will eat rose root
(<i>Rhodiola rosea</i>), or other plants.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This bird, which is the only British species
of Avosets, does not much exceed the lapwing
in the bulk of its body; but from the length
of its legs it is much taller. It measures
about eighteen inches in length, to the end of
the toes twenty-two, and from tip to tip thirty;
and weighs from twelve to fourteen ounces.
The bill is black, about three inches and a
half long, and of a singular conformation;
looking not unlike flexible flat pieces of
whalebone, curved upwards to the tip: the
irides are hazel; the head round, black on
the upper part to below the nape of the neck:
above and beneath each eye, in most specimens,
there are small white spots; but in the
one from which the above figure was taken,
a streak of that colour passed over each eye
towards the hinder part of the head. The
thighs are naked, and, as well as the legs
and feet, are of a fine pale blue colour.
The whole plumage of the Avoset is white,
intersected with black; and, like most of the
variegated or piebald birds, the patches of
these colours are not placed exactly the same
in every individual; therefore, as the bird
cannot be mistaken, a more minute description
is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are common in the winter
about the lakes, mouths of rivers, and marshes,
in the southern parts of England; and they
assemble in large flocks on the fens, in the
breeding season. When the female is frightened
off her nest she counterfeits lameness;
and when a flock is disturbed they fly with
their necks stretched out, and their legs extended
behind over the head of the spectator,
much in the same way as the peewit or lapwing,
making a shrill noise, and uttering a
yelping cry of twit, twit, all the time. The
places where they have been feeding may be
traced out by the semicircular marks left in
the mud or sand by their bills, in scooping
out their food, which consists of spawn, worms,
insects, &amp;c. Latham says, “They lay two
eggs, the size of those of a pigeon, an inch and
three quarters in length, of a cinereous grey,
singularly marked with deep brownish dark
patches, of irregular sizes and shapes, besides
some under markings of a dusky hue.” They
keep near the shore, wading about, up to the

<p class='c006'>The Scooper is the only species found in
England. It breeds in the fens of Lincolnshire,
and on Romney Marsh in Kent. It
does not migrate, like other birds of similar
habits, but is found at all seasons, though in
winter it chiefly frequents the sea-shore; and,
besides on the coast of Kent, it is found about
the mouth of the Severn, in Gloucestershire,
as well as on the eastern coasts of Norfolk
and Suffolk, and sometimes in Shropshire.
During the breeding season, the Avosets are
seen in considerable numbers near Fossdike,
in Lincolnshire, and also in the fens of Cambridgeshire,
and similar localities. Temminck
says it is common in North Holland.
It seems, indeed, to be very widely diffused,
being found in Denmark, Sweden, Russia,
Siberia, the Caspian Sea, and particularly
about the Salt Lakes in the deserts of Tartary.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Latham</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>game of tables</i> is better known at present
by the name of Backgammon. This pastime
is said to have been discovered about the
tenth century, and the name derived from two
Welsh words signifying “little battle.” But
the derivation may be found nearer home. The
words are perfectly Saxon, as Bac, or Bæc, and
Zamen, that is, Back Game; so denominated
because the performance consists in the players
bringing their men back from their antagonist’s
tables into their own; or because
the pieces are sometimes taken up and obliged
to go back, that is, re-enter at the table they
came from.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most material circumstances in which
the game differed, at this remote period, from
the present method of playing it, was, first, in
having three dice instead of two, or reckoning
a certain number for the third; and secondly,
in placing all the men within the antagonist’s
table, which, says an ancient writer, must be
put upon his ace point. There is also another
game upon the tables, called Paume Carie,
which is played with two dice, and requires
four players, that is, two on either side; or six,
and then three are opposed to three. The
same authority then speaks of a third game,
called Ludus Lombardorum, the Game of
Lombardy, and thus played: he who sits on
the side marked 13—24 has his men at 6,
and his antagonist has his men at 19; which
is changing the ace point in the English game
for the size point: and this alteration probably
shortened the game. He mentions
the five following variations by name only;
the Imperial game, the Provincial game, the
games called Baralie, Mylys, and Faylis.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the commencement of the last century,
backgammon was a very favourite amusement,
and pursued at leisure times by most persons
of opulence, and especially by the clergy;
which occasioned Dean Swift, when writing
to a friend of his in the country, sarcastically
to ask the following question: “In what
esteem are you with the vicar of the parish:
can you play with him at backgammon?”
But of late years this pastime is become unfashionable,
and of course not so much practised.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>This game is played with dice upon a table
by two persons, upon which there are twenty-four
black and white spaces, called points.
Each adversary has fifteen men, black and
white, to distinguish them, and they are disposed
of in the following manner. Supposing
the game to be played into the right hand
table, two are placed upon the ace point in the
adversary’s table, five upon the six point in
the opposite table, three upon the cinque
point in the hithermost table, and five on the
sixth point in the right hand table. The
grand object in this game is for each player to
bring the men round into his right hand table,
by throwing with a pair of dice those throws
that contribute towards it, and at the same
time prevent the adversary doing the like.
The first best throw upon the dice is esteemed
aces, because it stops the six point in the outer
table, and secures the cinque in the thrower’s
table, whereby the adversary’s two men upon
the thrower’s ace point cannot get out with
either quatre, cinque, or six. This throw is
an advantage often given to the antagonist by
the superior player. When he carries his
men home in order to lose no point, he is to
carry the most distant man to his adversary’s
bar point, that being the first stage he is to
place it on; the next stage is six points farther,
viz. in the place where the adversary’s
five men are first placed out of his tables.
He must go on this method till all his men
are brought home, except two, when, by losing
a point, he may often save the gammon, by
throwing two fours or two fives. When a hit
is only played for, he should endeavour to
gain either his own or adversary’s cinque
point, and if that fails by his being hit by the
adversary, and he finds him forwarder than
himself, in that case he must throw more men
into the adversary’s tables, which is done in
this manner: he must put a man upon his
cinque or bar point, and if the adversary fails
to hit it, he may then gain a forward game
instead of a back game; but if the adversary
hit him, he should play for a back game, and
then the greater number of men which are
taken up makes his game the better, because
by these means he will preserve his game at
home, and then he should endeavour to gain
both his adversary’s ace and trois points, and
take care to keep three men upon the adversary’s
ace point, that, in case he hits him from
thence, that point may remain still secure to
himself. A back game should not be played
for at the beginning of a set, because it would
be a great disadvantage, the player running
the risk of a gammon to win a single hit.</p>

<p class='c006'>A variety of instructions with regard to this
curious game are given by Mr. Hoyle, who
calculates the odds of the game with great
accuracy. The following particulars, however,
may be of use to the generality of players. If
a player has taken up two of the adversary’s
men, and happens to have two, three, or more
points made in his own tables, he should
spread his own men, that he may either take
a new point in his tables, or be ready to hit
the man which the adversary may happen to
enter. If he finds upon the adversary’s entering,
that the game is upon a par, or that the
advantage is on his own side, he should take
the adversary’s man up whenever he can, it
being twenty-five to eleven that he is not hit,
except when he is playing for a single hit only,
then, if playing, the throw otherwise gives him
a better chance for it, he ought to do it. As
it is five to one against his being hit with
double dice, he should never be deterred from
taking up any one man of the adversary’s. If
he has taken up one of the adversary’s men,
and should happen to have five points in his
own tables, and forced to leave a blot out of
his tables, he should endeavour to leave it
upon doublets preferable to any other chance;
because the odds are thirty-five to one that he
is not hit, whereas it is only seventeen to one
but he is hit upon another chance. When
the adversary is very forward, a player should
never move a man from his own quatre,
trois, or deuce points, thinking to bear that
man from the point where he put it, as
nothing but high doublets can give him any
chance for the hit. Instead of playing an ace
or a deuce from any of these points, he should
play them from his own size or highest points,
so that throwing two fives or two fours, his
size and cinque points being eased, would be a
considerable advantage to him, whereas, had
they been loaded, he must have been obliged
to play otherwise. It is the interest of the
adversary to take up the player as soon as he
enters. The blot should be left on the adversary’s
lowest point, that is to say, upon his
deuce point, rather than upon his trois point, or
upon his trois point rather than upon his quatre
point, or upon his quatre point preferable to
his cinque point, for a reason before-mentioned;
all the men the adversary plays upon his trois
or his deuce points are deemed lost, being
greatly out of play, so that those men not
having it in their power to make his cinque
point, and his game being crowded in on one
point, and open in another, the adversary
must be greatly annoyed by the player. If
the player has two of his adversary’s men in
his tables, he has a better chance for a hit
than if he had more, provided his game is
forwarder than that of his antagonist, for if he
had three or more of his adversary’s men
in his tables, he would stand a worse chance
to be hit. When a player is running to save
the gammon, if he should have two men upon
his ace point, and several men abroad, although
he should lose one point or two in his putting
his men into his tables, it is his interest to
leave a man upon his adversary’s ace point,
because it will prevent his adversary from
bearing his men to the best advantage, and at
the same time the player will have a chance
of the adversary’s making a blot which he
may chance to hit. However, if a player
finds, upon a throw, that he has a probability
of saving his gammon, he should never wait
for a blot, as the odds are greatly against his
hitting it, but should embrace that opportunity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are directions for calculating
the odds of saving or winning the gammon:—Suppose
the adversary has so many men
abroad as require three throws to bring them
into his tables, and at the same time that the
players’ tables are made up, and that he has
taken up one of the adversary’s men, in this
case it is about an equal wager that the adversary
is gammoned. For, in all probability,
the player has borne two men before he opens
his tables, and when he bears the third man,
he will be obliged to open his size or cinque
point. It is then probable, that the adversary
is obliged to throw twice before he enters
his men in the player’s tables, twice before he
puts that man into his own tables, and three
throws more to put the men which are abroad
into his own tables, in all seven throws.
Now the player having twelve men to bear,
he may be forced to make an ace or a deuce
twice before he can bear all his men, and
consequently will require seven throws in
bearing them; so that, upon the whole, it is
about equal whether the adversary is gammoned
or not. Suppose a player has three
men upon his adversary’s ace point, and
five points on his own tables, and that the
adversary has all his men in his tables, three
upon each of his five highest points, has the
player a probability of gammoning his adversary
or not?</p>

<p class='c006'>So that the odds are twenty-five to eleven
against hitting either of these blots.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method may be taken to find out the
odds of hitting three, four, or five blots upon
double dice, or blots made upon double or
single dice at the same time. After knowing
how many chances there are to hit any of
those blots, they must be added together, and
then subtracted from the number thirty-six,
which are the chances of the two dices, and the
question is solved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laws of backgammon are, first, If a
man is taken from any point, it must be played,
if two men are taken from it they also must
be played. Second, A man is not supposed to
be played till it is placed upon a point and
quitted. Third, If a player has only fourteen
men in play, there is no penalty inflicted; because
by his playing with a less number than
he is entitled to, he plays to a disadvantage
for want of the deficient man to make up his
tables. Fourth, If he bears any number of
men before he has entered a man taken up,
and which of course he was obliged to enter,
such men so borne must be entered again in
the adversary’s tables, as well as the man
taken up. Fifth, If he has mistaken his
throw and played it, and his adversary has
thrown, it is not in the choice of either of the
players to alter it, unless they both agree so
to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>The probable method of prolonging a hit
at backgammon, affords a case of instruction
as well as curiosity; for there is a probability
of making the hit last by one of the players
for many hours, although they shall both
play as fast as usual. Suppose B to have
borne thirteen men, and that A has his
fifteen men in B’s tables, viz. three men upon
his size point, as many upon his cinque, quatre,
and trois points, two upon his deuce
point, and one upon his ace point. A in this
situation can prolong it by bringing his fifteen
men home, always securing six close points
till B has entered his two men, and brought
them upon any certain point; as soon as B
has gained that point A will open an ace,
deuce, or trois point, or all of them, which
done, B hits one of them, and A taking care
to have two or three men in B’s tables, is
ready to hit that man, and also he being certain
of taking up the other man, has it in his
power to prolong the hit almost to any length,
provided he takes care not to open such points
as two fours, two fives, or two sixes, but
always to open the ace, deuce, or trois points,
for B to hit him. We add the following two
critical cases for a back game. First, suppose
the fore game to be played by A, and
that all his men are placed as usual, B has
fourteen of his men placed upon his adversary’s
ace point, and one man upon his adversary’s
deuce point, and B is to throw who has
the best of the hit; answer, A has the best of
it, gold to silver, because, if B does not throw
an ace to take his adversary’s deuce point,
which is twenty-five to eleven against him, A
will take up B’s men in his tables either singly
or make points, and then if B secures
either A’s deuce or trois point, A will put as
many men down as possible, in order to hit
and thereby get a back game. It is evident
that the back game is powerful, consequently,
whoever practises it must become a greater
proficient at the game than he could by any
other means. Second, Suppose A to have five
men placed upon his size point, as many upon
his quatre point, and the same number upon
his deuce point, all in his own tables. At
the same time let us suppose B to have three
men placed upon A’s ace point, as many upon
A’s trois point, and the same number upon
A’s cinque point, in his own tables, and three
men placed as usual out of his tables, who has
the best of the hit? Answer—The game is
equal till B has gained his cinque and quatre
points in his own tables, which, if he can
effect, and by playing two men from A’s cinque
point, in order to force his adversary to blot
by throwing a cane, which should B hit, he
will have the best of the hit.—<i>Strutt</i>—<i>Ency.

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE BADGER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The usual length of the badger is two feet
six inches, exclusive of the tail, which is barely
six inches long, and covered with long hair, the
same as those of the body; the weight from
fifteen to thirty-four pounds—the last is rare,
but in the winter of 1779, Mr. Pennant had a
male badger of that weight; the eyes are
very small, the ears short and rounded; the
neck thick, and the whole shape of the body
clumsy, and which being covered with long
coarse hairs, like bristles, adds to its awkward
appearance; each hair next the root is of a
dirty, yellowish white, the middle is black,
and the extremity grey; hence arose the old
saying, “As grey as a badger.” It has thirty-four
teeth, six cutting and two canine teeth
in each jaw—the lower and upper have each
five grinders; the nose, chin, and lower sides
of the cheeks are white; each ear and eye is
inclosed in a pyramidal bed of black, the base
of which incloses the former,—this point extends
beyond the eye to the nose; the throat
and under parts of the body are black. This
is a singularity in the badger, for all other
animals have hair of a lighter colour upon
their bellies, than upon their backs. The
legs and feet of the badger are black, very
short, and strong; each foot is divided into
five toes, those in the fore feet are armed
with long claws, well adapted for digging its
subterraneous habitation, where, although
there is but one entrance from the surface,
it forms several apartments, and in the breeding
season carries in grass in his mouth, to
form a bed for its young. It confines itself
to its hole during the day, feeding only at
night. It is so cleanly as never to obey the
calls of nature in its own burrow. It is said
the fox takes advantage of this niceness, and
uses an obvious method to make the badger’s
home unpleasant, of which he by this means
possesses himself. In walking, the badger
treads on his whole heel, like the bear, which
brings the belly very near the ground. Immediately
below the tail, between that and
the anus, there is a narrow transverse orifice,
from whence continually exudes a white substance
of a very fœtid smell: this seems
peculiar to the badger and the hyæna.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Badger-Hunting</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Few creatures defend themselves better, or
bite with greater keenness, than the badger:
on that account it is frequently baited with
dogs trained for that purpose, and defends itself
from their attacks with astonishing agility and
success. Its motions are so quick, that a dog is
often desperately wounded in the moment of
assault, and obliged to fly. The thickness of the
badger’s skin, and the length and coarseness of
its hair, are an excellent defence against the
bites of the dogs; its skin is so loose as to
resist the impression of their teeth, and gives
the animal an opportunity of turning itself
round, and wounding its adversaries in their
tenderest parts. In this manner this singular
creature is able to resist repeated attacks both
of men and dogs, from all quarters, till, being
overpowered with numbers, and enfeebled by
many desperate wounds, it is at last obliged to
yield.</p>

<p class='c006'>In hunting the badger, you must seek the
earths and burrows where he lies, and, in a
clear moonlight night, go and stop all the
burrows except one or two, and therein place
some sacks, fastened with drawing strings,
which may shut him in as soon as he strains
the bag. Some only place a hoop in the
mouth of the sack, and so put it into the hole;
and as soon as the badger is in the sack, and
strains it, the sack slips from the hoop, and
secures him in it, where he lies trembling till
he is taken from his prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sacks or bags being thus set, cast off
the hounds, beating about all the woods,
hedges, and tufts round about, for the compass
of a mile or two, and what badgers are
abroad, being alarmed by the hounds, will
soon betake themselves to their burrows.
Observe that the person who is placed to
watch the sacks, must stand close, and upon
a clear wind, otherwise the badger will discover
him, and immediately fly some other
way into his burrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if the dogs can encounter him before he
can take his sanctuary, he will then stand at
bay like a boar, and make good sport, vigorously
biting and clawing the dogs. In general, when
they fight, they lie on their backs, using both
teeth and nails; and, by blowing up their skins,
defend themselves against the bites of the dogs
and the blows given by the men. When the
badger finds that the terriers yearn him in
his burrow, he will stop the hole between him
and the terriers; and if they still continue
baying, he will remove his couch into another
chamber or part of the burrow, and so from
one to another, barricading the way before
them as he retreats, till he can go no farther.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you intend to dig the badger out of his
burrow, you must be provided with such tools
as are used for digging out a fox: you should
also have a pail of water ready to refresh the
terriers when they come out of the earth
to take breath and cool themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is no unusual thing to put some small
bells about the necks of the terriers, which,
making a noise, will cause the badger to bolt
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>In digging, the situation of the ground must
be observed and considered; or instead of
advancing the work, you probably may hinder
it. In this order you may besiege them in
their holds, or castles, and break their platforms,
parapets, and casemates, and work to
them with mines and countermines, till you
have overcome them.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must do this animal the justice to
observe, that, though nature has furnished it
with formidable weapons of offence, and has
besides given it strength sufficient to use
them with great effect, it is, notwithstanding,
very harmless and inoffensive, and, unless
attacked, employs them only for its support.</p>

<p class='c006'>The badger is an indolent animal, and
sleeps much: it confines itself to its hole
during the whole day, and feeds only in the
night. It is so cleanly as never to defile its
habitation with its ordure. Immediately below
the tail, between that and the anus, there
is a narrow transverse orifice, from whence a
white substance, of a very fœtid smell, constantly
exudes. The skin, when dressed
with the hair on, is used for pistol furniture.
Its flesh is eaten: the hind quarters are sometimes
made into hams, which, when cured,
are not inferior in goodness to the best bacon.
The hairs are made into brushes, which are
used by painters to soften and harmonise
their shades.</p>

<p class='c006'>In walking, the badger treads on its whole
heel, like the bear, which brings its belly
very near the ground.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Extraordinary Affection in the Badger.</i>—Two
persons were on a short journey, and
passing through a hollow way, a dog which
was with them, started a badger, which he
attacked, and pursued, till he took shelter in
a burrow under a tree. With some pains
they hunted him out, and killed him. Being
a very few miles from a village, called Chapellatiere,
they agreed to drag him there, as
the commune gave a reward for every one
which was destroyed; besides, they purposed
selling the skin. Not having a rope, they
twisted some twigs, and drew him along the
road by turns. They had not proceeded
far, when they heard a cry of an animal
in seeming distress, and stopping to see
from whence it proceeded, another badger
approached them slowly. They at first threw
stones at it, notwithstanding which it drew
near, came up to the dead animal, began to
lick it, and continued its mournful cry. The
men, surprised at this, desisted from offering
any further injury to it, and again drew the
dead one along as before; when the living
badger, determining not to quit its dead companion,
lay down on it, taking it gently by one
ear, and in that manner was drawn into the
midst of the village; nor could dogs, boys, or
men, induce it to quit its situation by any
means, and, to their shame be it said, they
had the inhumanity to kill it, and afterwards
to burn it, declaring it could be no other than
a witch.—<i>Buffon</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ball</span>, <i>s.</i> Anything made in a round form; a round thing to play with,
a hand-ball, a billiard-ball.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balls</i> (<i>in farriery</i>) are boluses given to
horses, and should not exceed in size a hen’s egg.
Though named balls, they are generally rolled
up in a cylindrical form, about one inch in diameter,
and two and a half in length; but the form
of an egg is preferable. There is sometimes
difficulty in giving balls, without using a balling
iron; and there are horses that will not
take a ball by any other means. In giving
it, the horse’s tongue is drawn out on the off
or right side, and held firmly with the left
hand, while with the right the ball is passed
over the tongue into the pharynx, or top of
the gullet. The hand should be kept as near
to the roof of the mouth as possible; there
will then be much less danger of being
wounded by the teeth. The moment the
right hand is withdrawn from the mouth, the
tongue is let loose, and the ball generally
swallowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Balls should be made at the time they are
wanted; as by keeping they become so hard
as to be insoluble in the stomach, and pass
through the intestines unchanged. By keeping
they also lose much of their strength,
particularly when the ingredients are evaporable
in the common temperature of the atmosphere,
which is the case with camphor, ammonia,
essential oils, &amp;c. But the most
serious inconvenience which arises from giving
balls that have been kept until they become
very hard, is, that they are liable to stick in
the throat or gullet, and thereby endanger
the horse’s life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Balls cannot be conveniently given unless
wrapped up in paper: but for this purpose
the softest and thinnest should be chosen.</p>

<p class='c006'>In holding the tongue with the left hand
while the ball is introduced, great care is
required, as the rough and violent manner in
which this is sometimes done, injures the
tongue or lacerates the under part of it, named
the bridle. The muscles by which swallowing
is effected may also be seriously injured
in this way. In violent colds, strangles, &amp;c.
there is so much soreness of the throat as to
render swallowing very painful and difficult;
in such cases neither balls nor drenches should
be given, as they are sure to do mischief by
irritating the throat, and may even suffocate
the animal by getting into the wind-pipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a ball is found to exceed the proper
size, it should be divided and given at twice,
as much injury has been done by giving balls
too large, especially when they have become
dry and hard, or been wrapped in thick paper.
In making balls, the dry ingredients should
be finely powdered and well mixed, and the
liquid for forming them should be adapted to
the nature of the other ingredients. When a
ball contains any acrid, or very powerful ingredient,
such as sublimate or arsenic, flour
and paste may be employed for mixing it up,
and a small bran mash should be given a little
before or after it. After giving a ball, grooms
sometimes press or pinch the throat for the
purpose of making the horse swallow it; but
this should never be done, as it is apt to excite
coughing, by which swallowing is prevented.
The only thing necessary after the
hand is withdrawn is to keep the mouth shut,
and press the nose downwards, in a moderate
degree, towards the chest.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Balling-Iron</span>, <i>s.</i> An instrument used in administering balls to horses.
It is intended to keep the mouth open while the ball is being introduced,
and answers the double purpose of assisting the groom in the operation,
and saving his hand from injury from the horse’s teeth. In its use, it
should be carefully covered with cloth, to prevent the tongue of the
animal from being lacerated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Balm</span>, <i>s.</i> The sap or juice of a shrub, remarkably odoriferous, and of healing
qualities; any valuable or fragrant ointment; anything that soothes or
mitigates pain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Balsam</span>, <i>s.</i> A thick fluid soluble in spirit of wine.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsams</i> are a kind of resinous juice,
united with some of the extractive matter of
the various plants they are obtained from, in
combination with an essential oil. All the
balsams are occasionally in use in veterinary
medicine, and were formerly in very high
estimation, for their supposed salutary action
in chronic diseases of the lungs. They were
also considered as a sovereign vulnerary for
abraded urinary passages. It is the modern
doctrine to think their efficacy overrated, and
which is probably in some respects true, particularly
as regards their expectorant qualities:
nevertheless they are far from being
inert; on the contrary, they appear to act
favourably in some instances, as a warm terebinthinated
stimulant. The principal balsams
dispensed in veterinary practice are these:—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Canada.</i>—A strong diuretic,
used in chronic cough and diseases of the
lungs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Copaiba</i>, or <i>Capivi</i>.—Possesses
similar properties to that of Canada.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Friars.</i>—Now called <i>Tincture
of Benjamin</i>, an excellent traumatic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Gilead.</i>—Similar in its properties
to Copaiba.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Peru.</i>—A stimulant; used
externally to irritable ulcers.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Tolu.</i>—Same properties and
uses as <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Balsam of Sulphur.</i>—An expectorant;
in inflammatory coughs, however, its use is
dangerous.—<i>Outlines of Vet. Art.</i>—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Balsamic</span>, <i>a.</i> Unctuous, mitigating.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This variety is lighter, smaller, and more
active than the mastiff, from which he is
descended by a cross with the foxhound. He
is not near so powerful a dog as the former,
but is more fierce in his natural disposition.
From his descent, he possesses a finer sense
of smelling than that dog. His hair is rougher,
generally of yellowish or sandy grey, streaked
with shades of black or brown, and semi-curled
almost over his whole body; his legs,
however, are smooth. Although he generally
attacks his adversary in front, like the mastiff
and bull dog, it is not his invariable practice,
for he is sometimes seen to seize cattle by
the flank. His bite is said to be severe and
dangerous.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<i>s.</i> This is the smallest species of British Swallow; length four
inches and three quarters. The whole upper parts of the plumage are
of a mouse-coloured brown; the under parts white, except across the

irides hazel. The Bank Swallow is not near so plentiful, and is more
local than the other species.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bantam</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Bantam</i>, a well-known small breed,
originally from India, is chiefly valued for its
grotesque figure and delicate flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>There has been lately obtained a variety of
bantams, extremely small, and as smooth
legged as a game fowl. From their size and
delicacy, they are very convenient, as they
may always stand in the place of chickens,
when small ones are not otherwise to be had.
They are also particularly used for sitting
upon the eggs of partridges and pheasants,
being good nurses, as well as good layers.
Sir John Sebright, M.P. for Herts, is one of
the chief amateurs of this breed. Sir John’s
breed are beautifully striped and variegated.</p>

<p class='c006'>In addition, there is a South American

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Barbel is one of the coarsest fishes.
In England they are deemed the worst of
fresh-water fish, and seldom eaten but by the
poorest sort of people, who sometimes boil
them with a piece of bacon to give them a
relish. The roe is very noxious, affecting
those unwarily eating it with a vomiting,
purging, and a slight swelling.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Barbel takes its name from the barbs,
or wattels, at his mouth. They begin to run
up the rivers in March and April. When
they spawn, they keep together in companies,
making holes in the gravel wherein they cast
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The head of the barbel is smooth, the nostrils
are near the eyes; it has a leather
mouth, which is placed below; on each corner
is a single beard, and another on each
side of the nose; the shape is long, round,
and handsome; the dorsal fin is armed with
a remarkably strong spine, sharply serrated;
with which it can inflict a severe wound on
the uncautious handler, and do much damage
to the net. The side fin is straight; the
scales are not large, and of a pale gold
colour, edged with black; the belly white,
the tail is a little bifurcated, and of a deep
purple. It is sometimes found three feet in
length, and weighing eighteen pounds. According
to the accounts in the Elements of
Natural History, it is met with from two to
fifteen feet long, grows quickly, is very tenacious
of life, and lives to a great age.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there be any difference in the taste of
their flesh, they are most in season the latter
end of the summer; but in fact they are not
worth noticing, except for the sport the angler
derives from the catching of them, and which,
from their being so strong and determined a
fish when hooked, is very great.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Barometer.</i>—There is no instrument now
more generally used for ascertaining the coming
weather than the barometer. It may however
be remarked, that it is more from its
rising or falling, than from its height or lowness
that we are to infer fair or foul weather.
Generally speaking, the rising of the mercury
presages clear fair weather, and its falling, foul
weather; as rain, snow, high winds, and storms.</p>

<p class='c006'>In very hot weather, the falling of the
mercury indicates thunder.</p>

<p class='c006'>In winter the rising indicates frost, and in
frosty weather, if the mercury fall three or
four divisions, there will follow a thaw; but
in a continued frost, if the mercury rise, it
will snow.</p>

<p class='c006'>When foul weather happens soon after the
falling of the mercury, expect but little of it;
and, on the contrary, expect but little fair
weather when it proves fair shortly after the
mercury has risen.</p>

<p class='c006'>In foul weather, when the mercury rises
much and high, and so continues for two or
three days before the foul weather is over, then
expect a continuance of fair weather to
follow.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fair weather, when the mercury falls
much and low, and thus continues for two or
three days before the rain comes, then expect
a great deal of wet, and probably high winds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The unsettled motion of the mercury denotes
uncertain and changeable weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>The words engraved on the register plate
of the barometer, it may be observed, cannot
be strictly relied upon to correspond exactly
with the state of the weather; though it will
in general agree with them as to the mercury
rising and falling.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the thermometer and barometer rise
together in summer, with rain in large drops,
a wholesome state of the atmosphere is at hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>A great and sudden rising of the barometer,
that is to say, a great accession of atmospherical
pressure, will, in some persons, occasion a
slight temporary difficulty of hearing and tingling
in the ears, similar to that which is
experienced in descending from high mountains,
or from the air in balloons.—<i>Foster.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Barrel</span>, <i>s.</i> A round wooden vessel to be stopped close; a vessel containing
liquor; anything hollow, as the barrel of a gun; a cylinder.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Barrel-making</i> has occupied the attention
of gun manufacturers from the first invention
of fire-arms to the present time. Experiments
in the material as well as the construction
of barrels, have been extensively tried
by the artists of every country. A gradual
and progressive improvement was the result,
until the <i>slub-barrel</i> of the present day has
superseded every other kind, and seems to
have reached the utmost perfection that human
ingenuity can accomplish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The peculiar formation of barrels at different
periods, and by different artists, will be
interesting to sportsmen generally.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Spanish barrels</i> have always been held in
great esteem, as well on account of the quality
of the iron—which is generally considered the
best in Europe—as because they possess the
reputation of being forged and bored more perfectly
than any others. It should be observed,
however, that of the Spanish barrels, those
only that are made in the capital are accounted
truly valuable; in consequence of which a
great many have been made at other places,
especially in Catalonia and Biscay, with the
names and marks of the Madrid gunsmiths.
They are also counterfeited at Liege, Munich,
&amp;c.; and a person must be a good judge not
to be deceived by these spurious barrels.</p>

<p class='c006'>These barrels were formerly in such high
repute, that the price of them was enormous.
Those of Belen, Fernandez, and Bez, sold in
France for a thousand livres, or 43<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>;
while the barrels of artists of lesser name
produced three hundred, or 13<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the barrels of Madrid, those of Bustindui
and St. Olabe, at Placentia, in Biscay,
and of Jean and Clement Pedroesteva, Eudal
Pous, and Martin Marechal, at Barcelona, are
the most esteemed; these usually sell in
France for eighty French livres, or 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
sterling.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost all the barrels made at Madrid are
composed of the old shoes of horses and mules,
collected for the purpose. They are all welded
longitudinally, but instead of being forged in
one plate or piece, as in other countries, they
are made, like the English twisted barrels, in
five or six detached portions, which are afterwards
welded one to the end of another, two
of them forming the breech or reinforced part
of the barrel. We may form some idea of the
very great purity to which the iron is brought
in the course of the operation, when we are
told, that to make a barrel, which, rough from
the forge, weighs only six or seven pounds,
they employ a mass of mule-shoe iron, weighing
from forty to forty-five pounds; so that
from thirty-four to thirty-eight pounds are
lost in the heatings and hammerings it is made
to undergo before it is forged into a barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the great reputation of the
Spanish barrels, however, they are little used
in France, and still less in England, their
awkward form and their great length and
weight being strong objections to them,
especially since they have begun to make
their pieces so very light and short in these
countries; and from our own experience of
the Spanish barrels, we are convinced that
the avidity with which they are sought after
by some persons, and the extravagant prices
that are given for them, proceed more from a
fancied than from any real superiority they
possess over those made in this country.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The Spanish gunsmiths pique themselves
upon the very high polish they give to the
inside of their barrels. We have our doubts
about the advantage derived from this, and
are still of opinion that if a barrel is so smooth
as not to lead, it is better to take it as it
comes from the hand of the manufacturer,
than allow the gunsmith to practise any farther
operation upon it. In support of this opinion,
Mons. de Marolles informs us, that he has
seen a barrel rough from the borer throw a
charge of shot deeper into a quire of paper,
than another barrel that was highly polished
within, although the length, the bore, and
the charge, were the same in both.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The <i>canons a ruban</i>, or <i>riband barrels</i> of
the French, very much resemble the English
twisted barrels. The process pursued in their
formation is very troublesome, and seems to
possess no countervailing advantage. A plate
of iron about the twelfth part of an inch in
thickness is turned round a mandril, and
welded its whole length in the same manner
as a plain barrel: upon this small and light
barrel, which is called lining, a stripe or plate
of iron, about an inch in breadth, and bevelled
off at the edges, is rolled in a spiral direction,
by means of successive heats—this spiral is
termed the riband, and its thickness must
correspond with the part of the barrel it is to
constitute. As a riband of sufficient length to
cover the lining from one end to the other
would be very difficult to manage, it is formed
in several pieces, and so soon as one piece is
nearly rolled on, another is welded to the end
of it, and the operation continued until the
whole of the lining is covered. The edges
are bevelled so much, that one edge overlaps
the other about a quarter of an inch. When
the riband is all rolled on, the barrel is heated
by two or three inches at a time, and the
turns of the spiral united to each other and to
the lining, by being welded in the same manner
as a twisted or plain barrel, but requiring
more care and accuracy in the operation. It
is afterwards bored, so that almost the whole
of the lining is cut out, and scarcely anything
left except the riband with which it was
covered.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lazarini Barrels</i>, so called after the
maker, were formerly celebrated throughout
the greatest part of Europe. They were very
long, and of a very small calibre. Lazarini
lived at Brescia, about a hundred and fifty
years ago. He did not forge these barrels
himself, but he finished them with great accuracy,
and ornamented them in a rich and elegant
manner. At the time, however, when
these barrels were in high estimation, there
were numerous counterfeits bearing the name
and mark of Cominazzo, and it requires some
acquaintance with the genuine barrels not to
be deceived by the spurious ones. The true
Lazarini are now to be found only in the
repositories of the curious.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vanity of possessing something that is
singularly curious, the false idea that whatever
is expensive must necessarily be good,
and sometimes, though rarely, the laudable
desire of improvement, have all in their turns
been the causes of a variety of experiments
made in the manufacture of barrels. An artist
in London, who wrought a great deal of
Spanish iron, forged barrels from old scythes,
from wire, from needles, and a great many
other articles suggested by the whim of the
customers—who made barrels with a lining of
steel, and formed others with a double spiral of
steel and iron alternately—confessed after these
numerous trials, that “stub iron wrought into
a twisted barrel is superior to every other.”
Whenever steel was employed, he found that
the barrel neither welded nor bored so perfectly
as when iron alone was used.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The <i>English stub barrels</i> are deservedly
celebrated for their superior elegance and
strength, as well as for the accuracy with which
they throw their ball or shot. The iron employed
in them is formed of stubs, which are
old horse-shoe nails, procured from country
farriers, and from poor people who gain a subsistence
by picking them up on the great roads
leading to the metropolis. These are originally
formed from the softest, toughest iron
that can be had, and this is still farther purified
by the numerous heatings and hammerings
it has undergone in being reduced from a bar
into the size and form of nails. They cost
about ten shillings the hundred weight, and
twenty-eight pounds are required to make a
single barrel of the ordinary size. A hoop
of iron about an inch broad, or six or seven
inches diameter, is placed perpendicularly,
and the stubs, previously freed from dirt by
washing, are neatly piled in it, with their heads
outermost on each side, until the hoop is quite
filled and wedged tight with them, the whole
resembling a rough circular cake of iron. This
is put into the fire, until it has acquired a
white heat, when it is hammered either by the
strength of the arm, or by the force of machinery,
until it coalesces, and becomes one
solid mass of iron. The hoop is then removed,
and the heatings and hammerings
repeated, until the iron, by being thus wrought
and kneaded, is freed from every impurity,
and rendered very tough and close in the
grain. The workmen then proceeds to draw
it out into pieces of about twenty-four inches
in length, half an inch or more in breadth,
and half an inch in thickness.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Damascus barrels</i> are thus described by
<i>Hawker</i>:—“I saw the process of making them,
the mixture of iron and steel for which is beat
out in long bars, and then, previously to being
wound round the anvil, twisted by a kind of
turning lathe, (similar to wringing clothes
when wet), and then beat flat again. Although
these are by far the dearest barrels that are
made, yet the price of one in Birmingham
is very trifling, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The stub barrels, which are generally used
for best guns, cost about sixteen shillings
each.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Damascene barrels are now unfashionable,
and never had anything to recommend
them, but as being a pretty novelty.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>On boring of barrels</i> there has been
much diversity of opinion; and if Colonel
Hawker’s theory be correct, the bore should
not be perfectly cylindrical.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the common sized guns,
which are usually made for the sports of the
field, there are two good ways of boring; the
one is, to leave a cylinder for about three-fourths
of the barrel, (always taking care,
however, to preserve a tightness for a little
friction just where the shot first moves), and
let the remaining part be gradually relieved
to the muzzle. For instance; suppose a barrel
to be two feet eight inches long, we would
say (beginning at the breech end) about six
inches tight, twenty-one inches a cylinder,
and the remaining five inches relieved to
the muzzle. All this must be done with
the most delicate possible gradation, and in so
small a degree, that even some gun-makers
could scarcely discover it. How natural, then,
is it, that many sporting authors should be
so far deceived, as to fancy the best guns are
bored a true cylinder, and therefore, argue in
its favour. This relief has the effect of
making the gun shoot as close as it can do,
compatibly with the strength and quickness
required, which should, however, be increased
as much as possible by the best constructed
breechings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other plan is, to make the barrel
regularly tighter all the way down, so that,
in firing, the shot goes progressively easier as
it approaches the muzzle. All this relief
must be given in a very trifling degree, because,
should the barrel be too much opened
in any part, it would admit of the powder
escaping between the wadding and the sides
of the calibre, by which the shooting of the
gun would be rendered weak. For this
reason, I should even object to having a hole
through the wadding that covers the powder,
which many do to prevent the confined air
from resisting the ramrod.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The imperfections to which a barrel is
liable in forging, are of three kinds, viz., the
<i>chink</i>, the <i>crack</i>, and the <i>flaw</i>. The <i>chink</i> is
a solution of continuity running lengthwise
of the barrel. The <i>crack</i> is a solution of
continuity more irregular in its form than the
chink, and running in a transverse direction,
or across the barrel. The <i>flaw</i> differs from
both; it is a small plate or scale, which adheres
to the barrel by a narrow base, from
which it spreads out as the head of a nail
does from its shank, and, when separated,
leaves a pit or hollow in the metal.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the soundness of the barrel,
the chink and flaw are of much greater importance
than the crack, as the effort of the
powder is exerted upon the circumference,
and not upon the length of the barrel. In a
sword or bow, the very reverse of this takes
place, for if a crack, though but of a slight
depth, occurs in either, it will break at that
place, when bent but very little, because the
effort is made upon the fibres disposed longitudinally,
whereas, if the fault be a chink, or
even a slight flaw, the sword or bow will not
give way. The flaw is much more frequent
than the chink, the latter scarcely ever
occurring but in barrels forged as above, in
which the fibres of the metal run longitudinally.
When external and superficial, they
are all defects in point of neatness only, but
when situated within the barrel, they are of
material disadvantage, by affording a lodgment
to moisture and foulness that corrode the
iron, and thus continually enlarge the excavation,
until the barrel bursts, or becomes
dangerous to use.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Colonel Hawker says, “that a barrel may
be pretty good, and perfectly safe, and yet
not able to bear the scientific inspection of a
first-rate maker or judge. That is, to hold
the barrel up to the window, and gradually
raise it, till the shade from above the window
runs along its surface, by which inspection
you will easily discover the most trifling want
of finish.”—<i>Essay on Shooting.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Bats flitting about late in the evening, in

<p class='c006'>This sport we call in England, most commonly
bird-batting, and some call it <i>low-belling</i>;
and the use of it is to go with a great
light of cressets, or rags of linen dipped in
tallow, which will make a good light; and
you must have a pan or plate made like a
lantern, to carry your light in, which must
have a great socket to hold the light, and
carry it before you, on your breast, with a
bell in your other hand, and of a great bigness,
made in the manner of a cow-bell, but
still larger; and you must ring it always after
one order.—If you carry the bell, you must
have two companions with nets, one on each
side of you; and what with the bell, and
what with the light, the birds will be so
amazed, that when you come near them, they
will turn up their white bellies: your companions
shall then lay their nets quietly upon
them, and take them. But you must continue
to ring the bell; for if the sound shall
cease, the other birds, if there be any more
near at hand, will rise up and fly away.—This
is an excellent method to catch larks,
woodcocks, partridges, and all other land-birds.—<i>Burton.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bath</span>, <i>s.</i> A bath is either hot or cold, either of art or nature; a vessel of

<p class='c006'>Both the warm and the cold bathings of
dogs are attended, in many cases, with the
happiest effects. When a <i>warm bath</i> is used
for a dog, the <i>heat</i> should be regulated according
to the case. In inflammations it should
be considerable, and in rheumatisms also; but
it must be remembered that, from habit,
many persons can bear, without inconvenience,
a heat that would be most distressing to
a dog; consequently, when it is attempted to
ascertain the heat by the hand alone, this
circumstance should be considered.</p>

<p class='c006'>The water bath should come all over the
animal, except the head; and when any one
particular part is more especially affected,
that part ought to be rubbed during the
bathing, with the hand. The dog being removed
from the water, the utmost care should
be observed to avoid his taking cold by exposure.
He should be first rubbed as dry as
may be by a change of cloths, and then be
put into a clothes-basket, wrapped up in a
blanket, and there confined till thoroughly
dry.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cold bathing</i> is also, in some instances,
very useful, particularly in the spasmodic
twitchings that succeed distemper; and in
some other cases of habitual weakness, as
rickets, &amp;c.: but for dogs in health, I am
convinced that bathing is not so salutary as is
often supposed.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>In Falconry.</i>—Hawks should bathe every
five or six days, in a clear stream, or pool, of
water, that is shallow at the edge; but when
these are not at hand, eyesses may be made
to bathe in pans sufficiently large for the
purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>A moderate quantity of food is to be given
to the hawk, before he is taken to the stream;
a creance is to be tied to the leash, and fastened
to the ground; he is then to be unhooded,
and placed near the water. The
falconer must then retire to a distance.
When the hawk has bathed, he should be
left to plume himself on the beach, as long
as he remains quiet, but he must be cautiously
taken up the moment he shows signs of uneasiness,
lest he should <i>bait in the creance</i>
with a full crop, which is always to be prevented

among sportsmen in the breeding of beagles,
and it was then the greatest merit to rear
dogs of the smallest growth. Amongst amateurs
of hunting, beagles were so carefully
selected in point of size, that they seldom
exceeded ten or eleven inches in height; and
they were so well matched with respect to
speed, that during the chase a good pack
might be covered with a sheet. This is with
all kinds of hounds a sure mark of excellence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although beagles are slow in speed, they
are uncommonly eager; for, if the scent lies
well, a hare has little chance of escape from
them. Their slowness, however, is the principal
reason of their being almost totally discontinued
in packs, and that they are now
seldom to be met with beyond a few couples,
used in some of the southern counties of
England to ensure finding more certainly in
greyhound coursing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hunting with the beagle was admirably
adapted for ladies and gentlemen up in years;
and, besides, afforded much amusement to
rustics, and other pedestrian hunters; for
there were few male persons of any activity
who could not keep up with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Colonel Hardy once had a pack
of beagles amounting to ten or twelve couples,
and so diminutive in size, that they were
always carried to and from the sporting field
in a large pair of panniers slung across a
horse. This curious pack was lost to the
colonel in a rather singular manner. It was
kept in a barn which was one night broken
open, when all the hounds and the panniers
were stolen; and, notwithstanding the most
diligent search, no trace of either could ever
be discovered.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Beans contain but five hundred and seventy
parts of nutritive matter, yet they add materially
to the vigour of the horse. There are
many horses that will not stand hard work
without beans being mingled with their food,
and these not horses whose tendency to purge
it may be necessary to restrain by the astringency
of the bean. There is no traveller who
is not aware of the difference in the spirit and
continuance of his horse if he allows or denies
him beans on his journey. They afford not
merely a temporary stimulus, but they may
be daily used without losing their power, or
producing exhaustion. Two pounds of beans
may, with advantage, be mixed with the chaff
of the agricultural horse, during the winter.
In summer, the quantity may be lessened, or
the beans altogether discontinued. Beans are
generally given whole. This is very absurd;
for the young horse, whose teeth are strong,
seldom requires them; while the old horse, to
whom they are in a manner necessary, is scarcely
able to masticate them, swallows many of
them whole which he is unable to break, and
drops much corn from his mouth in the ineffectual
attempt to break them. Beans should
not be merely split, but crushed; they will
even then give sufficient employment to the
grinders of the animal. Some postmasters use
chaff with beans instead of oats. With hardly-worked
horses they may possibly be allowed;
but in general cases, the beans, without oats,
would be too binding and stimulating, and
would produce costiveness, and probably megrims
or staggers.—<i>The Horse.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The Bernacle, (<i>Anas Erythropus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>La Bernacle</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) weighs about five
pounds, and measures more than two feet in
length, and nearly four and a half in breadth.
The bill, from the tip to the corners of the
mouth, is scarcely an inch and a half long,
black, and crossed with a pale reddish streak
on each side; a narrow black line passes from
the bill to the eyes, the irides of which are
brown; the head is small, and, as far as the
crown, together with the cheeks and throat,
white; the rest of the head and neck, to the
breast and shoulders, is black; the upper part
of the plumage is prettily marbled or barred
with blue, grey, black, and white; the feathers
of the back are black, edged with white,
and those of the wing coverts and scapulars,
blue grey, bordered with black near the margins,
and edged with white; the quills black,
edged a little way from the tips with blue
grey; the under parts and tail coverts white;
the thighs are marked with dusky lines or
spots, and are black near the knees; the tail
is black, and five inches and a half long; the
legs and feet dusky, very thick and short, and
have a stumpy appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to play billiards well, attention
must be given at first to the method of holding
the mace; to the position in which the
player should stand, and the manner of delivering
the hall from the mace; but these
are much more easily acquired by observation
or by the direction of a good player, than by
any possible written rules. A person who
plays with his right hand must stand with
his left foot foremost; and on the contrary
he who is left-handed must stand with his
right foot foremost, by which he will stand
more steady and firm. Immoderate bursts of
passion, and even fretting at trifling disappointments
in the game, are usually found
very prejudicial to the player; his nerves,
being affected, it is impossible for him to
make the stroke with that steadiness and
nicety the game requires.</p>

<p class='c006'>The games usually played till lately were
the white winning and the red winning carambole
games, but the winning and losing carambole
game is now very fashionable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The different games of billiards are—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The white winning game</i>, played with
two white balls, is twelve in number, when
two persons play, and fifteen when four play;
scored (independently of forfeitures) from
winning hazards only.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The white losing game</i>, also twelve in
number, played with two white balls, is the
reverse of the winning; the points being
scored from losing and double, or winning
and losing hazards.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The white winning and losing game</i> is a
combination of the two preceding; all balls
put in by striking the adversary’s ball first,
reckon towards the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding games should be introductory
to the knowledge of those with three or
more balls, which are more complicated and
difficult.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Choice of balls</i>, in which the player
chooses his ball each time, an incalculable
advantage, generally played against the losing
and winning game.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The bricole game</i>, signifies, being required
to strike a cushion, from whence the ball is to
rebound so as to hit that of the adversary,
reckoned equal to giving eight or nine points.
When both parties play bricole, the game is
ten, scored from bricole hazards, and forfeitures.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The bar-hole game</i>, so styled because the
hole which the ball should be played for is
barred, and the player strikes for another hole.
When this is played against the common
game, the advantage to the last-mentioned is
calculated at six points.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>One-hole</i>, in which all halls that go into
one hole are counted, and the player who best
lays his ball at the brink of that particular
hole, has the advantage. The lead should be
given from that end of the table where the
last hazard has been made.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hazards</i>, so styled as depending entirely
upon making hazards, no account being kept
of the game. Many persons may play at a table
with balls that are numbered, though to avoid
confusion seldom more than six play at once.
The person whose ball is put in pays a fixed
sum for each hazard to the player, and he
who misses pays half the same to him whose
ball he played at. The only general rule is
not to lay any ball a hazard for the next
player, which may best be done by always
playing upon him whose turn is next, and
either bringing his ball close to the cushion,
or putting it a distance from the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The doublet game</i> is ten in number,
played with two balls, most commonly against
the white winning game, and no hazard is
scored unless made by a reverberation from
the cushion, calculated as equivalent to giving
five points.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The commanding game</i>, where the adversary
fixes upon the ball which the striker is
to play at, reckoned equal to having fourteen
points out of twenty-four: usually given by
a skilful player against the common game of
an indifferent one.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The limited game</i> is very seldom played.
In it the table is divided by a line, beyond
which, if the striker pass his ball, he pays
forfeit.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The red or winning and losing carambole
game</i> consists of twenty-one or twenty-four
points, reckoned from caramboles, and
from winning and losing hazards, equally;
both white and red. Each of the white
hazards and the carambole counts two; the
red hazard three points.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The winning carambole</i> (or red) game is
sixteen or eighteen in number, obtained (independently
of the forfeitures which every
game has peculiar to itself), by winning
hazards and carom only.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The losing carambole</i> is nearly the reverse
of the winning, and consists of sixteen
or eighteen points, made by caramboles, losing
and double hazards; counted as in the winning
and losing game.</p>

<p class='c006'>N.B. The simple carambole is only a
trifling variation from the above.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carambole games are played with three
balls; one red which is neutral, and termed
the <i>carambole</i>: the other two white: one
of them allotted to each player. The <i>carambole</i>
is placed upon a spot on a line even with
the stringing nail at the bottom of the table,
and after leading from the upper end the
striker is either to make the winning or losing
hazard, according to the particular game, or to
hit with his own ball the other two successively;
for which stroke, called a <i>carambole</i>
or <i>carom</i>, he obtains two points.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Russian carambole</i> varies from the
common carambole in the following particulars:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The red ball is to be placed upon the usual
spot; but the player, at the commencement of
the game, or after his ball has been holed, is
at liberty to place it where he pleases. The
leader, instead of striking at the red ball,
should lay his own gently behind the same,
and the opponent may play at either of them;
if the said opponent play at and hole the red
ball, he scores three; then the red ball is to
be replaced upon the spot, and the player
may take his choice again, always following his
stroke till both balls are off the table; he
gains two points for every carambole; but if
in doing that he hole his own ball, then he
loses as many as otherwise he would have
obtained; and if he strike at the red ball, and
should carambole and hole that ball and his
own, he loses five points; and when he holes
all three balls he loses seven, which respective
numbers he would have won had he not holed
his own ball.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The caroline</i> or <i>carline game</i> is played
either on a round or square table with five
balls, two white, one red, another blue, and
the caroline ball yellow. The red ball is to
be placed on its usual spot, the caroline ball
exactly in the middle of the table, and the
blue ball between the two at the lower end
of the table. The striking spot is at the
upper end, in a parallel line with the three
balls. The game is 42, scored from caramboles
and hazards; the red hazard counts
three, the blue two, and the yellow, when
holed in the caroline or middle pocket, is
reckoned at six points.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The four game</i> consists of two partners on
each side at any of the common games, who
play in succession after every winning hazard
lost.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The cushion game</i> consists in the striker
playing his ball from the top of the baulk
cushion, instead of following his stroke upon
the table, and is generally played in the winning,
or winning and losing game, reckoned
equal to giving six points.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fortification Billiards</i>, for an account of
which see Hoyle.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the <i>red</i>, or <i>winning and losing game</i>,
is that most commonly played, and as its regulations
are, with trifling exceptions, applicable
to all the others, the following will be found
a correct code of the general laws of billiards.
For tables of the odds, and a description of
particular games, the reader is referred to the
later editions of Hoyle.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rules &amp;c. in the winning and losing
carambole game.</i>—1. The game commences
by stringing for the lead and choice of balls.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In stringing, the striker must place his
ball within the striking ring; and, if his
adversary desire it, must stand within the
limits of the corner of the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. He who, after playing at the bottom
cushion, brings his ball nearest to the cushion,
at the upper or baulk end of the table, wins
the lead, and chooses his ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. After the first person has strung for the
lead, if the adversary who follows should make
his ball touch the other, he loses the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. By holing his own ball, either in stringing
or leading, the player loses the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Should the leader follow his ball, with
either mace or cue, beyond the middle hole,
it is no lead; and his adversary may make
him lead again.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. The leader must place his ball within
the ring, between the striking nails or spots
at the upper end of the table: and the same
must be observed after every losing hazard
has been got.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. The red ball is to be placed on the
lower of the two spots, at the bottom of the
table.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. When either of the white balls has
been holed, &amp;c., it must be replaced in, and
played from the striking ring, as at the commencement
of the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. When the red ball has been holed or
forced over the table, it must be replaced on
the same spot as at the beginning of the game,
and the present striker is bound to see it thus
replaced, otherwise he cannot win any points
while it is off the spot, and the stroke he may
make is deemed foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. If the striker do not hit his adversary’s
ball, he loses one point; and if by the same
stroke he pocket his own ball, he loses three
points and the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. If the striker force either of the balls
over the table, he loses the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. If the striker force his own, or either
of the other balls over the table, after having
made a carambole or hazard, he gains nothing,
and also loses the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. If the striker hit both the red and his
adversary’s ball with his own ball, this is
called a <i>carambole</i> or <i>carom</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. If the striker with his own hole his
adversary’s ball, he wins two points.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. If the striker hole the red ball, he
wins three points.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. If the striker hole his own off his
adversary’s ball, he wins two points.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. If the striker hole his own off the red
ball, he wins three points.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. If the striker hole both his adversary’s
and the red ball, he wins five points.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. If the striker, by playing at the red
ball, hole his own and the red ball, he wins
six points.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. If the striker, by hitting the white ball
first, hole both his own and the adversary’s
ball, he wins four points.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. If the striker, by striking at the red
ball first, hole both his own and his adversary’s
ball, he wins five points: three for
holing his own ball off the red, and two for
holing the white ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. If the striker play at his adversary’s
ball first, and hole his own ball and the red,
he wins five points: two for holing his own
ball off the white, and three for holing the
red ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. If the striker play at his adversary’s
ball, and hole it, at the same time that he
pockets both his own ball and the red, he
wins seven points: two for holing his own
ball off the white, two for holing his adversary’s,
and three for holing the red ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. If the striker play at the red, and hole
his own ball off the same, and the red ball,
and his adversary’s ball, by the same stroke,
he wins eight points: three for holing his
own ball off the red, three for holing the red,
and two for holing the white ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. If the striker make a carambole, and
by the same stroke pocket his adversary’s ball,
he wins four points: two for the carambole,
and two for the white hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>27. If the striker make a carambole, and
pocket the red ball, he wins five points: two
for the carambole, and three for the red
hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. If the striker should carambole, and
hole both the red and his adversary’s ball, he
gains seven points: two for the carambole,
two for the white, and three for the red ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. If the striker make a carambole by
striking the white ball first, and hole his own
by the same stroke, he wins four points: two
for the carom, and two for the white losing
hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. If the striker make a carambole by
striking the red ball first, and by the same
stroke pocket his own ball, he wins five
points: two for the carambole, and three for
the red losing hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. If the striker play at the white ball
first, and should make a carambole, and also
hole his own and his adversary’s ball, he wins
six points: two for the carambole, and two
for each white hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>32. If the striker play at the red ball first,
and carambole, and should likewise hole his
own and his adversary’s ball, he gains seven
points: two for the carom, three for the red
hazard, and two for the white hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>33. If the striker should carambole by
playing first at the white ball, and also hole
his own and the red ball, he wins seven
points: two for the carom, two for the white
losing hazard, and three for the red winning
hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>35. If the striker should carambole by
striking the white ball first, and hole his own
and his adversary’s, and the red ball, he wins
nine points: two for the carambole, two for
each of the white hazards, and three for the
red hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>36. If the striker should carambole by
striking the red ball first, and by the same
stroke hole his own and the red, and his
adversary’s ball, he gains ten points: two for
the carambole, three for red losing, three
for the red winning, and two for the white
winning hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>37. After the adversary’s ball is off the
table, and the two remaining balls are either
upon the line, or within the stringing nails or
spots, at the upper end where the white balls
are originally placed in leading, it is called a
<i>baulk</i>; and the striker, who is to play from
the ring, must strike the opposite cushion, to
make his ball rebound, so as to hit one of the
balls in the baulk—which if he do not, he
loses one point.</p>

<p class='c006'>38. It sometimes happens, after the red
ball has been holed or forced over the table,
that one of the white balls so occupies its
place, that it cannot be put upon its proper
spot without touching the same. In such a
case, the marker must hold the red ball in
his hand, while the striker plays at his adversary’s
ball, and immediately afterwards replace
the red on its proper spot, so that it may not
prevent a carambole, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>39. If the striker play with the wrong ball,
it is a foul stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>40. If the striker be going to play with the
wrong ball, no person ought to discover it to
him, except his partner, when they are playing
a double match.</p>

<p class='c006'>41. If the striker play with the wrong ball,
and his adversary should not discover it, he
may reckon all the points gained by the
stroke, and the marker is obliged to score
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>42. If the striker, after having made a
hazard or carom, move with his hand or stick
either of the balls which remain upon the
table, the stroke is deemed foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>43. If a ball be found to have been changed
during the game, and it is not known by which
player, the game must be played out with the
balls as they then are.</p>

<p class='c006'>44. No one has a right to take up or otherwise
move a ball, without permission of the
adversary.</p>

<p class='c006'>45. If a striker touch his ball with the
instrument twice, the stroke is foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>46. If a striker be impeded in his stroke
by his adversary or a spectator, he has a right
to recommence the stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>47. If the striker should accidentally move
his own ball, without intending at the time to
make a stroke, he loses no point; but the
adversary may replace the ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>48. If the striker touch his ball, and make
his mace or cue go over or past it, he loses
one point.</p>

<p class='c006'>49. If either of the players, in the act of
striking, happen to move his own, the adversary’s,
or the red ball, from the place it
occupied on the table, it is a foul stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>50. When the striker’s, and either of the
other balls are so close as to touch, and in
playing the former off, the latter is moved
from its place, the stroke is considered foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>51. If the striker, in attempting a stroke,
do not touch his ball, it is no stroke, and he
must strike again.</p>

<p class='c006'>52. If, when the balls are very near each
other, the striker should make his ball touch
the other, it is to be considered a stroke,
though not intended as such.</p>

<p class='c006'>53. If the striker play upon a ball which
is still running, the stroke is foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>54. Whoever stops a ball when running,
loses the lead; if his adversary do not like the
ball he has to play at the next stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>55. Whoever retains his adversary’s cue or
mace, when in the act of striking, makes the
stroke foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>56. If the striker interrupt the course of
his own ball, when running towards a hole,
after having made a miss, and it is the opinion
of the marker that it would have entered the
pocket, had it not been interrupted, he loses
three points.</p>

<p class='c006'>57. And if the striker should interrupt,
stop, or put his adversary’s ball out of its
course, when running towards or into a hole,
he is subjected to the same forfeiture.</p>

<p class='c006'>58. If the striker, after having made a
hazard, or carambole, interrupt the course of
his own ball, the stroke is foul, and he cannot
score any of the points he may have thus
made.</p>

<p class='c006'>59. He who blows upon a ball when
running makes the stroke foul; and if his
own ball were running towards a hole, or
near a hole, and he be seen by his adversary
to blow upon it, he loses two points.</p>

<p class='c006'>60. If the striker play with both feet off
the ground, the stroke is deemed foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>61. Whoever strikes the table when the
ball is running, makes the stroke foul.</p>

<p class='c006'>62. If the striker throws his mace or cue
upon the table so as to baulk his adversary,
he causes him to make a foul stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>63. If a ball be made to go extremely near
the brink of a hole, and after sensibly standing
still, falls into it, the striker wins nothing,
and the ball must be put on the same
brink where it stood before the adversary
makes his next stroke; and if it should fall
into the hole at the instant the striker hath
played upon his ball, so as to prevent the
success of his stroke, the striker’s and the
adversary’s balls must be placed in the same
relative position, and the striker play again.</p>

<p class='c006'>64. He who will not play the game out,
loses the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>65. If a person agree to play with the cue,
he is obliged to play with it during the whole
of the game or match; but if no agreement
have been made, he may at any time change
it for the mace, and <i>vice versâ</i>. But when
the parties agree to play mace against cue,
the mace player has no right to use a cue,
nor has the cue player any right to use a
mace, without permission.</p>

<p class='c006'>66. When a person agrees to play with a
cue, he must play every ball within his reach
with the point thereof; and if he should agree
to play with the butt of the cue, he has no
right at any time to play with the point without
permission. Also, when the parties agree
to play <i>point and point</i> of the cue, neither
of them has any right to use the <i>butt</i>: but
every person who plays with a cue, may use
occasionally a long one, and in such case he
may play with the point of a long cue or a
mace.</p>

<p class='c006'>67. If the striker should make his mace or
cue touch both balls at the same time, it is
deemed a foul stroke, and if discovered by the
adversary, he wins nothing for any points he
might make by the stroke, and the adversary
may break or part the balls.</p>

<p class='c006'>68. Whenever a foul stroke is made, it is
at the option of the adversary either to part
the balls, and play from the striking ring, as
at the beginning, or, if the balls happen to be
in a favourable position for himself, to suffer
the preceding striker to score the points;
which the marker is obliged to do in every
case where the balls are not broken.</p>

<p class='c006'>69. The adversary only is bound to see that
the striker plays fair, which, if he neglect, the
striker wins all the points he may have made
by that particular stroke, and the marker is
obliged to score them.</p>

<p class='c006'>70. No person has a right to discover
whether a stroke be fair or foul until asked,
unless during a four match; and in that case
none but the player or his partner has a right
to ask it.</p>

<p class='c006'>71. Should a dispute arise between the
players concerning the fairness of a stroke, the
marker alone is authorised to decide, and from
his decision there is no appeal: but if he happen
to be incompetent, the majority of the
disinterested company then present should
decide the dispute.</p>

<p class='c006'>72. Whoever proposes to part the balls,
and his adversary agrees, the person who made
the proposal loses the lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>73. No person in the room has a right
to bet more than the odds on a hazard or a
game; but if he err through ignorance, he
should appeal to the marker, or the table of
the odds. Each person who proposes a bet
should name the precise sum; and also should
be extremely careful not to offer a bet when
the striker has taken his aim, or is going to
strike; and no bet ought to be proposed on
any stroke, that may have any tendency to
influence the player. If A propose a bet
which is accepted by B, it must be confirmed
by A, otherwise it is no bet. If any bets be
laid on the hazard, and the striker should lose
the game by a miss, at the stroke in question,
it cannot be a hazard, the game being out by a
miss. In all cases the betters are to abide by
the determination of the players, and the
betters have a right to demand their money
when their game is over.</p>

<p class='c006'>74. Every person ought to be very attentive,
and listen for the stroke, before he opens
the door of a billiard-room.</p>

<p class='c006'>75. The striker has a right to command his
adversary not to stand facing or near him, so
as to annoy or molest him in his stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>76. Each party is to take care of his own
game, and his adversary has no right to answer
any questions; as, if the ball be close?—if he
touch the ball? &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>77. The marker should make those persons
who do not play stand from the table, and
give room for the players to pass freely round.</p>

<p class='c006'>78. Those who play ought to be particularly
careful and attentive to their strokes,
when any bets are depending thereon: but
even should they play carelessly, the bets
must, in every case, be decided by the event.</p>

<p class='c006'>79. No person has any right to discover to
the player in what manner he may play his
ball. And if it be done, and discovered by
the adversary, he may prevent the striker
from scoring the points he has made by the
stroke. Neither, after a stroke has been
played, has any one a right to detect any
error the striker may have committed.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Dutch Baron.</i>—A few years since
the gentlemen of the green cloth were put
out of cue, by a hero of the hazard table
imported from the continent by one of the
squad, who, while he pretended to be playing
the losing game, was shrewdly suspected of
going snacks in all that rolls into the pocket.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Dutch baron was introduced by his
friend, who happened to have known him at
Hamburgh. He played in a crowd of billiard
amateurs and professors, many of whom were
raw, and lost about one hundred and fifty
guineas with the utmost <i>sang froid</i>. Upon
his retiring, his friend told the company he
was a fine pigeon, a Dutch baron, who had
emigrated from Holland, with immense property,
and who would as readily lose ten
thousand pounds as ten guineas. “Who is
he?” was eagerly inquired. “A Dutch
baron, as rich as a Jew,” was answered in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c006'>No Batavian ever laid out an hundred and
fifty guineas so well as the Dutch baron. The
whole corps of riflemen flocked around him
like a swarm of fish at a piece of bread. But
little P——, well known at Bath, who
thought he best knew how to make his market,
like a man of business, applied to the
baron’s friend to have the first plucking. The
friend, as a great favour, engaged to use his
influence; little P—— was at the billiard
table the first man in the morning, that he
might secure the play in his own hands. The
baron came: to it they went; little P——
kept back his play: the Dutch baron played
but poorly. Fair strokes he often missed;
but whenever he was at an important point he
won as if by accident. On they went—Hambletonian
and Diamond. Little P—— was
afraid of frightening the baron, by disclosing
the extent of his play; the baron played so
as to persuade every one he knew little of the
game. The contest was who should play
worst at indifferent periods, and who, without
seeming to play well, should play best at
important points. The baron won all on
great occasions, till little P—— had lost
about £100. But the baron managed so
well that no one thought he could play at all,
and although little P—— was sickened, yet
the bait of 150 guineas found plenty of customers.
Some of them, the greatest adepts in
the kingdom, gave the baron, at starting, three
points in the game; but the baron’s accidental
good play was so superior, whenever a stake
was down, he at last gave three points to those
who had given him three points, and still beat
them—by accident; and before the billiard
knowing ones at Bath would stop, the baron
had won nearly ten thousand pounds, with
which he made a bow, and came to London.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this Dutch nobleman’s fame travelled
almost as fast as himself, and he was found
out; not, however, till he had sweated some
of the most knowing gentlemen of the cue.</p>

<p class='c006'>He concealed his play so well, that no one
could form an idea of its extent. To the
best billiard players he gave points, and always
won on important occasions. He seemed to
be a very conjurer, commanding the balls to
roll as he pleased; and there was nothing to
be named, that it is not supposed he could
accomplish.</p>

<p class='c006'>And who was the Dutch baron? In Hamburgh,
he was the marker at a billiard table!—<i>Hoyle</i>—<i>Anecdotes

<p class='c006'>The term of life varies greatly in birds, and
does not seem to bear the same proportion to
the time of acquiring their growth, as has
been remarked with regard to quadrupeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most birds acquire their full dimensions in
the course of a few months, and are capable
of propagation the first summer after they are
hatched. In proportion to the size of their
bodies, birds possess more vitality, and live
longer, than either man or quadrupeds: notwithstanding
the difficulties which arise in
ascertaining the age of birds, there are instances
of great longevity in many of them.
Geese and swans have been known to attain
to the age of seventy and upwards; ravens
are very long-lived birds—they are said sometimes
to exceed a century; eagles are supposed
to arrive at a great age; pigeons are known to
live more than twenty years; and even linnets,
and other small birds, have been kept
in cages from fifteen to twenty years.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Every part of their frame is formed for
lightness and buoyancy; their bodies are
covered with a soft and delicate plumage, so
disposed as to protect them from the intense
cold of the atmosphere through which they
pass; their wings are made of the lightest
materials, and yet the force with which they
strike the air is so great, as to impel their
bodies forward with astonishing rapidity,
whilst the tail serves the purpose of a rudder,
to direct them to the different objects of their
pursuit. The internal structure of birds is
no less wisely adapted to the same purposes:
all the bones are light and thin, and all the
muscles, except those which are appropriated
to the purpose of moving the wings, are extremely
delicate and light; the lungs are
placed close to the back-bone and ribs, the
air, entering into them by a communication
from the wind-pipe, passes through, and is
conveyed into a number of membranous
cells which lie upon the sides of the pericardium,
and communicate with those of the
sternum. In some birds these cells are continued
down the wings, and extended even to
the pinions, thigh-bones, and other parts of
the body, which can be filled and distended
with air at the pleasure of the animal.—<i>Vide</i>
<span class='sc'>Air Cells</span>.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It seems evident that this general diffusion
of air through the bodies of birds is of infinite
use to them, not only in their long and laborious
flights, but likewise in preventing their
respiration from being stopped or interrupted
by the rapidity of their motion through a
resisting medium. Were it possible for man
to move with the swiftness of a swallow, the
actual resistance of the air, as he is not provided
with internal reservoirs similar to those
of birds, would soon suffocate him.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The migration of birds would appear miraculous,
did we not know their extraordinary
power of flight. Speaking of this, Bewick
says—“If we can suppose a bird to go at the
rate of only half a mile in a minute, for the
space of twenty-four hours, it will have gone
over, in that time, an extent of more than
seven hundred miles, which is sufficient to
account for almost the longest migration;
but, if aided by a favourable current of air,
there is reason to suppose that the same
journey may be performed in a much shorter
space of time. To these observations we may
add, that the sight of birds is peculiarly quick
and piercing; and from the advantage they
possess in being raised to considerable heights
in the air, they are enabled, with a sagacity
peculiar to instinctive knowledge, to discover
the route they are to take, from the appearance
of the atmosphere, the clouds, the
direction of the winds, and other causes; so
that, without having recourse to improbable
modes, it is easy to conceive, from the velocity
of their speed alone, that most birds may
transport themselves to countries lying at
great distances, and across vast tracts of
ocean.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In speaking of the flight of birds, Mr.
Rennie says—“Their capability of performing
flights much longer than there is any
necessity for supposing, may be proved by
numerous facts. Even a sparrow has been
calculated to fly at the rate of not less than
thirty miles an hour, and many experiments
prove that the eider duck can fly ninety miles
in the same time. The common kite (<i>falco
milvus</i>) has been observed to pass, without
great exertion, over a space of a quarter of a
league, in a minute; and it could fly, with
ease, from Cape Pruth to the Land’s End, in
a single day. M. Audubon, the distinguished
ornithologist, has shot the passenger pigeon of
America, and on dissection, found its stomach
full of fresh rice, which, to have resisted the
digestive process, must have been swallowed
<i>not many hours</i> preceding its death, but
could not have been obtained within eight
hundred miles of the place where it was
killed. Though the nightingale, the willow-wren,
and other birds of passage, fly with only
half the swiftness, they may easily arrive in
most parts of the south of Europe, or the
north of Africa, in a few days.”—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Rennie</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>In the suburbs of London there are many
persons, who, during the months of October
and March, get their livelihood by an ingenious,
and we may add, a scientific, method of
bird-catching, which is totally unknown to
other parts of Great Britain. The reason of
this trade being confined to so small a compass,
arises from there being no considerable
sale for singing birds except in the metropolis;
and as the apparatus for their purpose is
heavy, and must be carried on a man’s back,
it prevents the bird-catchers going to above
three or four miles’ distance. This method of
bird-catching must have been long practised,
as it is brought to a most systematic perfection,
and is attended with very considerable
expense. The nets are a most ingenious
piece of mechanism, are generally twelve
yards and a half long, and two and a half
wide; and no one, till he becomes eye-witness
of the puller’s success, would imagine
that a bird, which is so very quick in all its
motions, could be caught by the nets flapping
over each other. The wild birds fly, as the
bird-catchers term it, chiefly during the month
of October, and part of September and November,
as the flight in March is much less
considerable than that of Michaelmas. The
several species of birds do not make their appearance
precisely at the same time during
the months of September, October, and November.
The pipet, a small species of lark,
but inferior to the others in singing, for example,
begins to fly about Michaelmas, and
then the woodlark, linnet, goldfinch, chaffinch,
greenfinch, and other birds of flight, succeed;
all of which are not easily caught, or in any
numbers at any other time, and more particularly
the pipet and the woodlark. These
birds, during the Michaelmas and March flights,
are chiefly on the wing from day-break to
noon, though there is afterwards a small flight
from two till night, but this is so inconsiderable,
that the bird-catchers take up their nets
at noon. It well deserves the attention of
the naturalist whence these periodical flights of
certain birds arise. As the ground, however,
is ploughed during the months of October
and March for sowing the winter and spring
corn, it should seem that they are thus supplied
with a profusion both of seeds and insects,
which they cannot so easily procure at
any other season. It has been observed, too,
that, during their sitting, they fly always
against the wind; hence, there is great contention
amongst the bird-catchers, who shall
gain that point. If, for example, it is westerly,
the bird-catcher who lays his nets most to
the east, is sure almost of catching every
thing, provided his call birds are good; a
gentle wind to the south-west generally produces
the best sport. The bird-catcher generally
carries with him five or six linnets, of
which more are caught than any other singing-bird,
two goldfinches, two greenfinches,
one woodlark, one redpole, a yellow hammer,
titlark and aberdevine, and perhaps a bullfinch;
these are placed at small distances
from the nets, in little cages. He has besides
what are called slur-birds, which are
placed within the nets, are raised upon the
slur, and gently let down at the time the
wild bird approaches them. The slur is a
moveable perch to which the bird is tied, and
which the bird-catcher can raise at pleasure
by means of a long string fastened to it. The
slur-birds generally consist of the linnet, goldfinch,
and greenfinch, which are secured to
the slur by what is called a brace, which
secures the bird without injuring the plumage.
It is a sort of bandage, formed of a slender
silken string, fastened round the body, and
under the wings, so as to hinder the bird
from being hurt, let it flutter ever so much.
As it has been found that there is a superiority
in birds that are in song, the bird-catchers
contrive that their call-birds should
moult before the usual time. They therefore,
in June or July, put them into a box,
quite close under two or three folds of blankets,
and leave their dung in the cage to raise
a greater heat, in which state they continue,
being perhaps examined but once a week to
have fresh water. As for food, the air is
so putrid, that they eat little during the
whole state of confinement; which lasts about
a month. The birds frequently die under the
operation, and hence the value of a stopped
bird, as the bird-catchers style it, rises greatly.
When the bird has thus prematurely moulted,
he is in song whilst the wild birds are out of
song, and his note is louder and more piercing
than that of a wild one; but it is not only in
his note he receives an alteration, the plumage
is also improved. The black and yellow in
the wings of the goldfinch, for example,
become deeper and more vivid, and acquire a
beautiful gloss, which is not to be seen in the
wild bird. The bill, which, in the latter, is
black at the end, in the stopped bird becomes
white and more taper, as do its legs; in
short, there is as much difference between a
wild and a stopped bird, as there is between a
horse kept in body-clothes, and one at grass.
When the bird-catcher has laid his nets, he
disposes his call-birds at proper intervals.
There is a most malicious joy in these call-birds,
to bring the wild ones into the same
captivity, which may likewise be observed
with regard to decoy ducks. (<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Decoy</span>.)
Their sight and hearing infinitely excel those
of the bird-catcher. The moment they see
a hawk they communicate the alarm to each
other by a plaintive note, nor will they then
jerk or call though the wild birds are near.
But at any other time, the instant that the
wild birds are perceived, notice is given by
one to the rest of the call-birds, as by the
first hound that hits on the scent, to the rest
of the pack, after which follows the same sort
of tumultuous joy. The call-birds, while the
bird is at a distance, do not sing as a bird does
in a chamber; they invite the wild ones by
what the bird-catchers call short jerks, which,
when the birds are good, may be heard at a
great distance. The ascendancy by this call
is so great, that the wildest bird is stopped in
his flight; and, if not a sharper, as the bird-catchers
style a bird acquainted with the nets,
lights boldly within twenty yards perhaps of
three or four bird-catchers, on a spot which,
otherwise, it would not have taken the least
notice of. Nay, it frequently happens, that
if only half a flock are caught, the remainder
will immediately after light in the nets, and
share the same fate, and should only one bird
escape, that bird will suffer itself to be pulled
at till it is caught, such a fascinating power
have these call-birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it is worth mentioning, that the bird-catchers
frequently lay considerable wagers
whose call-bird can jerk the longest, as that
determines the superiority. They place them
opposite to each other, by an inch of candle,
and the bird who jerks the oftenest before the
candle is burnt out, wins the wager. There
have been instances of a bird giving 170 jerks
in a quarter of an hour; and of a linnet, in
such a trial, persevering in its emulation till it
swooned from the perch. Birds, when near
each other, and in sight, seldom jerk or sing.
They either fight, or use short and wheedling
calls; the jerking of these call-birds, therefore,
face to face, is a most extraordinary instance
of contention for superiority in song.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various methods are used to catch different
kinds of birds. The bullfinch, though not
properly a singing bird, or a bird of flight, as
it does not move farther than from hedge to
hedge, yet, as it sells well on account of its
learning to whistle tunes, and sometimes flies
over where the nets are laid, the bird-catchers
have often a call-bird to ensnare it, though
most of them can imitate the call with their
mouths. It is remarkable that the female
bullfinch answers the purpose of a call-bird as
well as the male, which is not experienced in
any other species of bird taken by the London
bird-catchers. The nightingale is not a bird
of flight, in the sense in which the bird-catchers
use the term. Like the robin, wren,
and many other singing birds, it only moves
from hedge to hedge, and does not take the
periodical flights in October and March. Those
who catch these birds make use of small trap-nets,
without call-birds, and are considered as
inferior in dignity to other bird-catchers, who
will not rank with them. The arrival of the
nightingale is expected by the trappers in the
neighbourhood of London, the first week in
April; at the beginning, none but cocks are
taken, but in a few days the hens make their
appearance, generally by themselves, though
sometimes with a few males. The latter are
distinguished from the females, not only by
their superior size, but by a great swelling of
their vent, which commences on the first arrival
of the hens. They are caught in a net-trap,
the bottom of which is surrounded with
an iron ring; the net itself is rather larger
than a cabbage-net. When the trappers hear
or see them, they strew some fresh mould
under the place, and bait the trap with a meal-worm.
Ten or a dozen have been thus caught
in a day. The common way of taking larks
(<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Lark</span>) is in the night, with nets called
trammels. These are usually made of thirty-six
yards in length, and about six yards over,
with six ribs of pack-thread, which at the
ends are put upon two poles about sixteen
feet long, and made lesser at each end. These
are to be drawn over the ground by two men,
and every five or six steps the net is made to
touch the ground, otherwise it would pass over
the birds without touching them. When they
are felt to fly up against the net, it is clapped
down, and then all are safe that are under it.
The darkest nights are best for this sport; and
the net will not only take larks but all other
birds that roost on the ground. In the depth
of winter people sometimes take great numbers
of larks by nooses of horse-hair. The
method is this:—Take 100 or 300 yards of
pack-thread; fasten at every six inches a noose
made of horse-hair; at every twenty yards the
line is to be pegged down to the ground, and
so left ready to take them. The time to use
this is when the ground is covered with snow,
and the larks are to be allured to it by some
white oats, scattered all the way among the
nooses. They must be taken away as soon
as three or four are hung, otherwise the rest
will be frightened, but though the others are
scared away just where the sportsman comes,
they will be feeding at the other end of the
line, and the sport may be thus continued for
a long time. Those caught in the day are
taken in clap-nets of fifteen yards long, and
two and a half broad, and are enticed within
their reach by bits of looking-glass, fixed in a
piece of a wood, and placed in the middle of
the nets, which are put in a quick whirling
motion by the string the larker commands; he
also makes use of a decoy-lark. These nets
are used only till the fourteenth of November,
for the larks will not dare to frolic in the
air except in fine sunny weather, and of
course cannot be inveigled into the snare.
When the weather grows gloomy, the larker
changes his engine, and makes use of a trammel-net,
twenty-seven or twenty-eight feet
long, and five broad, which is put on two
poles eighteen feet long, and carried by men
under each arm, who pass over the field and
quarter the ground like a setting dog; when
they hear or feel a lark hit the net, they drop
it down, and so the birds are taken. Linnæus
observes, that the male chaffinches
fly by themselves, and in the flight precede
the females, but this is not peculiar to them.
When the tit-larks are caught in the beginning
of the season, it frequently happens that
forty are taken and not one female among
them, and probably the same would be observed
as to other birds (as has been done
with relation to the wheatear) if they were
attended to. Experienced bird-catchers tell
us, that such birds as breed twice a year, generally
have in their first brood a majority of
males, and in their second, of females, which
may, in part, account for the above observation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Birding-piece</span>, <i>s.</i> A gun to shoot birds with; an ancient fowling-piece.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Birdlime</span>, <i>s.</i> A glutinous substance spread upon twigs, by which the
birds that light upon them are entangled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birdlime is prepared in different ways. The
best birdlime is made of the middle bark of
the holly boiled seven or eight hours in water,
till it is soft and tender, then laid in heaps in
pits in the ground, and covered with stones,
the water being previously drawn from it, and
in this state left for two or three weeks to
ferment, till it is reduced to a kind of mucilage.
This being taken from the pit, is pounded in
a mortar, to a paste, washed in river water,
and kneaded, till it is free from extraneous
matters. In this state it is left four or five
days in earthen vessels, to ferment and purify
itself, when it is fit for use. It reddens tincture
of litmus. Exposed to a gentle heat, it
liquifies slightly, swells in bubbles, becomes
grumous, emits a smell resembling that of
animal oils, grows brown, but recovers its
properties on cooling, if not heated too much.
The residuum contains sulphate and muriate
of potash, carbonate of lime, and alumina,
with a small portion of iron.</p>

<p class='c006'>The misletoe affords a juice superior to that
of the holly; and if a young shoot of the
common alder be cut through, a stringy juice
will draw out in threads, and follow the knife
like birdlime, or the juice of the holly.</p>

<p class='c006'>When birdlime is to be put in wet places,
the common birdlime is apt to have its force
soon taken away. It is necessary, therefore,
to have recourse to a particular sort, which,
from its property of bearing water unhurt, is
called water birdlime, and is prepared thus:
Take a pound of strong birdlime, wash it in
spring water till the hardness is all removed;
then beat it well, that the water may be well
separated, so as not a drop remains; then dry
it well, and put it into an earthen pot, add to
it as much grease as will make it run, with
two teaspoonfuls of strong vinegar, one spoonful
of oil, and a small quantity of Venice
turpentine; let the whole boil for some
minutes over a moderate fire, stirring it all
the while; then take it off, and, when there
is occasion to use it, warm it, and cover the
sticks well with it. This is the best sort of
birdlime for snipes, and other birds that frequent
wet places.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most successful method of using birdlime
is this:—Cut down the branch of any
bushy tree, whose twigs are thick, straight,
and smooth. The willow and the birch tree
afford the best of this kind. Let all the
superfluous shoots be trimmed off, and the
twigs all made neat and clean; they must all
be well covered with the birdlime, within
four inches of the bottom: no part of the
bark where the lime should come must be
left bare; but it is a nice matter to lay it on
properly, for if it be too thick it will give the
birds a distaste, and they will not come near
it; and if there be too little of it, it will not
hold when they come there. When the
bush is thus prepared, it must be set up in
some dead hedge, or among bushes near the
outskirts of a town, or the like, in the spring,
for these places are the resort of small birds
at that time. If it be used in summer, the
bush must be placed in the midst of a quickset
hedge, or in whitethorn trees, near fields
of corn; and, in the winter, the proper places
are about stacks of corn, hovels, barns, and
the like. When the lime-bush is thus planted,
the sportsman must stand as near it as he can
without being discovered, and with the mouth,
or otherwise, make such notes as the birds do
when they attack or call to one another. The
time of day for this sport is from sunrise to
ten o’clock, and from one to sunset. Another
very good method of bringing the birds together
is by a stale. A bat makes a very good
stale, but it must be fastened so as to be in
sight at a distance. An owl is a still better
stale, for this bird never goes abroad but it is
followed by all the small birds. They will
gather together in great numbers about it, and
having no convenient place to sit on but the
lime-bush, many will be taken. If a living
owl or bat is not to be had, the skin stuffed
will serve the purpose, and will last twenty
years. Some have used the image of an owl
carved in wood, and painted in the natural
colours, and it has been found to succeed
very well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Birds, Method of Preserving.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>Various methods have been attempted for preserving
birds from putrefaction, so as to retain
their natural form and position, as well as the
beauty of their colours and plumage. A good
antiseptic for animal substances has been much
inquired after, as, for want of it, many curious
animals, and birds particularly, from
foreign parts, entirely miscarry, and others of
the finest plumage are devoured by insects.
The following improved method by Dr. Lettsom
seems to be the least troublesome, and
the most complete. After opening the bird
by a longitudinal incision from the breast to
the vent, dissecting the fleshy parts from the
bones, and removing the entrails, eyes, tongue,
and brains, (which in large birds may be extracted
through the eye-holes with a surgeon’s
directar,) the cavities and inside of the skin
are to be sprinkled with the powders mentioned
below. Glass eyes, which are preferable
to wax, are then to be inserted, and the
head stuffed with cotton or tow, and a wire
is to be passed down the throat through one
of the nostrils, and fixed on the breast bone.
Wires also to be introduced through the feet,
up the legs and thighs, and inserted into the
same bone; next fill the body with cotton to
its natural size, and sew the skin over it; the
attitude is lastly to be attended to, and whatever
position the subject is placed in to dry,
it will be retained afterwards. The dyeing
compound is as follows:—</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'>Mix the whole, and keep it in a glass vessel,
stopped close. Small birds may be preserved
in brandy, rum, arrack, or first runnings;
though the colour of the plumage is
liable to be extracted by the spirit. Large
sea-fowl have thick strong skins, and such
may be skinned; the tail, claws, head, and
feet are carefully to be preserved, and the
plumage stained as little as possible with
blood. The inside of the skin may be stuffed
as above. Kuckahu observes, (in the Phil.
Trans. vol. ix. p. 319.) that “Baking is not
only useful in the fresh preservations, but
will also be of very great service to old ones,
destroying the eggs of insects; and it should
be a constant practice, once in two or three
years, to bake them over again, and to have
the cases fresh washed with camphorated
spirit, or the sublimate solution, which would
not only preserve collections from decay,
much longer, but also keep them sweet.”
But Dr. Lettsom remarks that, “Baking is
apt to crimp and injure the plumage, unless
great care be used, and, therefore, the proper
degree of heat should be ascertained by means
of a feather, before such subjects are baked.”
And he prescribes as the best preservative,
boxes well glazed; and he adds, “When the
subject is to be kept for some time in a hot
climate, it should be secured in a box filled
with tow, oakum, or tobacco, well sprinkled
with the sublimate solution.” In Guiana, the
number and variety of beautiful birds is so
great, that several persons in the colony advantageously
employ themselves, with their
slaves and attendants, in killing and preserving
these animals for the cabinets of naturalists
in different parts of Europe. The method
of doing this, as related by Mr. Bancroft,
(in his Nat. Hist. of Guiana,) is, to put the
bird which is to be preserved in a proper vessel,
and cover him with high wines, or the
first running of the distillation of rum. In
this spirit he is suffered to remain for twenty-four
or forty-eight hours, or longer, till it
has penetrated through every part of his body.
When this is done, he is taken out, and his
feathers, which are no ways changed by this
immersion, are placed smooth and regular.
It is then put into a machine, made for the
purpose, among a number of others, and its
head, feet, wings, tail, &amp;c. are placed exactly
agreeable to life. In this position they are
placed in an oven, very moderately heated,
where they are slowly dried, and will ever
after retain their natural position without
danger of putrefaction.—<i>Ency. Lond.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Bitches should be allowed to breed, nor is it
good for their health to prevent it; for nature
almost invariably punishes extraordinary deviations
from her established laws, of which
the reproductive system is one of the most
important. Breeding, therefore, is so much a
healthy and necessary process, that bitches
prevented from it rarely remain unaffected by
disease. Bitches in heat are very cunning,
and often elude all but the greatest vigilance
in their attempts to escape in search of a mate;
and thus, for want of due caution, many frustrate
the hopes of their owners in the desired
breed; and many others meet their death by
becoming lined by a dog so extremely disproportionate
in size that the mothers are found
unable to bring forth. Impregnation takes
place sometimes at the first copulation, in
others not until the second, third, or fourth;
and in some cases it has been known, from
decided proofs, that impregnation did not
ensue until the seventh warding. Dogs should
be suffered, therefore, to remain together
some days to insure prolific intercourse. It
is not easy to detect whether bitches are in
pup until the fourth or fifth week after warding;
about which time the teats enlarge, the
flanks fill, and the belly assumes a fulness
and rotundity unnatural to it at others. Pupping
usually comes on the sixty-second, sixty-third,
or, at farthest, on the sixty-fourth day.
A quarter or half an hour, and sometimes a
longer time, intervenes between the expulsion
of each fœtus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dogs are certainly capable of superfœtation;
that is, impregnation may take place at more
than one warding, and that by distinct mates.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would appear that this mental impression,
which is perhaps usually raised at some
period of œstrum, always recurs at that period,
and is so interwoven with the organisation
even, as to become a stamp or mould for some,
if not all, of her future progeny. I had a pug
bitch whose constant companion was a small
and almost <i>white</i> spaniel dog, of Lord Rivers’
breed, of which she was very fond. When
it became necessary to separate her, on account
of her heat, from this dog, and to confine her
with one of her own kind, she pined excessively;
and notwithstanding her situation, it
was some time before she would admit of the
attentions of the pug dog placed with her. At
length, however, she did so; impregnation
followed, and at the usual period she brought
forth five pug puppies, one of which was elegantly
<i>white</i>, and more <i>slender</i> than the
others. The spaniel was soon afterwards given
away, but the impression remained; for at
two subsequent litters (which were all she had
afterwards) she presented me with a <i>white</i>
young one, which the fanciers know to be a
very rare occurrence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Rev. R. Lascelles, in his <i>Letters on
Sporting</i>, p. 250, relates a case of a greyhound
bitch, intrusted to the care of a servant,
which whelped one perfect greyhound
and six complete curs: the curs were the
likeness of the dog she domesticated with in
common; the single one resembled the greyhound
she was taken to during her heat. There
is little reason, therefore, to doubt that the
bitch had been previously lined by the cur,
and the single greyhound pup was the effect of
superfœtation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sportsmen incline to the opinion, that the
male pups are more strongly tinctured with
the external form of the father than of the
mother, and <i>vice versâ</i>; but though instances
may occur to favour such a conclusion, it is not
a uniform occurrence.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The bittern is nearly as large as the common
heron; its legs are stronger, body more
plump and fleshy, and its neck is more thickly
clothed with feathers. The beak is strong
at the base; straight, sharp on the edges, and
gradually tapers to an acute point; the upper
mandible is brown, the under inclining to
green; the mouth is wide, the gape extending
beyond the eyes, with a dusky patch at each
angle: the irides are yellow. The crown of
the head is somewhat depressed, and covered
with long black feathers; the throat is yellowish
white; the sides of the neck pale rust
colour, variegated with black, in spotted,
waved, and narrow transverse lines, and on
the forepart the ground colour is whitish, and
the feathers fall down in less broken and
darker lengthened stripes. These neck-feathers,
which it can raise and depress at
pleasure, are long and loose, and, inclining
backwards, cover the neck behind; those below
them, on the breast to the thighs, are
streaked lengthwise with black, edged with
yellowish white: the thighs, belly, and vent,
are of a dull pale yellow, clouded with dingy
brown. The plumage on the back and wings
is marked with black zigzag lines, bars, and
streaks, upon a ground shaded with rust colour
and yellow. The bastard wings, greater coverts,
and quills, are brown, barred with black.
The tail, which consists only of ten feathers,
is very short; the legs are of a pale green, bare
a little above the knees; the claws, particularly
those on the hind toes, are long and sharp,
the middle ones serrated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is less than the male; her plumage
is darker, and the feathers on her head,
breast, and neck, are shorter, and the colours
not so distinctly marked. She makes an artless
nest, composed chiefly of the withered
stalks and leaves of the high coarse herbage,
in the midst of which it is placed, and lays
from four to six eggs, of a greenish white
colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bittern is a shy solitary bird; it is never
seen on the wing in the day time, but sits,
commonly with the head erect, hid among
the reeds and rushes in the marshes, where it
always takes up its abode, and from whence it
will not stir, unless it is disturbed by the
sportsman. When it changes its haunts, it
removes in the dusk of the evening, and then
rising in a spiral direction, soars to a vast height.
It flies in the same heavy manner as the heron,
and might be mistaken for that bird, were it
not for the singularly resounding cry which it
utters from time to time while on the wing;
but this cry is feeble when compared to the
hollow booming noise which it makes during
the night time, in the breeding season, from its
swampy retreat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bittern, when attacked by the buzzard,
or other birds of prey, defends itself with great
courage, and generally beats off such assailants;
neither does it betray any symptoms of
fear, when wounded by the sportsman, but
eyes him with a keen undaunted look, and,
when driven to extremity, will attack him
with the utmost vigour, wounding his legs, or
aiming at his eyes with its sharp and piercing
bill. It was formerly held in much estimation
at the tables of the great, and is again recovering
its credit as a fashionable dish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Little Bittern, (<i>Ardea Minuta</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>Le Blongois</i>, <span class='sc'>Buf.</span>) in size is not much
larger than the throstle, measuring only about
fifteen inches in length. From the corners of
the mouth, a black stroke extends across the
under side of the cheeks; and a patch of black,
glossed with green and edged with chestnut,
covers the crown of its head. On the back,
rump, and scapulars, the feathers are dark
brown, edged with pale rusty coloured red;
the sides of the neck, and the breast are of the
same colours, but the brown on the middle of
each feather is in narrower streaks. The belly
is white: the hinder part of the neck is bare,
but the long feathers on the forepart lie back
and cover it. The tail is short, and of a black
green colour, edged and tipped with tawny:
the legs dirty green. The little bittern has
seldom been met with in Great Britain.</p>

stuff a very dark blue: then make a very
strong dye of strawall and walnut bark; boil
the wool in this for six hours. Take out
the stuff, and clean out the dye-pot, and
make a fresh dye of <i>strawall</i>, <i>logwood
dust</i>, or a good quantity of <i>chips</i>, with some
<i>madder</i> and <i>Brazil dust</i>: boil in this two
hours, and pour off your liquor. Clean your
pot, and put in liquor again with the stuff,
and when hot, pour in a quart of <i>urine</i>, at
least eight days’ old, and boil in this half an
hour. Having dissolved in some of the boiling
liquor the size of a hazel-nut of copperas,
lift out your stuff, and pour in this liquor—boil
it well, and all is done. If any brown or

light, put down some clean water, and boil it,
adding to it one, two, or three tea spoonfuls of

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blackbird</span>, <i>s.</i> The name of a bird.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of the blackbird, or ouzel,
(<i>Turdus Merula</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>—<i>Le Merle</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)
is generally about ten inches. Its plumage is
altogether black; the bill, inside of the mouth,
and edges of the eye-lids, are yellow, as are
also the soles of the feet; the legs are of a
dirty yellow. The female is mostly brown,
inclining to rust colour on the breast and
belly; the bill is dusky, and the legs brown;
its song is also very different, so that it has
sometimes been mistaken for a bird of a different
species.</p>

<p class='c006'>The males, during the first year, resemble
the females so much, as not easily to be distinguished
from them; but, after that, they
assume the yellow bill, and other distinguishing
marks of their kind. The blackbird is a
solitary bird, frequenting woods and thickets,
chiefly of evergreens, such as holly, pines,
firs, &amp;c., especially where there are perennial
springs, which together afford it both shelter
and subsistence. Wild blackbirds feed on
berries, fruits, insects, and worms; they never
fly in flocks like thrushes; they pair early,
and begin to warble nearly as soon as any
other of the songsters of the grove.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female builds her nest in bushes, or
low trees, and lays four or five eggs, of a
bluish green colour, marked irregularly with
dusky spots. The young birds are easily
brought up tame, and may be taught to whistle
a variety of tunes; for which their clear,
loud, and melodious tones are well adapted.
They are restless and timorous birds, easily
alarmed, and difficult of access. But Buffon
observes, that, “they are more restless
than cunning, and more timorous than suspicious,
as they readily suffer themselves to
be caught with bird-lime, nooses, and all sorts
of snares.” They are never kept in aviaries;
for, when shut up with other birds, they pursue
and harass their companions in slavery
unceasingly: for which reason they are generally
confined in cages apart. In some counties
of England, this bird is called simply the
Ouzel.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blackcap</span>, <i>s.</i> A small singing bird.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Black Cock</span>, <i>s.</i> (<i>Tetrao tetrix</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>) Known also as the heath-cock and
heath-poult.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species sometimes weighs as much as
four pounds; length about twenty-three inches,
bill dusky, irides hazel; the head, neck,
and whole body, are of glossy blue-black,
particularly about the neck, breast, and rump;
over the eye the bare scarlet skin is granulated;
the coverts of the wings dusky brown,
the four first quill feathers black, the next
white at the bottom, the lower half and tips
of the secondaries white, under wing coverts
white; the thighs are dark brown, sometimes
marked with a few white spots; the tail consists
of sixteen black feathers; the exterior
ones bend outwards, and are much longer than
those in the middle, which makes the tail
very forked; the under tail coverts pure
white; legs covered with hair-like feathers of
a dark brown, speckled with grey; toes pectinated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female weighs about two pounds; the
plumage is very different from that of the
male; the general colour is ferruginous, barred
and mottled, with black above, the under
parts paler, with dusky and brown bars; the
tail-feathers are straight and even at the end,
variegated with ferruginous and black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The black grous is at present confined to
the more northern parts of this kingdom, population
and culture having driven them from
the south, except in a few of the more wild,
uncultivated parts; in the New Forest in
Hampshire, Dartmoor and Sedgmoor in Devonshire,
and the heathy hills in Somersetshire,
contiguous to the latter. It is also
found in Staffordshire, and in North Wales,
and again in the North of England; but no
where so plentiful as in some parts of the
highlands of Scotland. The males are polygamous,
and fight desperately for the females.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the month of April the male places
himself on an eminence as soon as it is light
in the morning, crows and claps his wings, on
which the females resort to his station. After
the courting season the males associate peaceably
together, in small packs; are fond of
woody, heathy and mountainous situations;
but will occasionally visit the corn-fields in
the autumn, retiring almost wholly to the
woods in the winter, and perching on trees.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female lays six or seven dirty-white
eggs, blotched with rust-colour, about the
size of those of a pheasant. These are deposited
amongst the highest heath, without
much appearance of a nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young follow the female for some
time. The males are scarcely distinguishable
from the other sex till they are above half
grown, when the black feathers begin to appear
first about the sides and breast. Their
food is chiefly the tops of heath and birch,
except when the mountain berries are ripe, at
which time they devour bilberries and cranberries
most voraciously.</p>

<p class='c006'>A supposed hybrid bird of this species
has been described under the following synonimes:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Tetrao Hybridus, Tetra Tetrix, Spurious
Grous.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird has been described by Linnæus
and others as a distinct species, or mixed
breed between the black and wood grous. It
is said to differ from the black grous in having
reddish spots on the neck, breast, wings, and
thighs, and in being of a superior size. It is
said to have been formerly met with in Scotland.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The bleak is seldom more than six inches
long; the head is small, and the skull transparent;
the eyes are large, with a blood coloured
spot on the lower side; the irides of a
pale yellow; the under jaw the longest; the
gills silvery; the body is slender, greatly compressed
sideways, not unlike that of the sprat:
the back is green; the sides and belly silvery;
the fins pellucid; the lateral line rather crooked;
the scales are large, and fall off very easily;
the tail is much forked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some call the bleak the water swallow, on
account of its nimbleness in catching flies;
they are very restless, their haunts being sometimes
in deep still water, at the sides and tails
of streams, where the water shelves off, and
makes a gentle eddy; at others in the streams,
which may be observed by their swimming
near the surface, and their very active manner
of taking and diverting themselves with small
flies, and insects. In angling for the bleak,
the tackle must be very fine, with four or five
small hooks, so placed above each other as not
to entangle, and swimming by the assistance
of a small quill float, rather deeper than mid-water,
and baited variously, as with a gentle,
bloodworm, caddis, the house-fly, (or any fly
they are observed at the moment to feed upon,)
and a very small bit of red paste, throwing in
now and then some malt grains, or chewed
bread, to keep them together; always remembering,
wherever ground bait is used, it should
be inferior to the hook-baits: thus two or
three at a time may be taken, for they are so
eager as to leap out of the water at the bait.
Should the day be cold and cloudy, a single
gentle, or cadis, upon the hook is then best,
sunk about two foot under water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another way of taking bleak is by whipping
from a boat, or the bank-side in fresh streams,
with a rod six feet, and a line twice as long,
using an artificial black gnat, a fly of a very
sad brown colour, or the small dace-flies; they
not only yield much sport, but are very instructive
to the young fly-fisher.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bleed</span>, <i>v.</i> To lose blood; to run with blood; to drop as blood; to let
blood.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Bleeding.</i>—This operation is frequently
required in the diseases of horses; and if employed
seasonably, and to a sufficient extent,
is the most efficacious remedy we are acquainted
with. When a horse appears dull and
heavy, and indifferent about his food, by bleeding
we often prevent a fever. If a horse is
bled at the commencement of a cold, the complaint
generally proves moderate, and of short
continuance. In all cases of internal inflammation,
or symptomatic fever, bleeding is the
most essential remedy, provided the operation
be performed at an early period, and the blood
drawn in sufficient quantity. In such cases I
have often taken away six quarts or more, and
repeated the operation the same or the following
day when it appeared necessary. By bleeding
copiously at first, those formidable diseases
are crushed at once; while by suffering them
to proceed or become at all violent, which they
will do unless this practice is adopted (or if
only a small quantity of blood is drawn), they
generally prove fatal: nor will bleeding then
be of any service.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bleeding is either general or local: that is,
it is done either so as to affect the system in
general, or a particular part only. For general
bleeding, the jugular or neck vein is most
convenient.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the vein is firmly pressed with the
fingers of the left hand, the blood is prevented
from descending, and that part of the vein
which is above the fingers is considerably distended,
and becomes very conspicuous. In
this state it may be easily opened with a lancet
held in the right hand. The vein will
continue to bleed as long as the pressure below
is continued.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farriers bleed with a <i>fleam</i>, which, though
apparently a clumsy method of operating, is
certainly safer than the lancet in unskilful
hands. In topical bleeding, a vein is chosen
as near as possible to the affected part, or the
vessels covering the part are opened: in the
inflammation of the eye, for example, it is
done by scarifying the inner surface of the eyelid,
or by opening a small vein which is easily
seen going from the inner corner of the eye
towards the nose. I do not think, however,
that either of these operations do any good;
indeed that of scarifying the eyelids is often,
I believe, injurious.</p>

<p class='c006'>A graduated tin vessel, capable of containing
six or seven quarts, is very convenient for
the purpose of receiving the blood; every pint
being marked on the inside of the vessel, so
that the quantity of blood that is taken off
may be exactly known. The blood should
always be preserved, that we may judge from
its appearance of the nature of the disease, and
whether it is proper or not to repeat the operation.
When it continues fluid a considerable
time, it denotes an inflammatory state of
the system. Should a whitish or light buff-coloured
jelly appear on its surface, after it has
coagulated or settled, and should this jelly be
of considerable thickness, rather firm, not easily
penetrated by the finger, we may be satisfied
that the horse’s complaint is inflammatory;
that bleeding was a proper remedy; and that,
if the symptoms continue, the operation may
be repeated with advantage: but if the blood
coagulates quickly, is uniformly of a dark liver
colour, loose and easily broken, with a
considerable quantity of water upon its surface,
it denotes debility, and shows that the disease
arises from a weakness of the system; that
instead of <i>bleeding</i>, <i>tonic</i> and <i>cordial</i> medicines
are to be employed, with every thing that
may tend to restore the animal’s strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to judge correctly by the appearance
of the blood, it should be drawn from a
large orifice, and not suffered to run down the
sides of the vessel which receives it. The first
quantity that is drawn should be put aside for
examination, and not shaken or disturbed in
any way until it has perfectly coagulated.</p>

<p class='c006'>When bleeding is employed as a preventive,
or in any slight complaints, from two to
three quarts may be taken off, according to
the horse’s strength and condition; but in
cases of internal inflammation, or fever, a
more copious evacuation is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>When horses are taken from camp or grass,
and put into warm stables, they are very subject
to inflammatory complaints and dangerous
fevers: under those circumstances, moderate
bleeding now and then will prevent
such diseases. Horses that are getting into
condition, as it is termed, are liable to similar
disorders, unless moderate bleeding is occasionally
employed. I am inclined to believe,
however, that it is a bad practice to bleed
often upon trifling occasions; it is liable to induce
a plethora or fulness of habit, whereby
a horse is rendered more susceptible of disease
than he would otherwise be. Moderate
purging and regular exercise, with a proper
regulation of diet and temperature, are fully
adequate to the prevention of disease on those
occasions; but these are too often neglected.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been asserted that it is seldom necessary
to pin up the orifice, which is made in the
skin by bleeding. I grant there is not often
any danger to be apprehended from its bleeding
again; but unless it is pinned up, that is,
unless the lips of the wound are brought into
contact, and kept in that situation, by passing
a pin through the edges of the skin, and
twisting a little tow round it, as is generally
done by farriers, inflammation and swelling
will sometimes take place in the wound, and
matter will form in consequence. The fleam
has been found upon many occasions, particularly
for opening the neck vein, a better instrument
than the lancet; the latter makes
an orifice in the skin, scarcely larger than the
vein; and as the horse is generally a little
restless, the blood soon gets between the skin
and the vein, plugging up the orifice in the
latter, and sometimes diffusing itself in the
cellular membrane, so as to cause a swelling.
The lancet, however, in skilful hands is a
neater method, and more convenient for
horses that are very shy and difficult to be
bled in the common way.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Dogs may be conveniently bled by the jugular
or neck vein, with a fleam, or with a
common lancet; but the latter is much preferable.
A ligature being put round the lower
part of the neck, and the head being held up,
the vein will swell and protrude itself on each
side of the windpipe, about one inch from it.
It will, however, be necessary previously to cut
the hair away, if it be very thick; after which,
the puncture can be easily made with a lancet,
the operator leaning over the dog. Nothing is
necessary, in general cases, to stop the bleeding,
but to remove the ligature; nor is any pin,
plaister, or bandage, requisite for the orifice.
When circumstances such as the want of a
regular operator, or when the amateur is called
on to deplete his own dog suddenly, as in
the field, when the means of venesection by
the neck are not at hand; in any such case the
ear may be punctured, or an incision may be
made on the inner side of the flap of it, choosing,
if possible, the course of a vein for the
puncture, but avoid passing the instrument
through the ear. Or the tail may be cut in
desperate cases; but, when this is done, it is
better to cut off a small piece than to merely
make an incision underneath; for I have seen,
when this has been injudiciously done, the
whole tail in a state of mortification.</p>

<p class='c006'>The quantity of blood drawn should be regulated
by the size of the dog: for a very small
dog, one or two ounces are sufficient; for a
middling sized dog, three or four ounces; and
for a large dog, five, six, seven, or eight ounces,
according to the size and strength of the
patient, and the nature of the disease he labours
under.—<i>White.</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blister</span>, <i>s.</i> A pustule formed by raising the cuticle from the cutis; any
swelling made by the separation of a film or skin from the other parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Blisters are medicines that inflame the skin,
and cause watery bladders to rise upon its
surface: the most useful of this kind is the
cantharis, or Spanish fly, (<i>lytta vesicatoria</i>)
which forms the principal ingredient in all our
blisters. There are others, however, which
are generally mixed with it as auxiliaries; as
hellebore, euphorbium, turpentine, and sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Blisters are much used in veterinary medicine,
and are extremely efficacious in dispersing
callous swellings, the consequence of
strains, bruises, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>In inflammation of parts remote from the
surface, they are of great service. When the
internal parts of the foot are inflamed, relief
is generally obtained by blistering the pastern,
provided the subordinate or auxiliary remedies
are not omitted, such as paring the sole,
soaking the horny part of the foot in warm
water, or applying a poultice to it, and giving
a dose of physic. When the lungs are inflamed,
blistering the sides freely is an excellent
remedy, especially when we feel doubtful
as to the propriety of further bleeding.</p>

<p class='c006'>Blistering is employed also for curbs, windgalls,
spavins, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>Broken knees, unless skilfully treated,
leave a callous swelling on the part; for the
removal of which, blistering is employed.
When blisters are properly made, and free
from any caustic ingredients, such as sublimate,
vitriolic acid, &amp;c., there is no danger of
destroying the hair; and if the first blistering
does not prove effectual, it may be repeated
until the desired effect is produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before a blister is applied, the hair should
be closely cut off, or even shaved off, if the
situation of the diseased part will admit of its
being done without wounding the skin; but
good scissors, or shears, if skilfully used, will
answer the purpose sufficiently. If the skin
is scurfy it may be washed with flannel, soap,
and warm water, and be made perfectly dry
before the blister is applied. Blisters are generally
employed in the form of ointment, but
on some occasions they are preferred of a
thinner consistence, or in the form of liniment,
or even still thinner or more fluid, and
are then named liquid blisters. Though a
variety of ingredients are used in blisters,
the cantharis or Spanish fly is the best; and
if not injured by long keeping, or adulterated,
is the only blistering ingredient required for
common purposes.</p>

applied to a small surface only, as in bone
spavin or splent. Neither the cantharides nor
the calomel, or sublimate, should be kept

<p class='c006'>After a blister has been applied to the legs
or hocks, the litter should be removed, and
the horse’s head should be confined or tied to
the rack, to prevent his rubbing the part with
his nose; but this may be done better by
putting what is termed a cradle or necklace
round his neck; he may then be turned loose
into a box and exercise himself, which is very
desirable after blistering. It is necessary to
keep the cradle on for about a fortnight, as
they are apt to gnaw the part or injure the
skin, when the effect of the blister is going
off, and an itching only remains.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is a convenient method of
making a blister, when the other ingredients
cannot be obtained:—Take of the blistering
plaster, sold by druggists, two ounces, melt
or rather soften it by a gentle heat, and mix
with it oil of turpentine from half an ounce
to one ounce.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Blistered Heel.</i>—If your heel should become
galled by walking in a water, or any
other boot, you will immediately remedy the
inconvenience by applying a piece of gold-beater’s
skin, and over that a little court
plaster, in order doubly to defend the part.
But even in this trifle there is a right and
wrong way of going to work. Instead of cutting
with scissors, and merely wetting the
plaster, let it be for a moment heated by the
fire, as well as wetted, being previously stamped
with a wadding punch; by which means, from
having no angles, or corners, it will stick as
fast as your own skin; provided that, when
on and dry, you put over it a little cold cream,
or any kind of grease, in order to repel the
damp.</p>

<p class='c006'>The application that has been usually recommended
to me by surgeons is a diachylon
plaster, which, in cold weather, curls up and
torments you so much in walking, that you
soon become lame again, and then wish the
doctor at Jericho. Go to Godfrey’s or some
other first-rate chemist, in order to get the
sticking plaster in perfection, as many a one
has poisoned his skin by not having the genuine
article.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old man proceeded skilfully enough;
he lanced the blisters, and then applied the
cuticle which covers a sheep’s kidney, and
which is very similar in appearance and effect
to what we call “gold-beaters’ leaf.” This
application prevented the heel from being
frayed by the stocking. To the remainder of
the foot, he rubbed a hot mixture of tallow
and whiskey; and his remedy was “the sovereignest
thing on earth,” for in twelve hours
the cure was effected.—<i>White</i>—<i>Hawker</i>—<i>Blaine</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blood</span>, <i>s.</i> The red liquor that circulates in the bodies of animals.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blood</span>, <i>v.</i> To stain with blood; to inure to blood, as a hound.</p>

<p class='c006'>In essential characters and properties, blood
is the same in all animals: in some, it wants
the colouring matter, but it is invariably red
in the higher orders, though the intensity of
its hue varies with circumstances, the principal
instance of which is that afforded between
the venous and arterial; where it is, in the
former, almost purple, but in the latter a
bright scarlet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The specific gravity of the blood is very
differently estimated, it being subject to increase
and decrease at different times. Disease
and emaciation make it lighter, while in
the contrary states, from its more perfect organisation,
it is found heavier. If water be
estimated at 1000, the specific gravity of
blood may be reckoned at 1050; from which
it may, however, be increased to 1120. Venous
blood is heavier than arterial, as 1052 is
to 1049; but these data vary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The temperature of the blood in the horse
is about 100°; in the ox, 102; and in the
sheep, 103: but various circumstances tend
to increase or decrease it. Arterial blood is
usually one or two degrees warmer than
venous: Mr. Vines, I believe, rates the difference
much higher. Some diseases reduce
the heat of the blood, and ardent inflammations
are also capable of augmenting it. The
quantity that an animal contains, in proportion
to his bulk, has been endeavoured to be
ascertained: but the results have been various.
Very fat animals are found usually to
have proportionally less than lean ones; and
in those in a state of close confinement, the
quantity is found to be smaller than in the
wild; but it is evident, that as the calculation
must be in a degree imaginary, from that
which will remain in the vessels, so the real
quantity is not easy to estimate. A medium
sized horse has lost forty-four pounds without
apparent injury, and most of them will lose one-fifteenth
of their total weight before life becomes
extinct: it may, therefore, be presumed
that it forms one-tenth of the whole:
Mr. Percivall thinks one-eighth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blood-hound</span> (<i>Canis Sanguinarius</i>), <i>s.</i> A hound that follows by the
scent.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the darker ages the blood-hound had the
fabulous reputation of pursuing naturally with
unerring precision, and of taking murderers,
robbers, and other depredators, if he were laid
on the footsteps of those intended to be pursued,
within a certain given time. We, however,
cannot give our assent to the character
thus ascribed to him, although experience has
taught us, that all sorts of hounds may be
broken in to follow any kind of scent, when resolutely
taught that they are to run on no other.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the principal uses in which the blood-hound
was employed by our ancestors, was in
recovering game that had escaped wounded
from the hunter. And he was taught also to
pursue felons, which he would do through
thickets, and the most secret coverts; and, if
they had lately escaped, they were almost certain
of being retaken. For this reason there
was a law in Scotland, enacting, that whoever
denied entrance to one of these dogs, in pursuit
of stolen goods, should be deemed an accessory.
And they were also much used on
the borders, between England and Scotland,
which were greatly infested by robbers and
murderers; and a tax was laid on the inhabitants
for keeping and maintaining a certain
number of these animals. The arm of justice
is now, however, so effectually extended over
Great Britain, and cultivation so general, that
there are no secret haunts where villany can
be concealed; which renders this part of the
services of the blood-hound no longer necessary.
In Scotland this dog was called the
sleuth-hound. A few of this race are still kept
in the royal forests for the purpose of finding
deer that have been previously wounded; and
even lately they have been employed in tracing
deer-stealers, which they do from the blood
which issues from the wounds of the animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The blood-hound is tall and most beautifully
formed, and is usually of a reddish or
brown colour, and exceeds in size, weight,
strength, and courage, every other variety of
hound. He possesses a kind of sagacious, or
serious solemn dignity, admirably calculated
to impress the marauder with dread and awe;
and at one period, when he was destined to a
single pursuit, he was kept a stranger to every
other. Much care was taken to prevent those
dogs from following the sports of the field, and
they were scrupulously taught to trace the
footsteps of man alone. At the time they
were so much in use, deer-stealing was extremely
prevalent in Great Britain, which rendered
a constant vigilance on the part of park-keepers,
necessary; and when necessity required,
in their nocturnal watching, to trace a
depredator, when once laid upon the scent,
they so closely and keenly pursued, that they
infallibly traced and discovered the offending
party. Somerville finely describes the manner
in which these animals pursue the nightly
poacher.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>To try whether a young blood-hound was
well instructed, a nobleman caused one of his
servants to walk to a town four miles from
thence. The dog, without seeing the man he
was to pursue, followed him by the scent to
the above-mentioned places, notwithstanding
the multitude of people going the same road,
and of travellers that had occasion to cross it.
When the hound came to the chief market-town,
he passed through the streets, without
noticing any of the people there, till he got to
the house where the man he sought was, and
there found him in an upper room.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Blood-hounds were formerly employed by
the Spanish chasseurs in the island of Cuba,
for hunting down maroons and fugitive slaves.
Mr. Dallas thus describes them:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The dogs carried out by the Chasseurs del
Ré are perfectly broken in, that is to say, they
will not kill the object they pursue, unless
resisted. On coming up with a fugitive, they
bark at him till he stops; they then crouch
near him, terrifying him with a ferocious
growling, if he stirs. In this position they
continue barking, to give notice to the chasseurs,
who come up and secure their prisoner;
each chasseur, though he can hunt only with
two dogs, properly is obliged to have three,
which he maintains at his own cost, and that
at no small expense. These people live with
their dogs, from which they are inseparable.
At home the dogs are kept chained, and,
when walking with their masters, are never
unmuzzled, or let out of ropes, but for attack.
They are constantly accompanied with one or
two small dogs, called finders, whose scent
is very keen, and always sure of hitting off a
track. Dogs and bitches hunt equally well,
and the Chasseurs rear no more than will
supply the number required. This breed of
dogs, indeed, is not so prolific as the common
kind, though infinitely stronger and hardier.
The animal is the size of a very large hound,
with ears erect, which are usually cropped at
the points; the nose more pointed, but widening
very much towards the upper part of the
jaw. His coat, or skin, is much harder than
that of most dogs, and so must be the whole
structure of the body, as the severe beatings
he undergoes in training would kill any other
species of dog. There are some, but not
many, of a more obtuse nose, and which are
rather squarer set. These, it may be presumed,
have been crossed by the mastiff; but
if by this the bulk has been a little increased,
it has added nothing to the strength, height,
beauty, or agility, of the native breed.”—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Boyle</i>—<i>Dallas.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Blue</span>, <i>a.</i> One of the seven original colours.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye Blues and Greens.</i>—You must
have two pickling crocks that well hold eight
quarts each; fill them with clean urine, let
them stand for eight days. Pound two ounces
of Spanish indigo, separate. Put it into a
small flannel bag, each ounce; put a bag into
each crock, and carefully squeeze out the
indigo; let it stand two or three days; stir
it each day, and when you see a shining scum
on it, it is in order to work. It will dye feathers,
mohair, or hog’s fur; any hackles, or
fur dyed with this must be brightened with
a solution of liquid blue made with boiling
water, with a little of the liquid poured
into it for each shade.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To make liquid blue.</i>—A pound of the
oil of vitriol and an ounce of the best Spanish
indigo pounded very fine and sifted; pour the
vitriol into a three-pint delft bowl, put the indigo
in, and stir it with a clean stick for half-an-hour;
add of soft water by little and little
one pint, stirring it all the time till the fermentation
is over; then bottle it for use. This
gives the finest blues and greens, <i>but they
fade</i>; you are not to touch your blueing vat
with any thing that is yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>For blues.</i>—You ought to get the finest
of whites, and prepare them well; have the
urine vat in good order. Stir up the vat,
throw in the feathers in as many bunches as
you intend to have shades; lift them out now
and then to strike the air. When a middling
bright blue, take out a bunch; let the second
lie in for double the time and more, and air
them as directed. When you see a fine full
blue, take out another bunch. You may let
the third bunch lay in for two or three days;
but as soon as you take out each bunch, you
should have about six drops of solution blue
in a bowl with a pint of boiling water; rinse
them well in that, and it will clean them.
If you see it wants it, add in a few drops more,
and it will still add to the brightness. Put
them instantly into cold water, and wash them
well. Do the same three or four times; thus
you will have fine deep blues, bright and fast.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Powder blues.</i>—Follow the same process,
but do not leave them till done; draw and
air them every half-hour; and when of a
proper colour, have some boiling water, and
from four to six drops of solution to rise and
brighten them; and if you see it requires
it, add a few drops more. Wash, &amp;c., as
before.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>A very bright blue.</i>—Ground richly with
an archill. Wash in stale urine; put your feathers
into the urine vat for half-an-hour; take
out and air them, and do as with all the rest.

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Boot</span>, <i>s.</i> A covering for the leg.</p>

<p class='c006'>All boots for going in the wet, answer much
better if kept at least half a year before they
are worn; and they should afterwards never
be suffered to get too hard. Water boots
should be invariably worn over an extra pair
of coarse yarn stockings, without which you
do not give them a fair trial.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far from being hard to the feet, they are
the softest possible wear, and may be made
very light. They should always be made to
draw, when required, very far above the
knees, in order to protect them from cold or
wet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various dressings are recommended, though,
perhaps, almost any grease may answer; but
the first and most effectual application might
be tar, tallow, and bees’ wax, melted, (not
too warm) and then poured into the boots;
which, after having this shaken into every
part of them, should be hung up to let it run
out. By this dressing, and the sacrifice of
the first pair of stockings that follows it, we
may walk in the river with more comfort than
a Bond-street lounger would cross the street
after a shower.</p>

<p class='c006'>This recipe, however, though a double
defence, I do not mean to say is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>As another good recipe, I should prefer the

<p class='c006'>Melt those over a slow fire, and then add a
few drachms of essential oil of lavender (or
thyme). With this your boots are to be

some distance from the fire. The application

ounces of amber varnish, which, when well

adopted by many gentlemen who use the cross-bow
for that purpose, and since upon the
proper regulation of this instrument, the whole
of its execution depends, directions are therefore
here given to render it useful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cross-bows employed formerly as weapons
in war, and also to kill animals in the field,
(where great nicety of vision was required, to
find those sorts of game that kept upon the
ground, for the cross-bow was always used at
motionless objects), were of somewhat the
shape as those of the present day, at least those
that now throw what is termed a bolt. The
bullet-bows are of modern and much neater
construction, and their accuracy, when once set,
is astonishing; the splitting a ball upon the
edge of a knife, however extraordinary it may
sound, is to be performed by a novice, at a distance
of from fifteen to twenty yards, and the
bow, once regulated, will throw the ball with
the same unerring certainty for fifty times successively.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Directions.</i>—When shooting where the
trees are lofty, try the bow at fourteen yards
upon a level, stopping all the holes in the sight
but one; if it shoots too high, raise the bead
higher on the fork; if too low, the contrary:
should it carry to the right, turn the bead
round to the right; if to the left, the contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the ball does not come within the
notches of the fork, open another hole in the
sight; if it shoots too high, open one lower; if
too low, the reverse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should the spring within the lock happen
to fail, take care to place the open part of the
new one toward the butt end of the bow; if it
be put in the wrong end forward, the bow will
be useless.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never keep the bow long in full tension,
rather shoot the ball waste.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the string frets or unravels, close up the
defective places with bees-wax.</p>

<p class='c006'>Care is necessary to hold the bow steady in
charging; if let slip whilst drawing up the
string, it will assuredly break the stock, and
probably the lath and string at the same time.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The bowels of the dog are very frequently
disordered. Dysentery, as an idiopathic affection
in dogs, is very rare; but an irritation
productive of morbid and inordinate mucous
discharge is produced by various causes. A
principal one is the consequence of long-continued
diarrhæa, which is so common to
distemper. Another is the result of bilious
inflammation. A third cause is the introduction
of poisons. Super-purgation will bring
it on, as noticed with enteritis and diarrhæa:
the presence of worms will likewise occasion
it.—See <span class='sc'>Worms</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Brag</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Brag</i> is not so much in vogue as formerly;
it is played with a whole pack of cards, and
rather variously conducted by different parties,
but the following is given as one of the
most scientific methods:—As many persons
as the cards, leaving a few for stock, will supply,
may play at a time, all of whom are to
lay down three stakes a piece, one for the best
whist card turned up in the deal; the second
for the best brag-hand, and the third for the
eldest hand obtaining thirty-one, or the next
number under that. The dealer is to give
three cards at once to every player turning up,
all round, the last card belonging to each
player, and the best card reckoning from ace
downwards amongst those so turned up, wins
the first stake; if two or more superior cards
of a sort be turned up, the eldest hand, of
course, has the preference, except in case of
the ace of diamonds, which at this part of the
game takes place of every other.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second stake is won by the person
possessing the best brag-hand, or often rather
by the boldest bragger, who sometimes only
pretends to hold good cards, such as pairs,
flushes, sequences of flushes, and so on, similar
to cribbage, excepting fifteens. In this
state of the game there are usually two favourite
cards; viz. the knave of clubs and the
nine of diamonds, which are reckoned with
any others to form pairs-royal or pairs; that
is, the two favourites combined together with
one, or either of them with two aces, kings,
&amp;c., are styled a pair royal of such cards, or
singly, either of the favourites with another
card ranks as a pair; only natural pairs-royal
are to precede artificial ones, as three aces,
kings, &amp;c., take place before a pair-royal,
formed by assistance of the two favourites,
though a natural pair does not supersede an
artificial one made by the help of a favourite,
into which situation only the knave of clubs
is admitted by some companies. The principal
sport of the game is occasioned by any
player <i>bragging</i> that he holds a better hand
than the rest of the party, which is declared
by saying, <i>I brag</i>, and staking a sum of
money; if no one answer by a similar or
larger deposit, then the bragger wins the
second stake; but should any one reply,
either by putting down the same or a greater
sum, and the first bragger decline the contest,
the answerer then takes both the money put
down and the second stake: should the first
bragger go on, and he says <i>Again</i>, and ventures
another sum, whether similar to that
laid down by the opponent or not, is of no
consequence, provided it is not smaller; and
if the other should reply in like manner <i>again</i>,
the parties continue betting, each putting down
a sum not less than that last ventured by his
adversary, till one or other of them, frightened,
gives up the contest, by which the player
holding out longest gains all the money wagered,
including the second stake; or either
party may lay down a stake, saying, <i>Let me
see you</i>, or <i>I’ll see it</i>, in which case both the
hands are to be shown, and the strongest
wins. When more than one person wishes to
answer the first bragger, the eldest has the
preference.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third stake is obtained by the eldest
player, who may hold, either from the cards
dealt, or obtain by drawing in addition from
the stock, thirty-one, or the highest number
under that; each ace, king, queen, and knave
being calculated as ten, and the rest according
to their pips; any one drawing above thirty-one
loses of course.</p>

<p class='c006'>The player who is so fortunate as to gain
all the three stakes in one deal, is, strictly
speaking, entitled to three more from each of
his antagonists, though in some companies
this is declined, as savouring too much of
gambling.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Breaking Dogs.</i>—There are three kinds
commonly used in shooting; the setter, the
pointer, and the spaniel. It is not designed in
this work to enter into minute directions for
breaking them; that is a province few gentlemen
choose to undertake, and very properly
have their dogs made to understand their
business, before they will take them into the
field; however, a method will be here concisely
mentioned, and which the experience of
one, who has broke as many, and as capital
dogs as any man of his age, in this or any
other country, always led him to adopt.</p>

<p class='c006'>For breaking a pointer or setter, get a check
collar, with a line nearly twenty yards long.
Peg the dog down, and give him the word
(“Take heed!”) or any other, make him
drop, and let him lay a quarter of an hour,
walking round, and using the word; afterwards
walk up and give him a small piece of
cheese. Take the dog upon a slack line, drop
him, and act as above every morning for a
fortnight, until he perfectly knows the word;
then hunt him at first single; when on a
strong haunt of birds, use the word, and stop
him; reward him as above with a piece of
cheese, and so encourage him until he knows
his game: serve each dog in the same way
for fourteen days; then take two or three dogs
upon check collars, peg down one before the
other, give the word, and make them back
each other four mornings successively; afterwards
hunt them together.</p>

<p class='c006'>To teach pointers or setters to bring their
game, get a rabbit’s skin stuffed; begin by
throwing it in a room, and let the dog have
a small line on his collar; when he takes
up the skin, bring him to you with a gentle
pull, with the skin in his mouth; encourage
him three or four times, and then take
the line off; when the dog begins to enjoy it,
take a small line and run it through a pulley
fixed at the top of a room; tie the rabbit’s
skin to one end of the line, keep the other
in hand, fire a pistol, and let the skin drop;
the dog will soon be fond of the sport, and
readily bring every head of game that is shot.
Break all the dogs in this way, and then take
two or three together into a room, fire the
pistol, and order first one, and then another
dog, to bring the skin, and they will soon be
perfect.</p>

<p class='c006'>To break a wild spaniel, fasten a wide
leather strap, about four feet long, to his collar,
with a swivel; this he will tread on, and
throw himself over, and will, by that means,
soon be checked, and rendered handy and
obedient. Spaniels may be taught to bring
the game by the same mode of instruction as
the pointers or setters; there should, however,
be but one spaniel in a team that does
this; if more, they will break the game in
struggling which shall carry it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The keepers in the west of Ireland commonly
break their dogs by using a pole of
about five feet long perforated with a small
bicket, about a foot from the end—to this
bicket they affix the <i>check-collar</i>, and by
pegging the dog down, secure him at his point
as long as they please. By reversing the pole
when it is necessary to chastise the animal for
misconduct, the dog is effectually secured from
escape or resistance; and, with this simple apparatus,
an Irish breaker will stop the wildest
setter, and subdue the most refractory.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some sportsmen, however, object to the use
of the pole on the score of severity, and allege
that timid dogs are frequently blinked by using
it. But for a violent setter, nothing will conquer
his obstinacy so soon or so effectually as
this implement.—<i>Thornhill, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bream</span>, <i>s.</i> The name of a fish.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The bream is a well-known fish, and yields
good diversion to the angler; it is found in slow
running, deep rivers, but is chiefly met with
in extensive ponds, where, although it grows
tardily, it will attain the weight of three or
four pounds (they have been known to weigh
eight), and if the water and air suit him, will
get very fat: they are great breeders, for it is
observed the melter has two melts, and the
spawner two large bags of spawn, from which
is deposited upwards of 130,000 ova. Very
few wish to stock their waters with them, as
they increase so rapidly, as to consume all the
sweet feed, and starve other fish, and are only
fit to be put into ponds as food for pike,
perch, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bream is broad, with a small head,
smooth at the top, big eyes, a small leather
mouth, no teeth, but a lozenge-like bone to
help its grinding; the palate is soft and fleshy,
resembling that of the carp; it is covered
with curious net-work scales, on which it
sometimes has abundance of minute whitish
tubercles; has a hog back, of a colour between
blue and black; the sides of the largest
are yellowish, and the belly, inclining to red,
is extremely deep, and thin in proportion to
its length; the tail is very large, and something
in the form of a crescent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The flesh is soft and clammy, yet by some
reckoned of easy digestion, and of better
nourishment than that of a carp; the choice
parts are the belly and head; what renders it
unpleasant for the table is the multitude of
bones, and the best way of preparing him is
by pickling it like salmon. The French,
however, esteem this fish highly, and proverbially
say, “he that hath breams in his pond
is able to bid his friend welcome.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The baits used are the red paste; also
paste made of brown bread and honey, gentles,
waspings, flag-worms; and they are great
lovers of red-worms, especially such as are
found at the root of a great dock, and lie
wrapt up in a round clue: the common red-worms
should be used two small ones at a
time. Green flies under water, the grasshopper
with the legs cut off in June and July;
but the best bait for the full-grown bream is
a large red worm without a knot, which is to
be found in garden walks or chalky commons
after rain; put the worms with moss well
washed and picked, and the water squeezed
from it, into an earthen pot set dry; change
the moss every four days for three weeks;
they will then be clear, lively, and at the
best.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following directions have been generally
given for taking the bream, and as being
also equally certain of tempting that shy fish
the carp. The bait to be a large red worm,
the rods long; the lines silk, or silk and hair,
and the floats, goose or swan quills; a piece
of lead of the form of an upright brass weight,
with a hole at the top, is to be fastened to
the low end of the lines; then fasten the
hook-link also to the lead, allowing ten inches
or a foot between lead and hook, which should
be No. 4: the lead must be sufficiently heavy
to sink the float quite level with the surface,
and not for the float to bear up the lead,
which must lie on the ground; by which
means the worm will crawl up and down so
far as the lead will allow, which to the fish is
a great enticement. The line for two yards
at bottom should be of strong round gut, and
the link next the hook as small as you dare
use, for fear of pike or perch (who will
assuredly visit the hooks), and till they are
taken, neither carp or bream will come near
to bite: this fineness will admit the worm to
draw the hook to and fro with less difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the ground-bait, get a peck, or peck
and a half, according to the greatness of stream
and depth of water, of sweet gross ground malt,
or unground wheat, which is thought preferable;
boil it very little, and strain it through
a bag: when cold, at night, cast in two parts
of it squeezed hard between the hands, so that
it may rest in the precise spot where you mean
to angle; and if this be repeated for two or three
times, it will more certainly attract the fish.
Recollect in a stream, to throw it at least a
yard above the place where you mean your
hook to be, or the stream will carry it too far
down; some sew worms for the fish to feed on,
upon a turf of short grass, nearly to cover the
turf, which is then fastened to a round board,
with a hole through that and the turf, where
a cord runs, and is tied to a pole to let down to
the bottom. Bream generally choose the broadest
and deepest part of a river, and in hot weather
are easily seen swimming in shoals; there,
or thereabouts, with a clear bottom, take the
exact depth, making some mark that shall explain
if any rise or fall has taken place in consequence
of watermills, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ground thus baited, the worms and
tackling prepared, by three or four in the morning,
with great caution approach the place, so
as not to be seen by the fish; some of them
are frequently at the top of the water, whilst
the rest are feeding beneath. Having baited
the hook that the worm can move at bottom,
cast it, and by drawing it gently to you, let
the lead rest about the middle of the ground
bait; a second rod should be a yard or two
above, and a third a yard or two below it; retire
from the water so far as just to perceive
the top of the floats; when there is a bite the
top of the float will sink suddenly; remain
quiet until the line goes clear away, then creep
to the water-side, and give as much line as
possible; if it be a good carp or bream it will
go to the farther side of the river, strike gently,
and hold the rod at the proper bend, that it
may tire him; for if both pull together, either
line, hook, or hold, will break, and the fish
will be lost. The bream is strong, and runs
hard when first struck; but after two or three
turns, he will fall on his side, which enables
you easily to land him: the carp is far stronger
and more mettlesome than the bream; it is
advisable to use a reel upon the rods for carp,
barbel, or bream; the length of line kills the
fish with ease, and increases the angler’s
amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sport may be continued from four till
eight in the morning, and from four until the
same hour in the evening. The following
morning, for the same hours, your diversion
will be perhaps the best; if it is gloomy and
windy, they will bite all day long, especially if
the water is a little thick after rains; during
the time of fishing, and at that of quitting the
water, throw in more of the ground-bait.
After two or three days, the place should be
baited and left quiet; the fish will otherwise
get too cunning to touch the hook-bait.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another mode of catching the bream, is,
after plumbing the depth, put one or more shot
a foot below the float, to balance it, which is a
way to take the shyest fish; the bait a large
red-worm, which must be laid in, and let sink
very gradually to the ground-bait. When the
fish bites, strike gently that very instant.</p>

<p class='c006'>A third is the running line, with a bullet
and hole through it, and a small shot to hinder
the bullet falling on the hook; let this
run on the bottom with the current into holes,
and equally as for the bream, it will be found
to answer for all other fish that bite at the
bottom.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Breeding Dogs.</i>—Never breed from an
old dog and old bitch; if one party must be
aged, it had better be the latter; but age on
either side should be avoided if possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Winter whelps of all sorts of dogs are best,
although the difficulty in rearing the produce
and the loss of the use of the bitch for some
weeks, are strong reasons against it, in the
opinion of many; but the few that survive
and are reared, amply recompense these obstacles.
At three or four days old, part of
the sterns should be twisted off, and the dew
claws be cut off with a sharp pair of scissors.
Puppies will soon learn to lap milk, which
will relieve the mother; at six weeks old
they may be separated, and should then be
wormed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dog, to be complete in his form,
should have round small feet, legs strong,
straight, and muscular; the shoulders fall
properly into the back, not upright; chest let
down; loins good; back not too long; elbows
play finely in their action, and come well in;
thighs and gaskings broad and strong.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In our selection of parents for multiplying
a breed a variety of circumstances should necessarily
engage our attention; as, whether we
are continuing a race already established, improving
a defective one, or altogether forming
a new variety. In either case, but particularly
in the two latter, one or two propagations
are not sufficient to enable us to judge
of the merits or demerits of the products:
anomalies may occur, monstrosities appear, or
dogs may breed <i>back</i>. It should likewise be
always present to us, that, in despite of all
our care, and in face of the most favourable
opportunities for selection, still <i>perfect specimens</i>
to propagate from are unattainable; and
as, therefore, we are necessarily to expect
defects, it should be our care to well examine
that we do not select our male and female
parents with each the same faulty form or
property; for, however perfect they may be
in other respects, they are, in such a case,
totally unfit to breed from together. We
may, for instance, suppose an otherwise eligible
pair of pointers, of the purest blood, but
that each, from early and constant confinement,
had contracted long, weak, spreading
phalanges or toes, instead of a round, cat-like
form of foot. By choosing a mate for each of
these whose feet were unusually small, round,
and firm, we might remedy this defect, and
preserve their excellencies; but it would be
only propagating deformity to breed from
them together. We can only expect to prove
successful in rearing a superior race of any
domestic animal, when we make our selection
of parents with a careful reference to the
merits and defects in each, by balancing the
one against the other, and by thus combining
their different properties. It is by inattention
to these circumstances that so many persons,
after giving immense prices for animals of particular
stocks, have found themselves foiled
in their attempts at rearing any thing beyond
mediocrity, which animals, under the judicious
management of a Russell, a Coke, or an Ellman,
among cattle, or an Orford, a Meynell,
a Rivers, or a Topham, among dogs, would
have produced unrivalled forms.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Breeding In-and-In.</i>—Among the practical
and systematic breeders of all domestic
animals, and among none more than those
sportsmen who devote themselves to the improvement
of the dog, a great diversity of
opinion has always existed on the subject of
<i>consanguineous breeding</i>, or of that between
near relations, characterised by the term <i>In-and-In</i>.
The conflicting authorities on the
subject are numerous, and the testimonies
contradictory; and it is more than probable
that they will remain so, until a long course
of experiment is undertaken by a body or
society of scientific and observant breeders on
various domestic animals, for the express purpose
of arriving at the truth in this particular.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir John Sebright says, “a breed cannot be
improved, or even continued in the degree of
perfection at which it has already arrived, but
by breeding from individuals, so selected as to
correct each other’s defects, and by a judicious
combination of their different properties (a position
that I believe will not be denied); it follows
that animals must degenerate by being
long bred from the same family, without the
intermixture of any other blood, or from being
what is technically called <i>bred in-and-in</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To Mr. Meynell’s opinion to the contrary,
he replies—“Mr. Meynell’s fox-hounds
are quoted as an instance of the success of this
practice (i. e. <i>the in-and-in</i>); but, on speaking
to that gentleman upon the subject, I
found that he did not attach the meaning that
I do to the term in-and-in. He said, that he
frequently bred from the father and the daughter,
and the mother and the son. This is not
what I consider as breeding in-and-in; for the
daughter is only half of the same blood as the
father, and will probably partake, in a great
degree, of the properties of the mother.” Again:
“I have tried many experiments by breeding
in-and-in upon dogs, fowls, and pigeons; the
dogs became, from strong spaniels, weak and
diminutive lap-dogs; the fowls became long in
the legs, small in the body, and bad breeders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir W. C——n, in his <i>Treatise on Greyhounds</i>,
is unfavourable to breeding a kin.
He says, “If continued for some litters, a
manifest inferiority of size, and a deficiency of
bone, will soon be visible, as well as a want
of courage and bottom; though the beauty of
the form, with the exception of the size, may
not be diminished.”—<i>Blaine.</i>—<i>Sir John
Sebright.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This is of nearly the same shape, but somewhat
less than the Bean Goose, from which it
differs in the colour of its plumage, being mostly
of a uniform brown, the feathers edged with
ash; the upper parts, breast and neck, are
darker than the belly, which is more mixed
and dappled with paler cinereous and gray:
the head and upper half of the neck are
black, excepting a white patch on each side
of the latter, near the throat: the lower part
of the back and rump are also black: the
tail, quills, and legs dusky: the bill is dark,
rather of a narrow shape, and only about an
inch and a half long: the irides are light hazel.
In the female and the younger birds, the
plumage is not so distinctly marked, and the
white spots on the sides of the neck are often
mixed with dusky; but such varyings are
discernible in many other birds, for it seldom
happens that two are found exactly alike.</p>

<p class='c006'>The brent geese, like other species of the
same genus, quit the rigours of the north in
winter, and spread themselves southward in
greater or less numbers, impelled forward,
according to the severity of the season, in
search of milder climates. They are then
met with on the British shores, and spend the
winter months in the rivers, lakes, and
marshes in the interior parts, feeding mostly
upon the roots, and also on the blades of the
long course grasses and plants which grow in
the water; but, indeed, their varied modes of
living, as well as their other habits and propensities,
and their migrations, haltings, breeding-places,
&amp;c., do not differ materially from
those of the other numerous families of the
wild geese. Buffon gives a detail of the devastations
which they made, in the hard
winters of 1740 and 1765, upon the corn-fields
on the coasts of Picardy in France,
where they appeared in such immense swarms,
that the people were literally raised (en masse
we suppose) in order to attempt their extirpation,
which, however, it seems they could
not effect, and a change in the weather only
caused these unwelcome visitants to depart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The brent and the bernacle were formerly,

as merchantmen and cruisers; and
from their sea-worthy qualities and handy

Latterly they have been introduced into the

having built one of the fastest and finest vessels
in the world, has been recently achieved
by the Earl of Belfast.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Water Witch is 331 tons measurement,
and has more than realised all that a
builder could expect. She has, in every trial,
proved her superiority; and in all weathers
maintained a decided advantage over every
antagonist. A letter from the noble owner,
elicited by some trifling misstatement, concerning
her model, &amp;c., appeared in a late number
of the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>, and as it is
briefly descriptive of this beautiful brig, we
have transferred it from the periodical.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her stern is upright, and, consequently,
not so handsome as if it had more over-hung;
but being built for a man-of-war, the intention
(which has completely succeeded) was to
enable her to run two guns out astern without
a platform, which most vessels are obliged to
have, and which is exceedingly inconvenient,
inasmuch as it takes up a considerable portion
of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As regards the quantity of canvas, her sails
are the same size as a ten-gun brig; nor has
she any advantage in being without fittings
below, having all the bulk-heads up (with the
exception of the one that ought to divide the
captain’s cabin from the gun-room), which
was omitted, to make a larger and more airy
cabin for my friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Add to this, that she had her full weight
of stores, &amp;c., on board, as if provisioned for
five months, with eight eighteen-pound carronades,
and two long six-pounders, three
boats, all spare spars, &amp;c., on deck.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have only to add, that to this day she has
beaten everything that has ever attempted to
sail with her, both large and small; and although
His Majesty’s ship Vernon (two thousand
two hundred tons) had the advantage in
light breezes of her one day, by crossing to
windward of her, (after a trial of eight hours)
about a cable’s length, she having started
half a cable’s length to leeward of the Vernon,
I understand she retaliated next day by
beating the Vernon (under double-reefed topsails
and top-gallant sails and considerable
head-sea) two or three miles. I can also
state, she never took advantage of any of her
opponents in starting; and that I should not
have the least objection to change her eighteen-pounders
for four and twenty-pounders, and
sail any square-rigged vessel (now built) in
England for whatever sum they please.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Brood Mares.</span></p>

<p class='c006'>No part of a racing establishment requires
stricter attention than the brood mares. They
should be kept, during the winter, in a paddock
well supplied with water; also with a
roomy hovel, with two wide entrances, to
prevent accidents. There should also be
rollers up each side of the door-way, as foals
are apt to have their hips knocked down in
striking them, or by getting squeezed against
them by the mares in passing in or out. Not
more than two mares should be kept in one
paddock.</p>

<p class='c006'>In winter, brood mares should be fed with
the best hay; and, if in low condition, should
have cold bran mashes twice a day. When
in foal, the greatest care should be taken that
their food be of the sweetest nature; the
olfactory organs of a mare, during the period
of her gestation, being extremely sensitive,
and mouldy hay or straw has frequently
caused premature birth. Indeed, extraordinary
as it may appear, abortion has been
caused by a groom merely striking a mare on
the nose with his hand, which proves that,
during the time they are in foal, they cannot
be kept too quiet, or free from danger or excitement
of any sort. The smell of carrion,
or of animals fresh slaughtered, should be
carefully avoided; for it is very provoking to
lose a fine foal, after the heavy expense incurred,
by these apparently trifling circumstances,
so easily guarded against.</p>

<p class='c006'>Attention should be paid to the state of
the bowels of a newly dropped foal. If a
passage be not observed, the gut should be
carefully emptied by the hand. About a
month previous to foaling, mares should be
fed, at least twice a day, with cold bran
mashes, as also plentifully supplied with any
forward succulent food—such as lucerne, tares,
clover, &amp;c., but the two first are best. It is
desirable to have the mares foal as early as
possible, and when the mare is barren, she
may be covered as early in February as she
will take the horse, and if stinted she will
foal early in January—thereby gaining a considerable
advantage over those foaled later in
the year. For instance, a colt dropped in
January is fifteen months old, when in racing
chronology he only reckons for twelve. It
must, however, be observed, that it is impossible
to have mares to foal every year in the
month of January, unless the mare were to
take the horse every year in February, as her
time of gestation is eleven months and some
days. Consequently, if she were to be covered
in January, she would foal (out of the
year) in December, as was the case with the
December filly.</p>

<p class='c006'>When mares are near their time of foaling,
they should be carefully watched, for
they will always approach water at this time;
and as they generally (though not invariably)
foal standing up, the produce may thus be
lost. Some mares should be watched from
another cause, as they will kill their foals as
soon as they are dropped. When a mare has
foaled, she should have a pail full of warm
gruel, and should live generously until there
is grass for her. The colt should also be fed
with oats (bruised) twice or three times a
day, which it will begin to eat at three days
old.</p>

<p class='c006'>The covering season commences on the first
of February. Mares should be tried by the
teazer every ninth day until the end of the
season, which terminates in July.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those mares which have foaled will be in
season on the third day after; but it is not
advisable to put them to the horse until the
ninth, when they will probably be stinted.
A mare, with a foal at her foot, is quite as
likely to stand to the horse, if not more so,
than one which has never bred, or proved
barren the previous season; as it is called
“missed the horse,” though she might have
bred the year before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various have been the measures resorted to,
to stint mares to the horse, which have proved
barren for several years, or perhaps never bred
at all—such as bleeding, immersing in cold
water, and putting them in motion after the
horse has retired; but no great faith is to be
placed in any of them. It said that opium
has been administered with effect; but in the
cases of Victoria and Echo, every possible
means tried, proved abortive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps it would be better that stallions
which cover at a high price, should only
be suffered to serve a certain number of
mares, as in that case it would not be necessary
to pamper them to that degree generally
practised, to enable them to exceed their
natural powers. I have no hesitation in saying,
that, in the long run, their produce would
be greater, and I reason thus:—A mare which
has missed three or four seasons together, is
put to an ass, and generally stands to him.
Now whatever may be the supposed increased
physical powers of this animal, the effect, in
this instance, is principally to be attributed to
the cool state of his blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is usually the practice to keep stallions
very full of flesh, perpetually crammed with
corn, by which their blood must be in a constant
state of fever, and many of them have
died in consequence of this treatment. Eggs
are also frequently given them in the covering
season. Some years since, a person in
Shropshire, who purchased a horse out of the
north, called “Young Roscius,” at a considerable
price, not taking the precaution of cracking
the egg before he gave it to him, it got
across his gullet and killed him. If, instead
of having recourse to a common farrier, who
attempted to force it down with the butt-end
of a whip, he had sent for a veterinary surgeon,
it might have been dissected out with
the greatest ease and safety, and his horse’s
life preserved. Stallions, at the end of the
season, should be physicked and turned out into
a paddock, with very little corn; but the first
day they are turned out, great precaution is
necessary. They should be walked out on
that day from five o’clock in the morning
until evening; for if turned into the paddock
fresh from their stable, they would gallop
about for hours; and some have been known
to do so until they have dropped down dead.
Early in November, they should be brought
into the stable again, physicked, moderately fed
at first; well cleaned, and exercised every day
for two or three hours; and this plan should
be continued until the commencement of the
next covering season. The air and exercise,
say an hour or two a day, at this time, would
invigorate their bodies, and conduce to their
general health. Grooms may object to this
system; but it has reason on its side, which
they have not always on theirs.—<i>Sporting

may draw two shades of fine bright yellows
from it; you should put the more fur on that
account. Then put down five or six more chips
and boil it on till you bring it to a very deep
orange; lift out your fur, and if you have
half a pound of it you must put down an ounce
of black grain, or half an ounce to a quarter
of a pound; boil it and put in your stuff, and
boil on till you have a blood orange.—Lift
out your stuff, put in three teaspoonfuls of
brasil wood in powder, stir it up and put down
your stuff, boil till it comes to a light fiery
brown. If you see what brasil you have
added does not bring it to that shade, add
more, and when you are near it take out your
stuff, and have prepared in another vessel half
a tablespoonful of archill, by boiling it in
water, put half a noggin of this liquor into
your pot and boil your stuff in it, and then try
your shade, as I think you must be near it.
Put in a little stale urine, and if not dark
enough put in a little salt of tartar, throw in
your stuff and I think you have it. If you want
it darker, repeat the same quantity of salt of
tartar. If you wish you may have two shades
from this very process, or by drawing the fur
may get many fine shades of claret by using
double the quantity of black grain and more
archill. Be nice with the archill, as if you
darken too much with it, you can never discharge
it.</p>

ferocious and unrelenting of the canine tribe,
and may be considered courageous beyond
every other creature in the world, for he will
attack any animal, whatever be his magnitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>The internal changes which determine the
external characters of this dog, consist in a
great development of the frontal sinuses, a
development which elevates the bones of the
forehead above the nose, and draws the cerebral
cavity in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the most important quality, and that,
perhaps, which causes all the others, although
we cannot perceive the connexion, is the diminution
of the brain. The cerebral capacity
of the bull-dog is sensibly smaller than in
any other race; and it is doubtless to the decrease
of the encephalon that we must attribute
its inferiority to all others in every thing
relating to intelligence. The bull-dog is
scarcely capable of any education, and is fitted
for nothing but combat and ferocity.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal takes his name from his having
been employed, in former times, in assaulting
the bull, and he is used for the same purpose
at the present day, in those districts where
this brutal amusement is still practised.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing can exceed the fury with which
the bull-dog falls upon all other animals, and
the invincible obstinacy with which he maintains
his hold. In attacking the bull, he
always assails him in front, and generally
fastens upon his lip, tongue, or eye, where he
holds and hangs on, in spite of the most
desperate efforts of the other to free himself
from his antagonist, which affords ample proof
of the amazing strength and power of this
animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever a bull-dog attacks any of the
extremities of the body, it is invariably considered
a mark of his degeneracy from the
original purity of blood. Puppies will assail
a bull, and thereby give a decided proof of
their breed, when only six months old; and,
if permitted, will rather suffer themselves
to be destroyed than relinquish the contest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although this trial is sometimes made
with the whelps of a particular litter, to demonstrate
the purity of their descent, and
to prove that there has been no improper
cross by which the future fame of their posterity
may be affected, yet they are seldom
entered in a regular ring until from fifteen to
eighteen months old. But their ligaments
cannot be considered as at their full strength
until they are at least two years old. Indeed,
amateurs say, that they are not at their prime
until they have attained four or five years of
age.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bull-dog is admitted by naturalists to
be one of the original and peculiar races of
Britain, and may be ranked, in point of originality,
with the shepherd’s dog and Irish greyhound.
In various districts of England this
breed is still preserved in its native purity,
by that class of people who delight in bullbaiting
and fighting of dogs; both of which
amusements, alike inhuman, are now happily
on the decline.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bull-head</span>, <i>s.</i> The name of a fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bull-head seldom exceeds the length
of three inches and a half; the head is large,
broad, flat, and thin at its circumference,
being well adapted for insinuating itself under
stones; on the middle part of the covers of
the gills is a small crooked spine turning inwards;
the eyes are very small, the irides
yellow; the body grows slender towards the
tail, and is very smooth; the colour is as disagreeable
as its form, being dusky, mixed
with a dirty yellow; the belly whitish. They
are found all the summer in holes, among
mud and gravel, and among weeds and flat
stones in clear water, where they may be seen
sunning themselves in a hot day; put the
hook, with a small red worm, before them,
and they will instantly take it. Notwithstanding
the disgust which the form of the
bull-head creates, the largest, when the heads
are cut off, are very delicious eating; they are
also good baits for other fish. Some anglers
think them, when their gill-fins are cut away,
preferable to the minnow.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Bull Terrier</span> (<i>Canis Pugilis</i>), <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This variety, which has now assumed a fixed
character, as its name implies, was produced
by a cross between the bull-dog and terrier,
and this variety proves to be a handsomer dog
than either of its progenitors. It is a sprightly
and showy animal, and even better adapted
for mischievous sport than either of the above
dogs. He is airy and pleasant tempered, but
possesses great fierceness when his energies
are called into action.</p>

<p class='c006'>The full-sized bull terrier is larger than
either of his original parents, from which we
are inclined to think he has a dash of the
mastiff in him. He has rather a large square
head, short neck, deep chest, and very strong
legs. He possesses great strength of jaw, and
draws a badger with much ease. He is all
colours, and often white, with large black or
brown patches on different parts of his body.
His hair is short and stiff.</p>

<p class='c006'>This variety has risen into great reputation
with gentlemen of the fancy, and consequently
good ones sell for a high price. Bull terriers
are to be had of every colour in the metropolis—and
of late years, dealing in these and
other dogs has become a regular trade.—<i>Brown,

<p class='c006'>This species migrates, like the salmon, into
several of our rivers; they begin to run up
the rivers in May, and are most plentiful in
September and October, although the flesh is
not then so good (on account of their spawning)
as in July and August; when boiled, it
is of a pale red, and well flavoured, but drier
than that of the salmon. Mr. Pennant has
described one taken in June, 1769, in the
Tweed below Berwick.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shape was thicker than the common
trout; the irides silver, and the head thick,
smooth, and dusky, with a gloss of blue and
green; the back of the same colour, growing
fainter towards the lateral line, which is
straight; and the sides, as far as this line, are
marked with large irregular-shaped spots of
black; the sides beneath the line and the
belly are white; the tail is broad and even at
the end; the weight was three pounds two
ounces.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bull have the same haunts as the salmon
trout, and are sometimes met with in
gentle shallow streams, running between and
over rocks and stones, and are also found
about weirs, made across rivers. The baits
and tackle should be the same as for the salmon
trout.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The principal difference between this kind
and that of the passerine order, consists in the
formation of the bill, which in the bunting is

<p class='c006'>The two mandibles are movable, and the
edges of each bend inwards; the opening of
the mouth is not in a straight line as in other
birds, but at the base, the junction is formed
by an obtuse angle in the lower mandible,
nearly one-third of its length, which is received
by a corresponding angle in the upper
one; in the latter there is a strong knob, of
great use in breaking the harder kinds of
seeds and kernels, on which it feeds. The
tongue is narrow, and tapers to a point like a

<p class='c006'><i>Great Bustard.</i>—This very singular bird,
which is the largest of our land birds, is about
four feet long, and weighs from twenty-five to
thirty pounds; its characters are peculiar, and
with such as connect it with birds of the gallinaceous
kind, it has others which seem to
belong to the ostrich and the cassowary. Its
bill is strong, and rather convex: its eyes red;
on each side of the lower bill there is a tuft
of feathers about nine inches long; its head
and neck are ash-coloured. In the one described
by Edwards there are on each side of
the neck two naked spots, of a violet colour,
but which appeared to be covered with feathers
when the neck was much extended.
The back is barred transversely with black
and bright rust-colour on a pale reddish
ground; the quills are black, the belly white;
the tail consists of twenty feathers; the
middle ones are rust-colour, barred with
black; those on each side are white, with a
bar or two of black near the ends; the legs
are long, naked above the knees, and dusky;
it has no hind toe, its nails are short, strong,
and convex both above and below; the bottom
of the foot is furnished with a callous prominence,
which serves instead a heel. The
female is not much more than half the size of
the male: the top of her head is of a deep
orange, the rest of the head brown; her
colours are not so bright as those of the male,
and she has no tuft on each side of the head.
There is likewise another very essential difference
between the male and the female:
the former is furnished with a sack or pouch,
situated in the forepart of the neck, and
capable of containing about two quarts; the
entrance to it is immediately under the
tongue. This singular reservoir was first
discovered by Dr. Douglas, who supposes
that the bird fills it with water as a supply in
the midst of those dreary plains where it is
accustomed to wander. It likewise makes a
farther use of it in defending itself against the
attacks of birds of prey. On such occasions,
it throws out the water with such violence,
as not unfrequently to baffle the pursuit of
its enemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bustards were formerly more common in
this island than at present; they are now
found only in the open counties of the south
and east, in the plains of Wiltshire, Dorsetshire,
and in some parts of Yorkshire; they
were formerly met with in Scotland, but are
now supposed to be extinct there. They are
slow in taking wing, but run with great rapidity,
and when young are sometimes taken
with grey-hounds, which pursue them with
great avidity: their chase is said to afford excellent
diversion. The great bustard is granivorous,
but feeds chiefly on herbs of various
kinds, it is also fond of those worms which
are seen to come out of the ground in great
numbers before sun-rise in the summer; in
winter, it frequently feeds on the bark of
trees; like the ostrich, it swallows small
stones, bits of metal, and the like. The
female builds no nest, but making a hole in
the ground drops two eggs, about the size of
those of a goose, of a pale olive brown, with
dark spots. She sometimes leaves her eggs
in quest of food; and if during her absence,
any one should handle, or even breathe upon
them, she immediately abandons them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bustards are found in various parts of
Europe, Asia, and Africa; but have not
hitherto been discovered on the new continent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Little Bustard, (<i>Otis Tetrax</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>La Petite Outarde</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) is in length only
seventeen inches. The bill is pale brown;
irides red; the top of the head is black, spotted
with pale rust colour; the sides of the head,
the chin, and throat, are of a reddish white,
marked with a few dark spots; the whole neck
is black, encircled with an irregular band of
white near the top and bottom; the back and
wings are rust colour, mottled with brown,
and crossed with fine irregular black lines, the
under parts of the body, and outer edges of the
wings, are white: the tail consists of eighteen
feathers; the middle ones are tawny, barred
with black, the others are white marked with
a few irregular bands of black, the legs are
grey. The female is smaller, and has not the
black collar on the neck; in other respects she
nearly resembles the male.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is very uncommon in this country:
and we have seen only two of them, both
females. The figure was drawn from one sent
by W. Trevelyan, Esq. which was taken on
the edge of Newmarket heath, and kept alive
about three weeks in a kitchen, where it was
fed with bread and other things, such as poultry
eat. It is very common in France, where
it is also a very shy and cunning bird; if disturbed
it flies two or three hundred paces, not
far from the ground, and then runs away much
faster than any one can follow on foot. The
female lays her eggs in June, to the number
of three or four, of a glossy green colour: as
soon as the young are hatched, she leads them
about as the hen does her chickens: they begin
to fly about the middle of August.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both this and the great bustard are excellent
eating, and, we should imagine, would
well repay the trouble of domestication: indeed,
it seems surprising that we should suffer
these fine birds to run wild, and be in danger
of total extinction, which, if properly cultivated,
might afford as excellent a repast as our
own domestic poultry, or even as the turkey,
(<i>vide</i> <span class='sc'>Turkey</span>) for which we are indebted to
distant countries.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Butt</span>, <i>s.</i> The place on which the mark to be shot at is placed; a vessel;

<p class='c006'>The marks usually shot at by archers, for
pastime, were “butts, prickes, and roavers.”
The butt, we are told, was a level mark, and
required a strong arrow, with a very broad
feather; the pricke was a “mark of compass,”
but certain in its distance; and to this mark
strong swift arrows, of one flight, with a middling
sized feather, were best suited; the
roaver was a mark of uncertain lengths. It
was, therefore, proper for the archer to have
various kinds of arrows, of different weights,
to be used according to the different changements
made in the distance of the ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Cornish men are spoken of as good
archers, who shoot their arrows to a great
length; they are also, says Carew, “well
skilled in near shooting, and in well aimed
shooting: the butts made them perfect in
the one, and the roaving in the other, for the
prickes, the first corrupters of archery, through
too much preciseness, were formerly scarcely
known, and little practised.” Other marks
are occasionally mentioned; as the standard,
the target, hazel wands, rose garlands, and the
popinjay, which, we are told, was an artificial
parrot.—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The Common Buzzard, or Puttock.—(<i>Falco
Buteo</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Buse</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)
M. Buffon distinguishes the kites and the buzzards
from the eagles and hawks, by their habits
and dispositions, which he compares to
those of the vultures, and places them after
those birds. Though possessed of strength,
agility, and weapons to defend themselves,
they are cowardly, inactive, and slothful, they
will fly before a sparrow-hawk, and when overtaken,
will suffer themselves to be beaten, and
even brought to the ground, without resistance.
The buzzard is about twenty inches in length,
and in breadth four feet and a half. Its bill
is of a lead colour, eyes pale yellow: the upper
parts of the body are of a dusky brown
colour; the wings and tail are marked with
bars of a darker hue; the under parts pale,
variegated with a light reddish brown; the legs
are yellow; claws black. But birds of this
species are subject to greater variations than
most other birds, as scarcely two are alike:
some are entirely white, of others the head
only is white, and others again are mottled
with brown and white.</p>

<p class='c006'>This well-known bird is of a sedentary and
indolent disposition; it continues for many
hours perched upon a tree or eminence, whence
it darts upon the game that comes within its
reach: it feeds on birds, small quadrupeds,
reptiles and insects. Its nest is constructed
with small branches, lined in the inside with
wool and other soft materials; it lays two or
three eggs, of a whitish colour, spotted with
yellow. It feeds and tends its young with
great assiduity. Ray affirms, that if the female
be killed during the time of incubation,
the male buzzard takes charge of them, and
patiently rears the young till they are able
to provide for themselves.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The Honey Buzzard (<i>Falco Apivorus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Bondrée</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>), is as large as
the buzzard, measuring twenty-two inches in
length; the wings extend above four feet.
Its bill is black, and rather longer than that
of the buzzard; the eyes are yellow; the
head large and flat, and of an ash-colour; the
upper parts of the body dark brown; the
under parts white, spotted or barred with rusty
brown on the breast and belly; tail brown,
marked with three broad dusky bars, between
each of which are two or three of the same
colour, but narrower; the legs are stout and
short, of a dull yellow colour; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird builds a nest similar to that of
the buzzard, and of the same kind of materials:
its eggs are of an ash-colour, with
small brown spots. It sometimes takes possession
of the nests of other birds, and feeds
its young with wasps and other insects. It is
fond of field-mice, frogs, lizards and insects.
It does not soar like the kite, but flies low,
from tree to tree, or from bush to bush. It
is found in all the northern parts of Europe,
and in the open parts of Russia and Siberia,
but is not so common in England as the
buzzard.</p>

<p class='c006'>Buffon observes that it is frequently caught
in the winter, when it is fat and delicious
eating.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The Moor Buzzard, Duck Hawk or White-headed
Harpy (<i>Falco Æruginosus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Busard</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) is in length above twenty-one
inches. The bill is black; cere and eyes
yellow; the whole crown of the head is of a
yellowish white, lightly tinged with brown;
the throat is of a light rust colour: the rest
of the plumage is of a reddish brown, with
pale edges; the greater wing coverts tipped
with white. The legs are yellow; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birds of this kind vary much; in some,
the crown and back part of the head are yellow;
and in one described by Mr. Latham,
the whole bird was uniformly of a chocolate
brown, with a tinge of rust colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moor buzzard preys on rabbits, young
wild ducks, and other water-fowl; and likewise
feeds on fish, frogs, reptiles, and even
insects. Its haunts are in hedges and bushes
near pools, marshes, and rivers that abound
with fish. It builds its nest a little above the
surface of the ground, or in hillocks covered
with thick herbage: the female lays three
or four eggs of a whitish colour, irregularly
sprinkled with dusky spots. Though smaller,
it is more active and bolder than the common
buzzard, and, when pursued, it faces its antagonist,
and makes a vigorous defence.—<i>Bewick.</i>—<i>Latham.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The several kinds of cadews in their nympha,
or maggot state, thus house themselves;
one sort in straw, called from thence straw-worms;
others in two or more parallel sticks,
creeping at the bottom of brooks; a third, in
a small bundle of pieces of rushes, duckweed,
&amp;c. glued together, therewith they float on the
surface, and can row themselves about the water
with the help of their feet; both these are
called cad-bait. It is a curious faculty that
these creatures possess, of gathering such bodies
as are fittest for their purpose, and then
so gluing them together, some to be heavier
than water, that the animal may remain at
bottom where its food is, and others to be so
buoyant as to float, and there collect its sustenance;
these houses are coarse, and show no
outward art, but are within well tunnelled and
have a tough hard paste, into which the hinder
part of the maggot is so fixed, that its cell can
be drawn after it without danger of leaving it
behind, and it can also thrust out its body to
reach the needful supplies, or withdraw into
its covering for protection and safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>These insects inhabit pits, ponds, low running
rivers, or ditches, in cases of different
forms, and composed of various materials;
some of them inclosed in a very rough shell,
found among weeds in standing waters, are
generally tinged green; others are bigger than
a gentle, and of a yellowish hue, with a black
head; they are an excellent bait, and are found
in most plenty in gravelly and stony rivulets,
and by the sides of streams, in large rivers
among stones.</p>

<p class='c006'>To collect them, turn up the stones, and the
best will adhere to them; when the quantity
wanted is obtained, put them into a linen bag for
five or six days, dip them, together with the bag,
into water once a day, and hang them up; they
will then turn yellow, become tough, and fitter
for angling than when first got from the brook.
If meant to be kept long, they must be put into a
thick woollen bag, with some of the moist gravel
or sand from the same rivulet whence they
are taken; they must be wetted twice a day,
but oftener in very hot weather; when you
carry them abroad, fill the bag with water and
holding the mouth of it close, let the water
run from them; thus they have been kept
three weeks. Another way of preserving them
is, by placing them in an earthen pot full of
river water, with some of the gravel they were
bred in at the bottom; but the preceding method
is preferable: some use bait pans of different
sizes for insects, the tops punched full
of holes, not so large as to admit of their escaping
when placed in the river, which not
only keeps them cool, but supplies them with
aliment in the fresh water; some keep them
in moss in a woollen bag on a damp floor, taking
care that the bag retains a proper moisture.
Another mode of preserving caddis, and also
grasshoppers, caterpillars, oak-worms, or natural
flies, is to take the green withy bark from
a bough six or seven inches round, and about
a foot in length, turn both ends into the form
of a hoop, and fasten them with a large needle
and thread; stop up the bottom with cork,
and bore the bark full of holes with a red hot
wire, tie over it a colewort leaf, and lay it in
the grass every night: in this manner caddis
may be preserved until they turn to flies.
When grasshoppers are to be preserved in the
case, some grass must be put into it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In angling with caddis, the line, when all
out, should be as long as the rod, for three
lengths next the hook, of single hairs, with
the smallest float, and the least weight of lead,
that the swiftness of the stream will allow to
sink, and that may be aided by avoiding the
violence of the current, and angling in the returns
of a stream, or in the eddies betwixt two;
which are also the most likely places wherein
to kill fish, either at the top or bottom. The
caddis may be at times, with very good effect,
joined to a worm, and sometimes to an artificial
fly, to cover the point of the hook, and
also two or three together may be put upon the
hook; but it is always to be angled with at the
bottom, especially when by itself, with the
finest tackle, and at all seasons is a most holding
bait for trout and grayling.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Calomel</span>, <i>s.</i> Mercury six times sublimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Calomel, or <i>submuriate of mercury</i>, is
the most useful of the mercurial preparations,
and composed of oxide of quicksilver and
muriatic acid. When prepared it is a fine
white powder, rather inclining to yellow, and
very ponderous. It is the most efficacious
<i>anthelminthic</i> we are acquainted with (see
<span class='sc'>Anthelminthic</span>), and an excellent <i>alterative</i>.
When a brisk purgative is wanted, calomel
may be added to the common physic, which
is composed chiefly of aloes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though calomel possesses these useful
qualities, it must be given with caution, and
its effects carefully watched; as it sometimes
acts very violently and unexpectedly on the
stomach and bowels, and induces a dangerous
degree of weakness. Salivation is sometimes
the effect of calomel, when given daily as an
alterative, or as a remedy for farcy or mange;
the mouth becoming so sore, and the tongue
so swollen, as to prevent the horse’s feeding.
When these accidents occur, the medicine
should be discontinued a short time, and the
horse allowed to drink plentifully of water-gruel,
linseed infusion, or any other mucilaginous
drink. When the bowels are affected
by it, opium is the best remedy, should
arrow-root gruel or wheat-flour gruel prove
ineffectual. In some cases, where it has produced
great irritation about the anus or bladder,
opium should be given in the form of
<i>clyster</i>. (See <span class='sc'>Clysters</span>.) If the mouth becomes
very sore, let it be washed with a
solution of alum, by means of a syringe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever calomel is given, the horse must
be kept warm, drink warm water, and have
regular exercise. When calomel is given as
an anthelminthic, or as a purgative, the dose is
from one to two drachms; as an alterative,
from fifteen grains to half a drachm. Calomel
generally acts upon the kidneys, increasing
the discharge of urine. (See <span class='sc'>Alteratives</span> and

bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>In length this beautiful species is about
five inches and a half; the bill pale flesh-colour,
passing into reddish white; eyes chestnut
brown; the whole plumage of a rich, deep
primrose colour, inclining to yellow; edge of
the quills sometimes yellowish white; legs
and feet the same colour as the bill. The
female is distinguished from the male by the
plumage being of a paler colour; the yellow
round the bill, eye, and on the breast and
edge of the wing, being also of a paler yellow;
she is likewise rather larger and less slender
in form towards the tail.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are said to be upwards of thirty varieties
of the breeds of canaries, which can be
easily distinguished; and the number is increasing
every year. In London, we have
societies for promoting the breeds, and a premium
is awarded to the competitor who comes
nearest to the model of perfection given out
by the society the season prior to the competition.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two distinct species of canaries,
the plain and the variegated, or, as they are
technically called, the gay spangles, or mealy;
and jonks, or jonquils. These two varieties
are more esteemed by amateurs than any of
the numerous varieties which have sprung
from them; and although birds of different
feathers have their admirers, some preferring
beauty of plumage, others excellence of song,
certainly that bird is most desirable where
both are combined. The first property of
these birds consists in the cap, which ought
to be of fine orange colour, pervading every
part of the body except the tail and wings,
and possessing the utmost regularity without
any black feathers, as, by the smallest speck,
it loses the property of a show-bird, and is
considered a broken-capped bird. The second
property consists in the feathers of the wing
and tail being of a deep black up to the quill,
as a single white feather in the wing or tail
causes it to be termed a foul bird; the requisite
number of these feathers in each wing is
eighteen, and in the tail twelve. It is,
however, frequently observed that the best
coloured birds are foul in one or two feathers,
which reduces their value, although they may
still be matched to breed with.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A small breeding cage is all that is required
for rearing these birds; but where a room can
be allotted to the purpose, it ought to have
shrubs for them to roost and build, with
plenty of water to drink and bathe in, that
being indispensable for all birds. The light
should be admitted into the room from the
east, for the benefit of the morning sun, and
the windows should have wire cloth, that
they may enjoy the fresh air. The floor of
the apartment ought to be strewed with sand
or white gravel, and on that should be thrown
groundsel, chickweed, or scalded rapeseed; but
when breeding, they should have nothing except
hard chopped eggs, dry bread, cake without
salt, and, once in two or three days, a
few poppy-seeds. Some bird-fanciers give
their breeding-birds plantains and lettuce-seeds;
but this should be done sparingly, and
only for two days, lest it should weaken them.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the 15th of April they ought to be
furnished with flax, soft hay, wool, hair, moss,
and other dry materials, for building the nest,
which usually occupies about three days: the
time of incubation is thirteen days; but when
the hen has sat eight or nine days, it is
necessary to examine the eggs, holding them
carefully by the ends, against the sun or a
lighted candle, and to throw away the clear
ones. Some bird-fanciers substitute an ivory
egg until the last is laid, when the real ones
are replaced, that they may be hatched at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the young are to be reared by the
stick, they must be taken from the mother
on the eighth day, taking nest and all. Prior
to this, the food should consist of a paste
composed of boiled rapeseed, the yolk of an
egg, and crumbs of cake unsalted, mixed
with a little water; this must be given every
two hours. This paste ought not to be too
wet, and must be renewed daily, until the
nestlings can feed themselves. The hen has
generally three broods in the year, but will
hatch five times in the season, each time
laying six eggs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process of moulting, which takes place
five or six weeks after they are hatched, is
frequently fatal to them. The best remedy yet
known is to put a small piece of iron into the
water they drink, keeping them warm during
the six weeks or two months which generally
elapse before they regain their strength. This
malady, to which they are all subject, is often
fatal to the hen after the sixth or seventh
year; and even the cock, though from superior
strength he may recover, and continue occasionally
to sing, and survive his mate four or
five years, appears dull and melancholy from
this period, till he gradually droops, and falls
a victim to this evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it is proposed to rear gay birds, the cock
and hen should be of the same deep colour;
if mottled birds are required, both parents
should be mottled. When a gay bird and a
fancy bird are matched, they are termed mule-birds,
because they are irregularly mottled in
their plumage, and therefore of no value,
although they be equally good singers. The
spangled or French canary cock, with a mealy
hen, often produces beautiful varieties.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The most common cause of disease in birds
proceeds from a superabundance of food,
which brings on repletion. In this case the
intestines descend to the extremities of the
body, and appear through the skin, while the
feathers on the part affected fall off, and the
poor bird, after a few days, pines and dies.
If the disease is not too far gone, putting
them in separate cages, and confining them to
the cooling diet of water and lettuce-seed,
may save the lives of many: they are also
subject to epilepsy, asthma, ulcers in the
throat, and to extinction of the voice. The
cure for the first is doubtful; it is said that if
a drop of blood fall from the bill, the bird
will recover life and sense; but if touched
prior to falling of itself, it will occasion death.
If they recover from the first attack, they frequently
live for many years without any
alteration in their note. Another cure is to
inflict a slight wound in the foot. Asthma is
cured by plantain, and hard biscuit soaked in
white wine; while ulcers, like repletion, must
be cured by cooling food. For extinction of
voice, the cure ought to be hard yolk of eggs,
chopped up with crumbs of bread, and for
drink a little liquorice-root, or a blade of saffron
in water. In addition to these evils, the
canary is infested by a small insect, if they
are kept dirty. To avoid this, they should
have plenty of water to bathe in, in a new
cage, covered with new cloth, and their seeds
well sifted and washed. These attentions, if
troublesome, are nevertheless necessary to
possess a thriving bird. When wild, it has
already been remarked, that all birds require
water, and to a canary this is so necessary,
that if a saucer or cup of snow be put into the
cage they will flutter against it with the utmost
delight, even during the most severe
winters. They are bred in immense numbers,
both for amusement and commerce, in
France, Tyrol, Germany, and in this country:
those from Germany are in the least esteem,
from their living only one or two years in this
country, although the cock of this variety is
an approved songster.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cancer</span>, <i>s.</i> A crabfish; a virulent swelling; a sore.</p>

<p class='c006'>The virulent, dreadful ulcer, that is so fatal
in the human subject, and is called cancer, is
unknown in dogs; yet there is very commonly
a large scirrhous swelling of the teats
in bitches, and of the testicles (though less
frequent) in dogs, that as it sometimes becomes
ulcerated, so it may be characterised
by this name. In the early state of this
disease, discutients prove useful; as vinegar
with salt, and camphor and Spanish flies with
mercurial ointment, have sometimes succeeded,
taking care to avoid irritating the part
so much as to cause blister. But when the
swelling is detached from the belly, and hangs
pendulous in the skin, it had better be removed;
and, as a future preventative, suffer
the bitch to breed. Scirrhous testicles are
likewise sometimes met with; for these no
treatment yet discovered succeeds, but the
removal of the part, and that before the spermatic
chord becomes much affected, or it will
be useless.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Canker in the ear.</i>—A common and troublesome
disease, to which dogs are liable. To
cure it, boil two ounces of best shag tobacco
in a quart of water, until one pint is consumed;
dip the dog’s ears, as it is boiling hot, into the
tobacco water, until two inches above the cankered
part; repeat it three successive days.
To bring the hair again, burn some old shoe,
and mix with a quarter of a pound of hog’s-lard,
and frequently anoint the ears; but the
readiest and best way to rid dogs of cankers,
is to apply the rounding-iron.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In the early stages, a wash composed of
half a drachm of superacetate (sugar) of lead,
dissolved in four ounces of rose or rain water,
is often all that is necessary. A small teaspoonful
may be introduced (previously warmed
to a blood heat, to prevent surprise) night
and morning, rubbing the root of the ear at the
same time, to promote the entrance of the
wash into the cavities. In more obstinate
cases, it is prudent to add fifteen or twenty
grains of vitriolated zinc (white vitriol) to the
wash; and if, instead of water, a decoction of
oak bark is made use of to form the wash, it
will greatly promote the end desired. In
some cases, acetate of copper (verdigris),
mixed with oil, has proved beneficial when
introduced in the same manner. In others,
submuriate of quicksilver (calomel) and oil
have produced amendment in the same way.
A <i>very</i> weak injection of the oxymuriate of
quicksilver (corrosive sublimate) has succeeded
when every other application has
failed. A very mild injection of nitrate of
silver, as one grain to two ounces of water,
has done much good also.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Canker on the outside of the ear consists
of an ill-disposed ulcer, which is usually
situated on the lower edge of the flap or pendulous
part of one or both ears, dividing it
into a kind of slit. It seems to itch intolerably,
and is therefore kept in a continual
state of aggravation by the shaking of the
dog’s head. An unguent, made with equal
parts of ointment of nitrated quicksilver and
calamine cerate, may be applied once a day,
carefully securing the ear from the injury
occasioned by the shaking of the head, by a
sort of head dress, during its use. Or the
following may be tried:—</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases, the oxymuriate of silver has
become more efficacious in a wash, six grains
being dissolved in four ounces of water.
Strong astringent lotions are sometimes useful;
as alum dissolved in a decoction of oak
bark. When the disease proves very obstinate,
excision must be resorted to, taking
care that the whole, not only of the immediate
cracked part, but also of its tumefied
edges, are included in the operation.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In tumefied flap of the ear, the tumour
ought either to be opened its full length, and
a pledget of lint introduced, to prevent too
hasty a union of the outer edges of the sac;
or a seton should be introduced, embracing
the whole of the tumour, which should be
suffered to remain for a week or ten days.
By this means, instead of a discharge of
serum, healthy matter will form in a little
time; the sides will granulate and unite, and
on the removal of the seton, the external
lips of the wound will close firmly and
healthily.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Canoa</span>, or <span class='sc'>Canoe</span>, <i>s.</i> A boat made by cutting the trunk of a tree into a
hollow vessel; a very light boat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Poole canoe is built sharp at both
ends, on the plan of the Greenland whale-boat,
except being so flat at the bottom as to
draw only two or three inches of water, and
so light as to weigh only from sixty to two
hundred pounds. In making all canoes for gunning,
the builder should be careful to have the
bottoms of them a little rounded (say about
half an inch of convex “a-midships,” for a bottom
three feet broad); and, what is of still more
consequence, a little “kammelled,” or sprung;
that is, gradually rising “fore and aft,” in
order to “give them life.” They will, otherwise,
row miserably heavy, and, when they
get aground, suck the mud or sand so much,
that, in order to get them off again, you might
be forced to stand up, and this would frighten
away the fowl. If, however, the bottom of a
canoe is too much kammelled, she will never
keep steady in going to birds. Some people,
for this reason, leave hollow grooves between
the bottom planks. I should say, that to every
five feet of plank I would give about one
inch of “kammel;” so that the bottom of
the canoe being ten feet, would, by holding
a string along the centre of the bottom,
outside, prove convex about two inches. If
a little more, she would be none the worse;
perhaps the better, provided that she drew
water enough to give a bearing to every part;
otherwise the ends that were sprung, would,
by being out of the water, “cluck” so much
as to make birds swim away in the night. In
short, let your draught of water be the chief
guide to regulate the kammelling, or springing,
of your punts and canoes. If not required
for rough work, or a fixed swivel-gun, I should
recommend all the planks to be not more than
three quarters of the thickness specified in the
plate; as nothing, provided it be perfectly
safe, can be too light for getting to wild birds.
It is the large size of a boat, not the substance
of the wood, that makes her safe in a
sea. If the builder puts some oakum and tar
round the heads of the principal nails, before
he drives them in, so much the better.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Canter</span>, <i>s.</i> A short gallop.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief paces for a hack to carry a gentleman
are the walk and the canter. A very
quick trot is a most ungentlemanlike pace,
and only fit for a butcher; besides which, it
wears out a horse much sooner than a canter,
from the weight being all thrown upon one
fore leg at the same time; whereas, in the
canter, it is equally divided between both.
Added to this a canter is much more easy, as
well as safer to the rider, the horse having
his haunches more under him than when he
trots, thereby more likely to recover himself
in case of making a mistake, which the best
is sometimes subject to. Fast trotting also
distresses a horse more than cantering, because
in the one he is going up to the top of
his speed, and in the other much below it.—<i>Nimrod.</i></p>

they inflame and excoriate the skin; and hence
raise a more perfect blister than any other
substance: this property renders them extremely
useful in veterinary practice, in which
a good <i>blister</i> is the most important of all
external remedies. Cantharides should be
finely powdered; but previously to this operation
they should be sifted, that they may be
free from a great deal of dust and useless matter,
which we generally observe with them.
When powdered, they may be either formed
into an ointment, a liniment, or a spirituous
tincture; but the former is the best form, and
most commonly used. (See <span class='sc'>Blisters</span>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Cantharides are imported from Sicily and
Astracan, in sacks and small chests. The best
are of a lively fresh colour, a small size, and not
mouldy, nor mixed with the <i>Melolontha vitis</i>;
an insect resembling them in some degree, but
possessing no vesicating property. It may be
distinguished by its form, which is more square
than that of the Spanish fly, and by its black
feet. If Spanish flies have been properly dried
and kept in a well-stopped glass bottle, they
retain their acrimony, and remain unchanged
a great length of time; but sometimes they
are attacked by a small worm, which, however,
feeds on the inactive part only of the fly,
reducing it to a powder that still possesses the
active quality of the entire insect. They soon
putrify when kept in a damp place, and therefore
should be occasionally spread out to the
air.—<i>Thomson’s London Dispensatory.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The male of this species is polygamous,
and lives separate from the females, except
in the breeding season. Their manner and
habits are very like those of the black grous,
except that this seems to be confined wholly
to forests of pine, on the tender shoots of
which it feeds. It was formerly to be met
with in Scotland and Ireland, but is now
extinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is said to lay from eight to sixteen
eggs, of a white colour, spotted with yellow,
larger than those of our domestic fowl.
Dr. Latham says, he is well informed the nest
of one found in Scotland was placed on a Scotch
pine; if so, it differs from all the genus, who
are known to lay their eggs on the bare ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not uncommon in the pine forests of
Norway, whence we have received it. It is
also found plentiful in Russia and Siberia,
in Italy, and several parts of the Alps. It
formerly frequented the fir woods of Ireland
and Scotland, and was last seen in 1760, in
the woods of Strathglass. It continued in
Strathspey till 1745. Recent attempts have
been made to re-introduce the species from
Norway without success.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinese are said to be particularly skilful
in this operation, the outline of which, according
to their mode, I give as a matter of
curiosity. The wings of the fowl are folded
back till they meet, and the left foot of the
operator is placed upon them, the great toe of
his right foot pressing upon the legs to keep
them fast. After pulling the feathers, an incision
is made, one inch long, and one inch
from the spine, obliquely downward and forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the operation, instead of being melancholy,
abashed, and humiliated, the capon assumes
a bold, lofty, and triumphant air; and
such is the influence of audacity over all animals,
that his borrowed courage completely
imposes on the cocks and hens, and prevents
them from disturbing him in the fulfilment of
his charge. At first, he is a little awkward in
the exercise of his office. His ambition, in imitating
in his gait, the majesty and dignity of the
cocks, makes him carry his head too stiff, and
prevents him from seeing the chickens, which
he sometimes thus inadvertently tramples under
foot. But experience soon teaches him to
avoid such mishaps, and accidents of the same
kind do not occur again.—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The seeds are cordial and carminative, and
from them an <i>essential oil</i> is obtained for
veterinary purposes. The dose is from half a
drachm to a drachm, and may be mixed either
with ale, milk, or water, into a drench; or
formed into a ball with powdered liquorice,
powdered ginger, and honey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Caraway is a useful cordial and carminative.
The dose of <i>the seed</i> is about an
ounce; to which may be added a drachm or
two of powdered ginger.</p>

<p class='c006'>From twenty to thirty drops of oil of caraway
are a useful addition to aloes, making a
purgative ball; or, as it is commonly termed,
a dose of physic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though the essential oil is the most convenient
form for giving caraways, it is not
perhaps so grateful to the stomach, or likely
to produce so gradual or durable a stimulus as
the recently powdered seeds. Caraways lose
their power by long keeping, especially in
damp places. When the essential oil is employed,
the best manner of mixing it is to rub
it in a mortar with sugar and treacle, and to
add the ale or water gradually. Or it may
be mixed in the proportion of one part of the
oil to two of spirit of wine, and kept as an
essence of caraway: this, when mixed with
ale or water, will be more uniformly diffused
through the liquor than the oil alone, which
will immediately float on the surface.—<i>White.</i></p>

are easily freed. These are preferred in medical
practice, probably on account of their more
grateful smell and taste, but the larger sort,

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cards</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The general opinion respecting the origin
of playing-cards is, that they were first made
for the amusement of Charles VI. of France,
at the time he was afflicted with a mental
derangement, which commenced in 1392,
and continued for several years. In proof of
this supposition, an article in the treasury
registers belonging to that monarch is quoted,
which states that a payment of fifty-six sols
was made to Jacquemin Gringonneur, painter,
for three packs of cards gilded and painted
with divers colours and different devices, to
be carried to the king for his diversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Spain, as early as A.D. 1387, John I.,
king of Castile, in an edict, forbade playing of
cards and dice in his dominions. The provost
of Paris, January 22, A.D. 1397, published
an ordinance, prohibiting the manufacturing
part of the people from playing at tennis,
dice, cards, &amp;c. which has inclined several
modern writers upon this subject to refer the
invention of cards from France to Spain; and
the names of some of the cards, as well as of
many of the most ancient games, being evidently
derived from the Spanish language, are
justly considered as strong corroborating arguments
in favour of such an opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very intelligent writer upon the origin
of engraving, Baron Heineken, asserts, that
playing-cards were invented in Germany,
where they were used towards the latter end
of the fourteenth century; but his reasons
are by no means conclusive. He says they
were known there as early as the year 1376.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time that cards were first introduced,
they were drawn and painted by the hand
without the assistance of a stamp or plate;
it follows of course that much time was
required to complete a set or pack of cards;
and the price they bore, no doubt, was adequate
to the labour bestowed upon them,
which necessarily must have enhanced their
value beyond the purchase of the under classes
of the people. For this reason it is, I presume,
that card-playing, though it might have
been known in England, was not much practised
until such time as inferior sets of cards,
proportionably cheap, were produced for the
use of the commonalty, which seems to have
been the case when Edward IV. ascended the
throne, for in 1463, early in his reign, an act
was established, on a petition from the card-makers
of the city of London, prohibiting the
importation of playing-cards; and soon after
that period card-playing became a very general
pastime.</p>

<p class='c006'>The increasing demand for these objects of
amusement, it is said, suggested the idea of
cutting the outlines appropriated to the different
suits upon separate blocks of wood, and
stamping them upon the cards; the intermediate
spaces between the outlines were filled
up with various colours laid on by the hand.
This expeditious method of producing cards
reduced the price of them, so that they might
readily be purchased by almost every class of
persons. The common usage of cards was soon
productive of serious evils, which all the exertions
of the legislative power have not been
able to eradicate.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The carp is the queen of rivers; a stately,
a good and a very subtle fish; that was not at
first bred, nor hath been long in England, but
is now naturalised. It is said, they were
brought hither by one Mr. Mascal, a gentleman
that then lived at Plumsted in Sussex,
a county that abounds more with fish than
any in this nation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Carps and loaches are observed to breed several
months in one year, which pikes and most
other fish do not. And this is partly proved
by tame and wild rabbits: and also by some
ducks which will lay eggs nine of the twelve
months; and yet there be other ducks that
lay not longer than about one month. And
it is the rather to be believed, because you
shall scarce or never take a male carp without
a melt, or a female without a roe or spawn,
and for the most part very much, and especially
all the summer season. And it is
observed, that they breed more naturally in
ponds than in running waters, if they breed
there at all; and that those that live in rivers
are taken by men of the best palates to be
much the better meat.</p>

<p class='c006'>I told you that Sir Francis Bacon thinks
that the carp lives but ten years: but Janus
Dubravius has writ a book <i>Of Fish and
Fish Ponds</i>, in which he says, that carps
begin to spawn at the age of three years, and
continue to do so till thirty: he says also,
that in the time of their breeding, which is
in summer, when the sun hath warmed both
the earth and water, and so apted them also
for generation, that then three or four male
carps will follow a female; and that then,
she putting on a seeming coyness, they force
her through weeds and flags, where she lets
fall her eggs or spawn, which sticks fast to
the weeds; and then they let fall their melt
upon it, and so it becomes in a short time to be
a living fish: and, as I told you, it is thought
that the carp does this several months in the
year.—<i>Walton.</i></p>

woods, and build their nests on trees. The
female lays five or six eggs, much like those
of a raven. They feed on putrid flesh of all
sorts; likewise on eggs, worms, insects, and
various sorts of grain. They live together in

<p class='c006'>The deal and partners are determined by
cutting, as at whist. The dealer gives four
cards, by one at a time, to every player, and
either regularly, as he deals, or by one, two,
three, or four at a time, lays four, face upwards,
on the board, and after the first cards
are played, four others are to be dealt to each
person till the pack is out; but it is only in
the first deal that any cards are to be turned
up.</p>

<p class='c006'>The deal is not lost when a card is faced
by the dealer, unless in the first round, before
any of the four cards are turned up on the
table: but should a card be faced in the pack
before any of the said four are turned up, then
the deal must be begun again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any person playing with less than four
cards must abide by the loss, and should a
card be found under the table, the player
whose number is deficient is to take the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each person plays one card at a time, with
which he may not only take, at once, every
card of the same denomination on the table,
but likewise all that will combine therewith;
as, for instance, a ten takes not only every
ten, but also nine and ace, eight and deuce,
seven and three, six and four, or two fives;
and if he clear the board before the conclusion
of the game, he scores a point. When a player
cannot pair or combine, he is to put down a
card.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of tricks are not to be examined
or counted before all the cards are

<p class='c006'>The principal objects are to remember what
has been played; and when no pairs or combinations
can be made, to clear the hand of
court cards, which cannot be combined, and
are only of service in pairing or in gaining the
final sweep: but should no court cards be
left, it is best to play any small ones, except
aces, as thereby combinations are often prevented.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making pairs and combinations a preference
should generally be given to spades,
as obtaining a majority of them may save the
game.</p>

<p class='c006'>When three aces are out, take the first
opportunity to play the fourth, as it then cannot
pair; but when there is another ace
remaining, it is better even to play the little
cassino, that can only make one point, than
to risk the ace, which may be paired by the
opponent, and make a difference of two points;
and if great cassino and an ace be on the board,
prefer the ace, as it may be paired or combined,
but great cassino can only be paired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do not neglect sweeping the board when
an opportunity offers; always prefer taking
up the card laid down by the opponent, and
as many as possible with one card; endeavour
likewise to win the last cards or final sweep.</p>

<p class='c006'>While great or little cassino is in, avoid
playing either a ten or a deuce.</p>

<p class='c006'>When you hold a pair, lay down one of
them, unless when there is a similar card on
the table, and the fourth not yet out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Attend to the adversaries’ score, and, if
possible, prevent them from saving their lurch,
even though you otherwise seemingly get less
yourself, particularly if you can hinder them
from clearing the board.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the commencement of a game, combine
all the cards possible, for that is more difficult
than pairing; but when combination cannot
be made, do not omit to pair, and also carefully
avoid losing opportunities of making
tricks.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cast</span>, <i>v.</i> To admit of a form by casting or melting; to warp, to grow out
of form; to direct the hunting of a dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds are at fault, staring about
and trusting to their eyes and ears, a forward
cast is the least likely to regain the scent; the
place where they left is the most probable
spot for them to hit the scent, and hounds
knowing where they left the scent, will there
try to recover it, nor is a wide cast often to be
made without good reason; the scent should
be tried to be retrieved by crossing the line of
it, and a huntsman, by attending to this, will
not fail to make a good cast, if he observes the
point of the fox. When hounds cannot hit
off a fault by themselves, the first cast should
be speedy; the scent is then good, and hounds
not likely to go over it. Every huntsman
should adopt these rules; with a good scent
his cast should be quick, with a bad scent,
slow, and when hounds are picking along a
cold scent, he is not to cast them at all.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Hounds that are all well taught will cast
forward to a hedge of their own accord. Time
ought always to be allowed them to make
their own cast; it is impertinence in a huntsman
to prevent them, and prudence should
induce him to humour his hounds in the cast
they seem inclined to make, and either to
stand still, or trot round with them, as circumstances
may point out. Different countries
require different casts; in an open
country, wide casts are always necessary; in
casting round a flock of sheep, the whipper-in
ought to drive them the other way, lest they
keep running on before the hounds; in every
cast a huntsman should make it perfect one
way, before he tries another.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cast</span>, s. The act of casting or throwing; a throw; state of any thing cast
or thrown; the throw of dice; chance from the cast of dice; a mould,
a form; a shade, or tendency to any colour; manner, air, mien; a flight

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Casting-net</span>, <i>s.</i> A net to be thrown into the water by hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The casting-net may be successfully employed
in a certain depth of water, viz. gudgeon
net at four, and large meshed casting
net from six to eight feet: in the making
great attention must be paid to putting in the
widenings, or the net will never open freely,
however skilful the person that throws it. In
preparing it for casting, it must not be taken
upon the shoulder so short as to prevent the
leads having their proper swing, which is to
be aided by the corresponding turn of the
caster’s body, at the exact moment of delivering
it from his arm; and the first object is, to
let the leads all break the surface at once.
Many persons jerk one part of the net high in
the air (which assists the spreading), whilst
the other part of the lead line drops close to
the caster’s foot, making a variation of some
seconds in the fall of the different leads into
the water: fish must be very crowded, or
extremely sleepy, if they remain within the
curtailed range and slow sinking of a net so
cast. The nicety of the art is, to be able to
cover any particular spot, and to shape the
net accordingly; and no one can be deemed a
proficient, unless he is an ambidexter, and
throws from either shoulder, as the turning
and holes in a river may require.</p>

<p class='c006'>For carp or large fish, the mesh should be
an inch and three quarters, and the circumference
of the lead line not less than twenty-four
yards, and from that to twenty-eight; if
made of silk, it will sink more speedily, and
of course will admit to be thrown with success
in deeper water and more weeds. By
baiting a place in ponds with grains, worms, or
graves, the fish may be collected, and the
casting-net thrown over them: should there
be much mud, let the net remain quiet some
minutes, and the fish will rise from the mud,
into which they may have sunk themselves at
the noise of the net.</p>

<p class='c006'>N.B.—A piece of crumb of bread put into
the stomach of either carp or tench suspected
to be tainted with the mud, will absorb all

<p class='c006'>Castration is performed in various ways,
but in all it expresses the removal of the testicles:
there are methods of rendering the
animal impotent without the actual ablation
of these organs; for if by any other method
the secretion of the spermatic glands is prevented,
from which the uncontrollable sexual
excitements arise, the end is answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Castration by cauterization is the method
which has been principally practised among
us; and as it is that taught at our alma
mater, we may naturally suppose it has proved
worthy of the patronage it has received. It
is that I always practised, and was successful
with it. But this by no means proves it the
best; although good it must be, since I never
had an untoward case in it; and the more,
as, when I was called on to perform it, it was
usually on adult horses, mostly on aged ones.
Other plans may be still better: it is my duty,
assuming as I do, to be a teacher, to bring
them forward to view, that they may be compared
together. A preliminary observation
should be made previously to castrating, to see
that the horse has no hernia or rupture: such
cases have happened; and as in our method
we open a direct communication with the
abdomen, when the horse rises it is not improbable
that his bowels protrude until they
trail on the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a colt cannot be enticed with oats, &amp;c.,
he must be driven into a corner between two
steady horses, where, if a halter cannot be put
on, at least a running hempen noose can be
got round his neck; but, whichever is used, it
should be flat, or the struggles, which are
often long and violent, may bruise the neck,
and produce abscess or poll evil. When his
exertions have tired him, he may be then led
to the operating spot: here his attention
should be engaged while the hobbles are put
on, if possible; if not, a long and strong cart-rope,
having its middle portion formed into a
noose sufficiently large to take in the head
and neck, is to be slipped on, with the knotted
part applied to the counter or breast, and the
long pendent ends passed backwards between
the fore legs, and, as expressed by Mr. Percivall,
‘extended obliquely backward, carried
round the hind fetlocks within the hollows of
the heels, brought forward again on the outside,
passed under the collar rope, and a
second time carried backwards over the outside
of all, and extended to its full length in
a direct line behind the animal.’ Thus fettered,
Mr. Percivall says his hind feet may be
drawn under him towards the elbows; I have,
however, often found that, at the moment the
rope touches the heels, the colt either kicks
and displaces the rope, or altogether displaces
himself; but his attention can generally be
engaged by one fore leg being held up, or by
having his ear or muzzle rubbed, or even by
the twitch: if not, the rope may be carried
actually around each fetlock, which then
becomes a hobble; and this rope may be gradually
tightened: in this way I have succeeded
with very refractory colts; but it
requires very able assistants, and, if possible,
the man who has been used to the individual
colt should be present. In either way, as
soon as the rope is fixed, with a man to each
end of it, behind the colt, let them, by a sudden
and forcible effort in concert, approximate
his hind legs to his fore, and thus throw him.
Before the colt is cast, however, it should be
endeavoured to ascertain that he is free from
hernia: with an adult horse this is even more
necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being satisfied that no hernia exists on
either side, proceed to cast the horse, turning
him, not directly on the left side, but principally
inclining that way; and if possible let
the croup be very slightly elevated: it is
usual to place him directly flat on the left
side, but I have found the above rather more
convenient. Every requisite being at hand,
and as Hurtrel d’Arboval, with his usual
minuteness, observes, the operator, having his
scalpel between his teeth, should place himself
behind the horse, as the most convenient
way to perform his manipulations, and firmly
grasping the left testicle with his left hand,
and drawing it out so as to render the scrotum
tense, he should make an incision lengthways
of the bag, from its anterior to its posterior
part, or, as expressed by Hurtrel d’Arboval, in
the direction of the grand axis of the organ.
The incision may be carried at once through
the integuments, the thin dartos expansion,
and the vaginal coat of the testicles, by the
dexterous operator, with a sweep of the scalpel:
but with one less <i>au fait</i> at the operation,
it will be more prudent to make the first
incision through the scrotum and dartos only,
to the required extent, and then to do the
same by the vaginal coat, thus avoiding to
wound the testicle, which would produce violent
resistance, and give unnecessary pain.
The testicle, if the opening be sufficiently
large, will now slip out; but the operator
must be prepared, at the moment of so doing,
to expect some violent strugglings, more particularly
if he attempts to restrain the contractions
of the cremaster, and by main force
to draw out the testicle. Preparatory to this,
therefore, the twitch should be tightened;
the attendants, especially the man at the
head, must be on the alert, and the testicle
itself, at the time of this violent retraction of
the cremaster, should be merely held, but not
dragged in opposition to the contraction, otherwise
peritonitis itself might be the result from
any such violence. If the clams have been
put on over the whole, according to Mr. Percivall’s
method, they will assist in retaining
the retracting parts; but I must again offer a
caution, that they be not used with too much
pressure. The resistance having subsided,
provided the clams have been thus employed,
they must now be removed; or, if they have
not been previously in use, they must now be
taken in hand, and, being wadded with tow,
should be placed loosely on the cord, while
time is given to free the <i>vas deferens</i>, or
spermatic tube, which is seen continued from
the epididymis, from the grip of the pincers.
The Russians, Mr. Goodwin informs us, cut
it through when they operate. Hurtrel d’Arboval
does not note it in the French practice;
but humanity is much concerned in its
removal from pressure, from the excess of
pain felt when it is included. It is also
necessary, before the final fixing of the clams,
to determine on the part where the division
of the cord is to take place. To use Mr.
Percivall’s words, “If it be left too long, it is
apt to hang out of the wound afterwards, and
retard the process of union;” indeed, I have
known the end of it swell into a fungous excrescence,
which greatly embarrassed the practitioner
to destroy: on the other hand, if it
be cut very short, and the arteries happen to
bleed afresh after it has been relieved from
the clams, the operator will find it no easy
task to recover it from the retraction of the
cremaster. The natural length of the cord,
which will mainly depend on the degree of
the descent of the gland, will be our best
guide in this particular. The place of section
determined on and marked, close the clams
sufficiently tight to retain firm hold of the
cord, and to effectually stop the circulation
within it. There are now two modes of
making the division; the one is to sever it
with a scalpel, and then to sufficiently sear
the end of it so as to prevent a flow of
blood, avoiding, however, to burn it to a
cinder, as is sometimes done. The other,
and in some respects the preferable method,
is to employ an edged firing-iron, which is to
divide it by little crucial sawings, so that,
when the cord is separated, it shall not present
a uniform divided surface, but ragged
edges, which will more perfectly destroy the
mouths of the vessels, and tend to lessen the
chances of hæmorrhage. This done, loosen
the clams sufficiently to observe whether there
be any flow of blood; gently wipe the end of
the cord also with the finger, as sometimes an
accidental small plug gets within the vessel,
which afterwards is forced out, and therefore
had better be removed by this means and at
this time. Retain a hold on the clams a few
minutes longer; and while loosening them
gradually, observing to have an iron in readiness
again to touch the end of the cord, if any
blood makes its appearance. Satisfied on this
point, sponge the part with cold water, but by
no means dash it over them, as has been done;
neither is any external application necessary,
still less any resin seared on the end of the
cord, which can only irritate, and will never
adhere. On the after-treatment much difference
of opinion has existed, and even yet
exists. The powerful evidence of accumulated
facts has now convinced veterinarians
of both the necessity and propriety of some
motion for the newly-castrated horse as a
preventive of local congestion; such practice
is common in most countries but our own,
and seems salutary in all. Hurtrel d’Arboval,
thus impressed, recommends the horse, immediately
after the operation, to be led out to
walk for an hour, and it is a general plan in
France to walk such horses in hand an hour
night and morning. Mr. Goodwin, in proof
of its not being hurtful, informs us, that
whole studs of horses brought to St. Petersburgh
to be operated on, are immediately
travelled back a certain portion of the distance,
night and morning, until they arrive at
home. I have, therefore, no hesitation in
recommending a moderate degree of motion
in preference to absolute rest, as practised
among us: it is a plan which has long been
followed with success among our own cutters;
and perhaps our not adopting it before has
arisen from prejudice against whatever was
practised by illiterate persons, without reflecting
that, illiterate as they are, their employers
are not all so; and that, unless success attended
their practices, they would cease to be
employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would not operate,” says Mr. Percivall,
“during the season of changing the coat, nor
even just prior to that period, from fear of
interrupting the process, or checking it altogether;
neither would I choose frosty or
sultry weather: but, above all, it is advisable
to suspend the operation when the flies abound.

<p class='c006'>Each testicle should be taken out of the
scrotum separately, by an opening sufficiently
large, when a ligature should be applied,
moderately tight only, around the spermatic
chord, about an inch and a half beyond its
insertion into the testicle; the separation
should then be effected by the scalpel or
knife, between the ligature and testis. It is
sometimes performed without the ligature, by
making the division of the chord with a red-hot
knife, but the other is the neatest and
safest mode.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The castration of cats is sometimes practised
to keep them from roving, or to increase
their size. For this purpose nothing more is
requisite than to make a slight opening on
each side the scrotum, to slip out the two
testicles, and draw them away with the fingers.
The rupture alone of the spermatic
chord prevents hæmorrhage in them, and no
future inconvenience is felt. It is often found
difficult to secure a cat for this operation;
but it may be easily managed in two ways:—one
by putting the head and fore-quarters of
the animal into a boot; the other by rolling
his whole body lengthways in several yards
of towelling; but the former is the most
secure and simple, for no animal is more
intractable, as a surgical patient, than grimalkin:
though to administer medicines to a pig
beats the cat hollow, as an obstreperous operation.—<i>Blaine</i>—<i>Nimrod</i>—<i>Percivall.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The cat is a faithless domestic; though
gentle and frolicsome when young, they even
then possess an innate cunning, and perverse
disposition, which age increases, and education
only serves to conceal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The form and temperament of the cat’s
body perfectly correspond with his disposition;
he is handsome, light, adroit, cleanly, and
voluptuous; he loves ease, and searches out
the softest places for rest and repose. The cat
is very amorous. The passion of the female
continues nine or ten days, and commonly
happens only twice a year, in the spring and
autumn, but sometimes three and even four
times. They go with young 55 or 56 days,
and they usually have from four to six at a
litter. As the males are apt to devour their
progeny, the females commonly conceal themselves
when they litter, and if suspicious of a
discovery, they carry their young ones away
in their mouths and hide them in holes or
inaccessible places. After suckling them a
few weeks, the old one takes them mice or
small birds, to accustom them to eat flesh;
but by an unaccountable caprice, these very
mothers so tender and careful, become sometimes
so cruel and unnatural, as to devour
their offspring themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cats are without docility, and their scent,
which, in the dog is so eminent a quality, is
very indifferent, and therefore they hunt by
the eye only; neither do they properly pursue,
but rather lie in wait and attack the animals
by surprise; and after having played
with, and tormented them a long time, they
kill them without any necessity, even when
well fed, and in no want of prey to satisfy
their appetites.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most immediate physical cause of their
inclination to seize other animals by surprise,
comes from the advantage they receive from
the particular formation of their eyes. The
pupil in man, and many other animals, is
capable of a certain degree of contraction and
dilation; it enlarges a little when the light is
faint, and contracts when it becomes too
strong; in cats and nocturnal birds, as owls,
&amp;c., this contraction and dilation is so considerable
that the pupil, which in the dark is
large and round, becomes in the day long and
narrow like a line; and therefore these animals
see better in the night than in the day.
There is a perpetual contraction in the eye of
the cat during the day, and it is only by a
great effort that he can see in a strong light,
whereas, in the twilight, the pupil resumes
its natural form; he sees perfectly, and profits
from this superiority to know, attack, and
surprise his prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cats have less attachment to persons than
to houses. When taken to the distance of
a league or two they will return to their former
abode of their own accord. They fear
water, cold, and bad smells; they love to be
in the sun, and to lie in warm places; they
are very fond of perfumes, and willingly allow
themselves to be taken and caressed by
those who make use of them. They do not
come to their full growth in less than fifteen
or eighteen months, but they are capable of
engendering before the end of the first year,
and they can procreate all their lives, which
seldom exceeds eight or nine years; they are
notwithstanding, very lively and hardy, and
more nervous than most other animals which
live longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wild cat couples with the domestic
one, and they consequently form but one species.
It is not uncommon for both males
and females to quit their houses, when
they are proud to go into the woods to seek
wild cats, and afterwards return to their
former habitations; it is for this reason that
some of our domestic cats so entirely resemble
the wild ones. The greatest difference
between them is internally, the intestines of
the domestic cat being longer than those of
the wild cat, although the latter is much the
largest and strongest; his lips are also always
black, his ears more stiff, his tail larger, and
his colour more uniform.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general cats are not, like dogs, subject
to degenerate when transported into warm
climates. Their nature is indeed more constant,
and as their domestic state is neither so
entire, universal, nor perhaps so ancient as
that of the dog, it is not surprising that they
should have undergone less variation.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Besides this large and ferocious species, the
warrens upon the coast suffer much injury
from the common cat becoming wild and burrowing
in the rabbit-holes. They are sometimes
surprised and shot in the sand-banks,
or taken in traps; but they are generally too
wary to be approached—and hunting only by
night, during the day they sleep in their dens,
and are rarely met abroad.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some estimate of their numbers may be
formed, from the circumstance of five males
having been killed in a herdsman’s outhouse
which joined the warren. They had been
attracted there by one of their own species,
and the noise having alarmed the peasant, he
guessed the cause, and cautiously managed to
stop the hole by which they gained entrance,
with a <i>turf-cleave</i>. Knowing the value of
the capture, he kept guard upon the prisoners
till morning, and then despatched information
to the Lodge. My cousin, with his followers,
promptly repaired to the place, and surrounding
the barn with guns and greyhounds, bolted
the wild cats successively, until the whole
number were despatched. This chassé was
not only novel, but profitable. After the
death of their persecutors, the rabbits increased
prodigiously; but fears are entertained
that these destructive animals are become
once more abundant in the sand-banks.</p>

medicines, and of all cathartics Barbadoes

and chylification, by cleansing the intestines
and unloading the liver, and if the
animal is afterwards properly fed, will improve
his strength and condition in a remarkable
degree. Cathartics are always useful when
the appetite and digestion are bad, and this is
known by a voracious or depraved appetite,
both for food and for water; rumbling of the
bowels, and a frequent discharge of wind from
the anus. This is the case in a remarkable
degree with broken-winded horses, and generally
in such as have chronic cough, or are
crib-biters. They should not be given too
strong or too frequently, as they might thereby
weaken instead of strengthening the digestive
organs, and produce the effect they
were intended to remove. Cathartics should
always be made with soap, in the following
manner, and then, if given upon an empty
stomach, they will be carried off, and will not
be dissolved until they get into the large
bowels, where their effect is intended to be
produced: that is carrying off all the excrementitious
matter that may be lodged in
them. When given in this way they never
produce sickness or pain in the stomach, but
always operate without pain or danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chamois is a little larger than a goat,
but much superior in power and agility; the
strongest man could not hold one of a month
old; they bound from precipice to precipice to
a prodigious distance, gaining the loftiest summits,
and precipitating themselves from the
steepest rocks without fear. The chase of
this animal occupies a great part of the mountainous
population, and many perish annually
in the hazardous pursuit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Often the hunter, overtaken by a dark
mist, loses himself amongst the ice, and dies
of cold and hunger; or the rain renders the
rocks so slippery, that he is not able to reascend
them. In the midst of eternal snows,
braving all dangers, they follow the chamois
frequently by the marks of their feet; when
one is perceived at a distance, the hunter
creeps along till within reach of his gun, which
he rests on a rock, and is almost always sure
of his prey: thus the innocent beast, which
tranquilly feeds, perhaps enjoys the last moments
of its happy existence. But if his
watchful eye perceives the enemy, as is often
the case, he flies from rock to rock, “timor
addidit alas,” and the fatigues of the pursuer
begin, who traverses the snows, and climbs
the precipices, heedless of how he is to return.
Night arrives, yet the hopes of the morrow
reassure him, and he passes it under a rock.
There, without fire, without light, he draws
from his wallet a little cheese and oaten bread,
which he is obliged to break with a stone, or
with the hatchet he carries to cut his path in
the ice. This repast finished, he falls asleep
on his bed of snow, considering what route
the chamois has probably taken. At break of
day he awakens, insensible to the charms of
a beautiful morning, to the glittering rays
which silver the snowy summits of the mountains
around him, and, thinking only of his
prey, seeks fresh dangers. Thus they frequently
remain many days in these horrible
deserts, while their wives and families scarcely
dare to sleep, lest they should behold the
spirits of their dead husbands; for it is believed
that a chasseur, after his death, always appears
to the person who is most dear to him, to
make known where lie his mangled remains,
to beg the rites of burial.</p>

<p class='c006'>The char is a most beautiful and excellent
fish, and is a fish of prey. They generally
haunt deep cool lakes, and are seldom found
at the surface till late in autumn. When
they are at the surface, however, they will
take either fly or minnow. I have known
some caught in both these ways, and have
myself taken a char, even in summer, in one
of those beautiful, small, deep lakes in the
Upper Tyrol, near Nazereet; but it was where
a cool stream entered from the mountains,
and the fish did not rise, but swallowed the
artificial fly under water. The char is always,
in its colour, a very brilliant fish, but in different
countries there are many varieties in
the tint. I do not remember ever to have
seen more beautiful fish than those of Aussee,
which, when in perfect season, have the lower
fins and the belly of the brightest vermilion,
with a white line on the outside of the pectoral,
ventral, anal, and lower part of the caudal
fin, and with vermilion spots, surrounded by
the bright olive shade of the sides and back.
The dorsal fin in the char has eleven spines,
the pectoral fourteen, the ventral nine, the
anal ten, and the caudal twenty. I have
fished for them in many lakes, without success,
both in England and Scotland, and also
amongst the Alps; and I am told the only
sure way of taking them is by sinking a line
with a bullet and a hook having a live minnow
attached to it, in the deep water which
they usually haunt.—<i>Davy.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Charmer.</i>—That individuals have exercised
a powerful and unaccountable influence
on the most unmanageable animals, by means
which still remain a mystery, is certain. The
most remarkable case on record, is that of an
Irish blacksmith, who, by an undiscovered
agency, could subdue the most vicious horses.
He asserted, that this was effected by merely
whispering in the animal’s ear some potent spell,
and hence he gained the title of <i>the charmer</i>.
This power over the most desperate horses was
so often put to the test, that all doubt is idle.
He never refused to enter the stable of horses
that to all besides were unapproachable, and
after a short tête-à-tête, the animal would be
found trembling and subdued, and while every
limb appeared convulsed with terror <i>the charmer</i>
would pass under his belly, lift his feet,
or do any thing he was required. In his repeated
experiments upon the most savage
horses, <i>the charmer</i> never received any injury,
or failed in subduing the animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many attempts have been made to account
for the means by which this influence was obtained.
The general belief was, that some
powerful drug was passed by the exorciser into
the horse’s ear; but by what means was he
enabled to approach sufficiently close to a furious
brute to administer it?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is singular that though <i>the charmer</i> was
a miserable and poverty-stricken wretch, no
bribe could induce him to communicate the
charm—if it was one—and though immense
sums of money were offered, he carried the
secret with him to the grave!</p>

    <div>RULES FOR CHESS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. Move your pawns before your pieces, and
afterwards bring out the pieces to support
them; therefore the king’s, queen’s and bishops’
pawns should be the first played, in
order to open the game well.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Do not, therefore, play out any of your
pieces early in the game, because you thereby
lose moves, in case your adversary can, by
playing a pawn, make them retire, and he also
opens his game at the same time: especially
avoid playing your queen out, till your game
is tolerably well opened.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Avoid giving useless checks, and never
give any unless to gain some advantage, because
you may lose the move, if the adversary
can either take or drive your piece away.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Never crowd your game by having too
many pieces together, so as to prevent your
men advancing or retreating as occasion may
require.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. If your game should be crowded, endeavour
to free it by exchanges of pieces or pawns,
and castle your king as soon as convenient;
afterwards bring out your pieces, and attack
the adversary where weakest.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When the adversary plays out his pieces
before his pawns, attack them as soon as you
can with your pawns, by which you may crowd
his game and make him lose moves.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Never attack the adversary’s king without
a sufficient force; and if he attack yours,
and you cannot retaliate, offer exchanges; and
should he retire, when you present a piece to
exchange, he may lose a move. It also may
sometimes be expedient to act in this manner
in case of other attacks.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Play your men in guard of one another,
so that if any be taken, the enemy may also
be captured by that which guarded yours, and
endeavour to have as many guards to your
piece, as your adversary advances others upon
it; and, if possible, let them be of less value
than those he assails with. When you cannot
well support your piece, see if by attacking
one of his that is better, or as good, you
may not thereby save yours.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Never attack but when well prepared,
for thereby you open your adversary’s game,
and prepare him to pour in a strong attack
upon you, as soon as your weaker one is
over.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Never play till you have examined whether
you are free from danger by your adversary’s
last move; nor offer to attack till you
have considered what harm he would be able
to do you by his next moves, in consequence
of yours.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. When your attack is in a prosperous
way, never be diverted from it by taking any
piece, or other seeming advantage, your adversary
may purposely throw in your way, with
the intent that, by your taking the bait, he
might gain a move which would make your
design miscarry.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. When, in pursuing a well-laid attack,
you find it necessary to force your adversary’s
defence, with the loss of some pieces; if, upon
counting as many moves forward as you can,
you find a prospect of success, sacrifice a piece
or two to gain your end: these bold attempts
make the finest games.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. Never let your queen stand so before
the king, as that your adversary, by bringing
forwards a rook or a bishop, might check your
king if she were not there, for you could hardly
save her, or perhaps at best must sacrifice
her for an inferior piece; as for example: place
the white king on 61, the queen on 53; the
black king on 4, and the rook, on 16: which
last, if moved to 13, must be taken by the
white queen, who in return would be taken
by the black king, because the white queen
could not otherwise be moved without putting
the king on check to the black rook.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. Let not your adversary’s knight fork
your king and queen, or king and rook, or
queen and rook, or your two rooks, at the same
time; for in the two first cases, the king being
forced to go out of check, the queen or the
rook must be lost; and in the two last a rook
must be lost, at best, for a worse piece. Place
the white queen on 5, the rook on 7, and a
black knight on 37. The latter piece, if
moved to 22, will fork both the queen and
rook, and consequently one of them must be
lost for the knight.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. Take care that no guarded pawn of your
adversary’s fork two of your pieces: knights
and rooks are particularly liable to this mode
of attack; also guard against either a check by
discovery, or a stale-mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. When the kings have castled on different
sides of the board, attack with the pawn
you have on that side where the adversary has
castled, advancing the pieces, especially the
queen and rooks to support them; and if the
adversary’s king have three pawns on a line in
front, he should not stir them till forced to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. Endeavour to have a move in ambuscade;
that is, place the queen, bishop, or
rook behind a pawn, or a piece, in such a
manner, as that, upon playing that pawn, or
piece, you discover a check upon your adversary’s
king, and consequently may often get a
piece, or some other advantage by it. Suppose
the black king on 6, a white bishop on
41, and a pawn on 34; by moving the pawn
to 26, a check by the white bishop is discovered
upon the black king.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. Never guard an inferior piece or pawn
with a better, if you can do it with a pawn,
because that better piece may in such a case
be, as it were, out of play.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. A pawn pushed on, and well supported,
often costs the adversary a piece; but one
separated from the others is seldom of any
value. And whenever you have gained a
pawn, or other advantage, and are not in
danger of losing the move thereby, make as
frequent exchanges as you can.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. If each player have three pawns upon
the board, and no piece, and you have a pawn
on one side of the board, and the other two
on the other side, and your adversary’s 3 are
opposite to your 2, march with your king to
take his pawns; and if he move to support
them, go on to queen with your single pawn;
and if he attempt to hinder it, take his pawns,
and push yours to queen; that is, to move a
pawn into the adversary’s back row, in order
to make a queen, when the original is lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. At the latter end of the game, each
party having only three or four pawns on different
sides of the board, the kings are to
endeavour to gain the move, in order to win
the game: for example—the white king placed
on 54, and the black king on 37, white would
gain the move by playing to 53, or black to
38, and in both cases the adverse king would
be prevented from advancing.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. When the adversary has no more than
his king and one pawn on the board, and you
a king only, you can never lose that game if
you bring and keep your king opposite to
your adversary’s, when he is immediately
either before or on one side of his pawn, and
only one house between the kings. This
must then either be a drawn game, or if the
opponent persist in his endeavours to win, he
will lose by a stale-mate, by drawing you
upon the last square.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. When your adversary has one pawn on
the rook’s line, with a king and bishop against
a king only, and his bishop is not of the colour
that commands the corner-house his
pawn is going to, if you can get your king
into that corner, you cannot lose that game,
but may win by a stale-mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. When you have only your queen left
in play, and your king happens to be in that
position of stale-mate, keep giving check to
your adversary’s king, always taking care not
to check him where he can interpose any of
his pieces that make the stale: by so doing,
you will at last force him to take your queen,
and then you win the game by being in stale-mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. Never cover a check with a piece that
a pawn pushed upon it may take, for fear of
only getting that pawn for it: put a black
rook on 7, and a pawn on 40; the white king
on 63, and a knight on 61: the white king
being on a check to the rook, if the check be
covered by moving the white knight to 56,
the black pawn could then be moved to 48,
and take the knight.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. Do not crowd your adversary’s king
with your pieces, lest you inadvertently give
a stale-mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>27. Do not be too much afraid of losing a
rook for an inferior piece; though a rook is
better than any other, except the queen, yet
it seldom comes into play, so as to operate,
until the end of the game; and it is generally
better to have a worse piece in play than a
superior out.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. When you have moved a piece, which
your adversary drives away with a pawn, that
is a bad move, your enemy gaining a double
advantage. At this nice game no move can
be indifferent. Though the first move may
not be much, between equally good players,
yet the loss of one or two more, after the
first, makes the game almost irretrievable:
but if you can recover the move, or the attack
(for they both go together), you are in a
fair way of winning.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. If ever your game be such, that you
have scarce any thing to play, you have either
brought out your pieces wrong, or, which is
worse, not at all; for if you have brought
them out right, you must have variety enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. Do not be much afraid of doubling a
pawn: two in a direct line are not disadvantageous
when surrounded by three or four
others; three together are strong, (as three
white pawns on 28, 35 and 37;) but four,
(as 44 in addition) that make a square, with
the help of other pieces, well managed, form
an invincible strength, and probably may produce
you a queen: on the contrary, two
pawns, with an interval between (as on 35
and 37) are no better than one; and if you
should have three over each other in a line
(as 26, 34, and 42) your game cannot be in a
worse situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. When a piece is so attacked that it is
difficult to save it, give it up, and endeavour
to annoy your enemy in another place; for it
often happens, that whilst your adversary is
pursuing a piece, you either get a pawn or
two, or such a situation as ends in his destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>32. Supposing your queen and another
piece are attacked at the same time, and by
removing your queen, you must lose the
piece, if you can get two pieces in exchange
for her, rather do that than retire; for the
difference is more than the worth of a queen;
besides, you preserve your situation, which is
often better than a piece; when the attack
and defence are thoroughly formed, if he who
plays first be obliged to retire by the person
who defends, that generally ends in the loss
of the game on the side of him who attacks.</p>

<p class='c006'>33. Do not aim at exchanges without reason;
a good player will take advantage of it,
to spoil your situation, and mend his own:
but when you are strongest, especially by a
piece, and have not an immediate check-mate
in view, then every time you exchange, your
advantage increases. Again, when you have
played a piece, and your adversary opposes
one to you, exchange directly, for he wants
to remove you: prevent him, and do not lose
the move.</p>

<p class='c006'>34. Every now and then examine your
game, and then take your measures accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>35. At the latter end of the game, especially
when both queens are off the board,
the kings are capital pieces; do not let your
king be idle; it is by his means, generally,
you must get the move and the victory.</p>

<p class='c006'>36. As the queen, rooks, and bishops
operate at a distance, it is not always necessary
in your attack to have them near your
adversary’s king; they do better at a distance,
cannot be driven away, and prevent a stale-mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>37. When there is a piece you can take,
and that cannot escape, do not hurry; see
where you can make a good move elsewhere,
and take the piece at leisure.</p>

<p class='c006'>38. It is not always right to take your adversary’s
pawn with your king, for very often
it happens to be a safeguard and protection to
him. Place a black rook on 5, with a pawn
on 45, and the white king on 53, and he will
be sheltered by the black pawn from the
attack of the rook.</p>

<p class='c006'>39. When you can take a man with different
pieces, consider thoroughly with which
you had best take it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>APPLICATION TO SOME OF THE FOREGOING RULES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. Whether you play the open or close
game, bring out all your pieces into play before
you begin the attack; for if you do not
and your adversary should, you will always
attack, or be attacked, at a great disadvantage;
this is so essential, that you had better
forego an advantage than deviate from it; and
no person can ever play well who does not
strictly practise this. In order to bring out
your pieces properly, push on your pawns
first, and support them with your pieces, by
which your game will not be crowded, and all
your pieces will be at liberty to play and assist
each other, and so co-operate towards obtaining
your end; and either in your attack
or defence, bring them out so as not to be
driven back again.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When you have brought out all your
pieces, which you will have done well, if you
have your choice on which side to castle;
then consider thoroughly your own and adversary’s
game, and not only resolve where to
castle, but likewise to attack where you appear
strongest, and your enemy weakest. By
this it is probable you will be able to break
through your adversary’s game, in which some
pieces must be exchanged. Now pause again,
and survey both games attentively, and do not
let your impetuosity hurry you on too far; at
this critical juncture (especially if you still
find your adversary very strong) rally your
men, and put them in good order for a second
or third attack, still keeping them close and
connected, so as to be of use to each other.
For want of this method, and a little coolness,
an almost sure victory is often snatched
out of a player’s hands, and a total overthrow
ensues.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. At the last period of the game, observe
where your pawns are strongest, best connected,
and nearest to queen; likewise mind how
your adversary’s pawns are disposed, and compare
these things together; and if you can
get to queen before him, proceed without hesitation;
if not, hurry on with your king to
prevent him: I speak now, as supposing all
the noblemen are gone; if not, they are to
attend your pawns, and likewise to prevent
your adversary from going to queen.—<i>Vide</i>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_111.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This fish takes its name from the head,
not only in our own but other languages; we
call it chub, according to Skinner, and from
the old English cop, a head; the French,
testard; the Italians, capitome: in different
parts of England this fish is called cheven,
nob, or botling; he much resembles the carp,
but is of a longer form; the body is oblong,
rather round, and of a pretty equal thickness
in the greater part of the slope; the scales
are large; the irides silvery; the cheeks of
the same colour; the head and back of a
deep dusky green; the sides silvery, but in
the summer, yellow; the belly white; the
pectoral fins of a pale yellow; the ventral
and anal fins, red; the tail forked, of a
brownish hue, but tinged with blue at the
end; it is altogether a handsome fish, will
sometimes weigh upwards of five pounds; but
Salvianus speaks of them as increasing to
eight or nine. The flesh of the chub is not
in much esteem, being coarse, and when out
of season, full of small hairy bones; the head
and throat are the best parts, taking care to
have the latter well washed and cleansed
from the grass and weeds usually in it. The
roe is exceedingly good, and this fish stewed
as carp, will, it is said, deceive a connoisseur.</p>

<p class='c006'>The haunts of the chub are in rivers whose
bottoms are of sand or clay, or which are
bounded by clayey banks; particularly in
deep holes, shaded by trees, weeds, &amp;c. They
frequently float on the surface, and are sometimes
in streams and deep waters where the
currents are strong; in ponds fed by a rivulet
they grow to a large size. They spawn in
April, and are most in perfection in December
and January, having then very few of the
hairy bones aforementioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chub does not afford the angler so
much diversion as the trout, from being so
dull a fish on the hook, and when once struck
becoming soon tired; but he bites so eagerly,
that, when he takes the bait, his jaws are
heard to chop like those of the dog, and
having a very wide leather mouth, and his
teeth in his throat, there is little danger of his
breaking hold; to fish for him, the angler should
have a stout long rod, a strong line (if he uses a
reel he will be enabled the better to fish under
bushes) with a yard or more of the best silk-worm-gut
at bottom, a hook proportioned to
the bait used, a swan-quill float, and the line
so shotted, eight or ten inches from the hook,
as to sink the float to a quarter of an inch
above the surface; the same ground-bait to be
used as for the carp, and the hook baited with
a sufficient quantity of salmon’s roe (boiled a
little) to fill up the bend properly; this rightly
done is a tempting bait. The large ones are
to be caught by dibbing, very early in the
morning, with the brown beetle or cockchafer:
by day-break the angler should be at
the river, and after baiting his hook, let him
move it two or three times near the surface,
as in the act of flying; then let it softly drop
on the water, shaking the rod gently, which
will cause the appearance of its struggling to
escape: this attracts the chub, who are so
fond of this bait that they will rise two or
three at a time to seize it; the landing-net in
this fishing should never be forgotten, as the
places most likely for success in taking chub,
are those where the angler cannot get to the
water-side to land them with his hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another way of dibbing is in a hot summer
day with a grasshopper. In any hole where
they haunt, many of them will be seen basking
themselves near the surface; the rod must
be both long and of considerable strength; the
line strong, and in length about a yard. Bait
the hook with a grasshopper, and the angler
must conceal himself behind some bush or
tree, and remain as motionless as possible, for
the chub is so fearful, that the smallest shadow
of a bird flying over, or of the rod, makes
him sink to the bottom, but he will soon rise
again. Having selected the largest chub, let
him move the rod with great slowness and
caution, and drop the bait gently upon the
water, three or four inches before it, and he
will infallibly take it: there is no danger of
securing the chub, if allowed play enough
before it is attempted to be taken out, being
one of the leather-mouthed fishes, wherein a
hook seldom loses its hold.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chub will take gentles, wasps, maggots
(which must be baked in an oven before used).
Paste of fine new white bread (without being
made wet), worked up in the hand, and tinged
with vermilion as near as possible to the
colour of salmon’s roe; from the hook this
paste will not easily wash off, and is a most
killing bait; but the best baits for bottom or
float-fishing for this fish, are old Cheshire
cheese, (such as, without crumbling, will
mould in the hand), and the pith from the
back bone of an ox, with the outward so carefully
taken off as not to bruise the inward
skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>At every season of the year, the former of
these is good; but the latter end of summer,
and all the winter, are the preferable times for
both. In baiting with the cheese, put a round
lump, the size of a cherry, on a large hook, so
as to cover the bend, and some way up the
shank; fish six inches from the bottom, or in
cold raw weather the bait may lie on the
ground; but if the hole has not been ground-baited,
the depth is immaterial; when there is
a bite, the float will very swiftly be drawn under
water, strike immediately and give him play,
holding a tolerable tight line, to keep the fish
clear of weeds and stumps, which at sight of
the angler he will endeavour to get at for
shelter, and if not properly managed, he will
break the tackle. In the spring of the year
the chub will take a marsh, or small red-worm;
in May, June, and July, flies, beetles,
snails (the black ones with the belly slit to
shew the white;) in August, pastes: the large
chub will also take minnows, small dace, and
gudgeons, angled with in the same manner as
for perch; and the latter bait used likewise in
trolling for pike, the hook not so heavily loaded
upon the shank. They gorge immediately
upon taking the bait. Their biting times are
chiefly from before sunrise until nine in the
morning, and from four until after sunset in
the summer, (some will, by chance, take at
any time of the day when mild and cloudy);
and in the winter the middle of the day is
best; remembering that in hot weather, they
are to be fished for at or near the top, and
not deeper than mid-water, and in cold, close
to or upon the bottom; and that the main
point in taking this fish is, the angler’s keeping
himself out of sight.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye cinnamon colour.</i>—Take about
three pints of <i>right stone crottle</i>, (common
lichen) about four or six chips of
young fustic, and a good flake of walnut-bark;
put them down in eight quarts of
water; when your time of boiling is half
done, add a pint of crottle and eight or
ten fustic chips; make four very thick canvass
bags, ten inches broad and fourteen
or fifteen inches long—wash them when
made, lest they should hurt your colour.
Divide one pound of fur into four parts,
and put a part into each bag; tie a leaden
weight to each bag, at both ends, allowing
two inches of string, to admit the bags to rise
that height from the bottom, lest they should
burn; place them in the pot so that they may
not entangle with each other, put in your
frame without the lid, and fill the pot with
water. It will take from twelve to eighteen
hours boiling; divide that time as to the
drawing each shade; look at them every hour
by lifting out a bag, and if you see a shade to
your eye, draw a part and put down your bag
again: in this case you should put half a
pound of fur in your bags. There are many
shades of cinnamon wanting in fishing. Thus
you have your colour nice and clean. The
reason of using the bags is the difficulty of
carding the crottle out of the fur; and the
reason of boiling so long, is, that the bag in
some degree prevents the dye.</p>

you ruin all: thus you may draw two shades

nail attached to the end of each, frequently
turns in and wounds the flesh; or, by its
hook-like shape, it catches into every thing
the dog treads on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>horny claws</i> or <i>nails</i> of the true toes
are also subject, when dogs have not sufficient
exercise, to become preternaturally long, and,
by turning in, to wound these toes likewise,
and lame the dog. It is better to saw them
off with a very fine and hard cockspur saw,
and then to file them smooth; avoiding to cut
them too close, or the vascular part may

“Walking one day along the shore of Holy
Island, off the coast of Northumberland, I
disturbed an ash-coloured sanderling (<i>Calidris
islandica</i>, <span class='sc'>Steph.</span>), which flew heedlessly,
and as if injured. On shooting the
bird, I found that it was covered with vermin,
more especially about the head; so much so,
that the poor thing must have fallen a victim
to their tormenting ravages. On further examination,
I found that it had lost one of its
legs, so that it was from its incapability to rid
itself of these insects that their extraordinary
increase was to be attributed. Poultry (the
same naturalist remarks) which run about in
stony or paved yards, wear away the points of
their claws by friction and digging, which
renders them unfit to penetrate their coating
of feathers; they are, therefore, more covered
with vermin, and, in consequence, more sickly
than fowls from the country.”—<i>Ainsworth.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Clergy</span>, <i>s.</i> A man in holy orders, not a laic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The propensity of the clergy to follow the
secular pastimes, and especially those of hunting
and hawking, is frequently reprobated by
the poets and moralists of the former times.
Chaucer, in his Canterbury Tales, makes the
monk much better skilled in riding and hunting,
than in divinity. The same poet, afterwards,
in the Ploughman’s Tale, takes occasion
to accuse the monks of pride, because they
rode on coursers like knights, having their
hawks and hounds with them. In the same
tale he severely reproaches the priests for their
dissolute manners, saying, that many of them
thought more upon hunting with their dogs,
and blowing the horn, than of the service they
owed to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bishops and abbots of the middle ages
hunted with great state, having a large train
of retainers and servants; and some of them
are recorded for their skill in this fashionable
pursuit. Walter, bishop of Rochester, who
lived in the thirteenth century, was an excellent
hunter, and so fond of the sport, that at
the age of fourscore he made hunting his sole
employment, to the total neglect of the duties
of his office. In the succeeding century an
abbot of Leicester surpassed all the sportsmen
of the time in the art of hare-hunting; and
even when these dignitaries were travelling
from place to place, upon affairs of business,
they usually had both hounds and hawks in
their train. Fitzstephen assures us, that
Thomas à Becket, being sent as ambassador
from Henry II. to the court of France, assumed
the state of a secular potentate; and took
with him dogs and hawks of various sorts, such
as were used by kings and princes.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of the Reformation, the see of
Norwich, only, was in the possession of no less
than thirteen parks, well stocked with deer
and other animals for the chase. At the end
of a book of Homilies in MS., in the Cotton
Library, written about the reign of Henry VI.,
is a poem containing instructions to priests in
general, and requiring them, among other
things, not to engage in “hawkynge, huntynge,
and dawnsynge.”—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>I should certainly prefer seeing a horse of
mine with a fine short coat without the aid of
clipping; but if that were not to be accomplished,
I would certainly have him clipped.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>“A very dangerous effect of debility, or
being out of condition,” says Mr. Smith, p. 18,
“is, that the subject has a long rough coat,
which retains the perspiration excited by exercise;
and even in cold weather, when the
exercise is not such as to excite sweat, the insensible
perspiration which is constantly issuing
from the extremities of the cutaneous
vessels is condensed among the hair, and appears
on the surface like dew; whereby cold
is produced on the surface of the body, occasioning
too great a determination of blood to
the lungs, and other important viscus, which is
always in proportion to the diminution of the
cutaneous perspiration.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>“I must own myself a very decided advocate
for the clipping of hunters, having observed
such horses to have had a most decided
advantage, during the last season, with the
Cheshire, Sir Richard Puleston’s and Sir Thomas
Stanley’s fox-hounds, as well as with the
Chester harriers, now under the very superior
management of Captain Puleston. Experience
and observation are, in this matter, worth a
bushel of <i>à priori</i> reasoning; but scientific argument
and rational explanation are not wanting
to aid and enforce the practice of clipping.
In the first place and to begin with the most
trifling reason—the horse is a pound lighter;
and the coat affording little resistance to the
brush, your groom is not half so soon fatigued
in dressing, and lays double strength upon the
surface. This causes a greater determination
to the extreme vessels, and the insensible perspiration
is proportionably increased. We invariably
find a connexion between the action
of the skin and that of the intestines; and this
is sufficiently evident in a well-groomed horse;
the lacteals of the bowels seem to have a corresponding
action communicated to them—they
absorb and select the pabulum of the blood
with increased vigour—the secreting vessels of
the stomach furnish the gastric solvent more
abundantly—the liver more readily acts, and
separates those vitiated parts which have fulfilled
their duties in the circulation, and require
to be thrown out of the system, but in
their transit, in the form of bile, perform other
important uses, in stimulating the intestines to
that regular peristaltic motion which secures a
change of particles to the vessels which absorb
the nourishment for the blood. But the abdominal
viscera do not alone benefit by the
more intimate friction which is admitted to the
skin of a clipped horse. The lungs are wonderfully
assisted the more the insensible perspiration
is increased: the less work for them
to accomplish, the less will be the determination
to the internal vessels; and consequently
the less risk of congestion in the minute bronchial
ramifications of the lungs.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Were I to give a good price for a promising
young horse for the purpose of making him a
hunter, and keeping him for my own use, and
a man were to come into my stable and tell
me he would give me one-third of his value if
I would have him clipped, I would refuse his
offer. I look upon clipping as nothing but a
bad substitute for good grooming, and an operation
attended with several disadvantages. In
the first place, when once performed it must
always be repeated; and in the second, it is a
constant eye-sore to a person who is fond of
seeing his horses looking well, as it effectually
destroys that bloom on the skin which is not
only so beautiful, but also so confirmatory of
the sound health of the animal; and lastly, by
depriving him of the protection which a short
thick coat, lying close to the body, affords him
against the scratching of thorns and briars, it
very frequently causes a horse to refuse rough
places in a fence which he would not have refused
before. It is a remedy to be sure, or at
least a palliative; but I had rather a horse of
mine should endure the disease it is intended
to relieve, until I could bring a better medicine
to his aid; and were I to become possessed
of a hunter which required clipping, I would
put up with his long coat and evening sweats,
until, by strengthening his general system, I
got rid of the latter, to which the former is
by no means a certain contributor. It is quite
possible—and I have an instance at this moment
in my own stable—for a horse to have a
long coat (and some horses at certain periods
will not wear a short coat), but still to look
very blooming to the eye, <i>and dry immediately
after a sweat</i>, as is the case with the
horse I speak of. I am not weak enough to
suppose that clipping will not continue to be
practised because one individual disapproves of
it; but I may be allowed to say, I will never
after this year practise it again. The horse I
had clipped last winter must now, I fear, be
clipped again, for I abhor the sight of him in
his present state—his coat somewhat resembling
a poodle dog; but his evening sweats are
got rid of by the method I pursued with him
in the summer. Clipping may be all very
well for those who cannot, or will not, get
their horses into condition by other means;
and to such only do I recommend it.—<i>Nimrod</i>—<i>Smith</i>—<i>Equestris.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Clysters of broth, gravy, or gruel, will afford
a very considerable quantity of nourishment:
a small proportion of opium, as twenty
drops of laudanum, may be given in each, to
assist in retaining it within the bowels. <i>Astringent</i>
clysters, as starch, rice-water, alumine
whey, infusion of red roses, or of oak-bark,
are useful in violent loosenesses. <i>Purging</i>
clysters may be made of veal or mutton
broth, with a portion of salt or moist sugar
added: the effect may be still further quickened
by adding castor oil or Epsom salts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Clysters are very easily administered to
dogs, and no apparatus is so convenient for
the purpose as the patent syringe of Reid: a
good domestic apparatus is found in the common
pipe and bladder also. The liquid used
should be warm, but not hot; the quantity
from three ounces, to six or eight, according
to the size of the dog, &amp;c.: the pipe should
be greased previously to its introduction, and
the tail held down a minute or two after its
removal.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In flatulent colic it is essentially useful, and
it is from this circumstance being too little
known, or not attended to, that flatulent colic
sometimes terminates in inflammation, and
death. (<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Carminatives</span>.) In suppression
or retention of urine, or in difficulty of staling,
a clyster is the best remedy that can be employed.
In short there is scarcely a disease
to which horses are liable, in which clysters
may not be advantageously employed, either
as a principal remedy, or as an auxiliary to
others. The clyster syringes commonly employed
are worse than useless, because they
sometimes prevent a clyster being given when
it is absolutely necessary, especially in flatulent
colic. The clyster-pipe and bladder is
the only effectual apparatus I have seen.
The pipe should be one inch in bore, and
fifteen inches in length. The quantity of
liquid employed should be five or six quarts,
and consist only of warm water, with half
a pound of salt dissolved in it. There
is sometimes difficulty found in introducing
the pipe, generally from hard excrement in
the straight gut; sometimes, however, from
the bladder being distended with urine. In
such cases patience and care are necessary to
exhibit the clyster effectually, and it may
almost always be accomplished without raking
or drawing out the hard excrement with the
hand; there is no objection, however, to this
operation, and when a clyster-pipe is not at
hand, it must be employed as a substitute for
a clyster. (<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Raking</span>.) The simple emollient
clyster should be thin gruel, or warm
water only. The anodyne or opiate clyster
should be composed of three or four ounces
of tincture of opium in two quarts of gruel,
or warm water. Gibson gave half an ounce
of solid opium dissolved in water, as a clyster
to a horse in locked jaw, with success. Nourishing
clysters are composed of arrow-root,
or wheat-flour gruel with sugar, or broth
thickened with flour. Tincture of opium is
an useful addition to such clysters, especially
in locked jaw.—<i>Blaine.</i>—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cock-fighting</i> is a sport of great antiquity.
It is supposed to have first originated with the
Greeks; and that at one period it became so
prevalent amongst them, that families of extensive
property were reduced thereby to the
lowest ebb of fortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the Romans were so fond of imitating
the Greeks, in their bad as well as good customs,
it came to them as a mere gambling
sport. According to Herodian, the first cause
of contention between the two brothers, Bassianus
and Geta, sons of the Emperor Septimus
Severus, happened in their youth, about
cock-fighting, which they had probably seen
in Greece, whither they had often accompanied
their father.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not known when this custom was first
introduced into England, but undoubtedly by
the Romans. The bird was here before the
landing of Julius Cæsar; but no notice of
cock-fighting occurs earlier than the time of
William Fitz Stephen, who wrote the life of
the Archbishop Becket in the reign of Henry
II., and describes it as a sport of school-boys
on Shrove Tuesday. From this time it continued
in a fluctuating state; sometimes in
vogue, at others, disapproved; and prohibited,
39 Edward III.; also in the reign of Henry
VIII., and in 1569. It has been termed a
royal diversion; and the cock-pit at Whitehall
was erected by a crowned head for the more
magnificent celebration of it. There were
other pits in Drury Lane and Jewin Street.
It was prohibited by Oliver Cromwell, March
31, 1654.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the breed of game fowls,
the criterion of blood in these animals, before
trial, is “fineness of feathers,” richness of
plumage, “cleanness of feet,” and keenness
of aspect. But there have been introduced
of late years some varieties quite distinctly
marked from the game fowls of old times;
viz., “top knots” and “muffy heads,” which
were quite unknown to our ancestors.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cock is in his prime at two years old,
and retains his vigour to his fifth year: the
hen somewhat longer. Cockers breed in-and-in
without scruple. The following is
Mr. Sketchley’s description of a brood cock,
in full health and vigour:—“A ruddy complexion,
feathers close and short, not cold or
dry: flesh firm and compact, full breasted,
yet taper and thin behind; full in the girth,
well coupled, lofty and spiring, with a good
thigh; the beam of his leg very strong, a
quick large eye, strong beak, crooked, and
big at setting on.” Such a one, not more
than two years old, to be put to early pullets,
or a blooming stag with two-year old hens;
and when a cock, with pullets of his own
getting. Uniformity of colours is generally
sought for, and the hens selected of similar
plumage to that of the cock; the same of
shape, which is a greater object in the hen,
than size; only she should be lofty crested,
short and close feathered, with clean, sinewy,
blood-like legs. Shropshire and Cheshire
have long been famous for their breed of
game cocks; and the Shropshire reds are in
particular high estimation. There was formerly
in Staffordshire a famous breed of
cocks, of a perfect jet black, gipsey faced,
black legs, and rather elegant than muscular;
lofty in fighting, close in feather, and well
shaped. This breed soon degenerated; and,
I presume, is now extinct. The following
procreative comparison of Mr. Sketchley speaks
volumes:—</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that a game cock that happened
to be on board Rodney’s ship on the memorable
12th of April, during that glorious
action, exhibited the most undaunted courage,
by crowing and clapping his wings.—<i>Vide</i>
<i>Hoyle</i>, <i>article</i> <span class='sc'>Game Cock</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cocks, when they crow at unwonted hours,
often foretel a change of weather. We have
often noticed this before rain. During the
calm, still, dry, dark, and warm weather,
sometimes occurring in the winter months, and
which may be called the halcyon days of our
climate, cocks keep a constant crowing all
night and day. There appear to be three
principal cock-crowings in ordinary weather,
namely, about midnight or soon after, about
three in the morning, and at daybreak; the
latter is never omitted. We have noticed,
however, that when cocks crow all day, in
summer particularly, a change to rain has
frequently followed.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Cocks and hammers.</i>—If the sportsman
has no objection to its clumsy appearance, I
should be inclined to recommend the solid
cock which falls on its end, instead of being
stopped in the middle by the lock plate. It
will therefore admit of main springs as strong
as you please: and, by this means, add considerably
to quickness in firing. But if you
have very strong main springs, with the common
cock, the resistance from the hammer
spring, to prevent its breaking, must be so
great, that you would soon wear out hammers,
by being obliged to use an immoderate quantity
of flints. With this another part of the
lock also is safer, because the solid cock is
received on a firm support annexed to the
pan; while the one on the other construction
suddenly catches the lock-plate, and is therefore
liable to jar, and break either the tumbler
itself, or the pin of the tumbler. A
solid cock has many other advantages, from
its durability and strength: it is proof against
all awkward hands, and particularly desirable
on guns which are liable to meet with rough
usage in a boat.—<i>Sporting Repository</i>—<i>Hawker</i>—<i>Foster.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cock</span>, <i>v.</i> To set erect, to hold upright; to fix the cock of a gun for a
discharge; to raise hay in small heaps.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cocker</span>, <i>s.</i> One who follows the sport of cock-fighting: a small spaniel.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Cocker</i>—(<i>Canis extrarius, Var. B.</i>
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—This dog is much smaller than the
springing spaniel, and is generally used for
woodcock and snipe shooting. His diminutive
size peculiarly fits him for ranging in low
and thick coverts, for which purpose nature
seems peculiarly to have adapted him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cocker differs from the springer in
having a shorter and more compact form, a
rounder head, and a shorter muzzle; the ears
are very long, the limbs are short and strong;
the tail is generally truncated and more bushy;
and the hair of the cocker, over his whole
body, is more curled than that of the springer.
He varies in colour from liver and white, red,
red and white, black and white, all liver-coloured,
and not unfrequently black, with
tanned legs and muzzle.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful and lively dog seems to have
been produced, originally, by a cross between
the small water spaniel and the springer, for
he not only resembles the figure of the latter,
but also has many of his habits, combined
with the lively and active disposition of both.
From the beauty and temper of the cocker,
the breed has become very generally diffused
throughout the kingdom, and he is more frequently
a companion in the parlour than
used in the sports of the field. He is extremely
common in many parts of Sussex,
from which, in the south, he has obtained
the name of the Sussex Spaniel. There has
long been a beautiful breed of this dog in the
possession of the Duke of Marlborough and
his friends, which is preserved in great purity;
these are invariably red and white, with very
long ears, short noses, and black and sparkling
eyes; they are active and indefatigable in the
chase, and are consequently held in great estimation
among sportsmen.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Maxwell, of Edinburgh, has long
had an extremely beautiful breed of cockers;
most of them have been black, with tanned
cheeks and legs, and ears nearly seven inches
in length; they are of a small size, but they
are lively and handsome little creatures.</p>

<p class='c006'>In his general qualifications the cocker
differs but little from the springer, except
that he is decidedly more active: he appears
also to have a more acute sense of smelling,
and pursues game with an enthusiasm amounting
to ecstacy. From his lively temperament,
he does not tire so soon as the springer, however
long the labour of the day may be.</p>

<p class='c006'>From an innate principle of this industrious
little animal, he gives the loudest proofs
of his ecstatic delight upon finding, or even
coming upon the scent, foot, or haunt of
game; it is also his determined resolution to
persevere until he has fairly driven them from
covert. Consequently all sportsmen who take
the field with cockers, are compelled to be on
the alert, and to keep pace with the progress
which the dogs make in the wood, otherwise
they are sure to lose the greater part of the
game. They may even travel many a weary
mile without obtaining a successful shot, as it
is the unalterable nature of these dogs to
spring, flush, or start all the game before
them; and they pursue, without distinction,
hare, pheasant, partridge, woodcock, snipe,
quail, and plover. It thus becomes necessary
to hunt them within gun-shot of covert, and
bells or gingles should be placed inside the
collars, if the wood is extensive, to prevent
them from beating too wide, and to keep them
within call of the whistle.</p>

<p class='c006'>The springer and cocker are more particularly
appropriated to pheasant and woodcock
shooting. The former may be considered the
most laborious, and the least entertaining of
all field sports, if we except the mode in
which it is practised in the extensive preserves
of Norfolk and Suffolk, and some few districts
in other counties, where the large tracts
of lofty wood-lands with thick and low underwood,
contribute so materially to the safety
and increase of the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spaniels of both descriptions are brought
into general use and domestic estimation,
from their handsome shape, their beautiful
sleek coats, their cleanly habits, insinuating
manner, incessant attendance, and faithful
obedience to their masters, qualities in which
they surpass all the other members of the
canine race.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cockers are said to be more subject to
certain diseases than other dogs, as loss of
smell, and swelling of the glands in the neck,
which sometimes prevents their taking any
assistance till they die; a disease of the ears,
like the mange, called formicæ; and lastly to
the mange itself, which is most destructive of all
to their beauty, health, and quiet.—<i>Thornhill.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The fishermen take the cod from the
depth of fifteen to sixty fathoms, according
to the inequality of the bank, which is represented
as a mountain under water, above
five hundred miles long, and near three hundred
broad, and that the approach to it is
known by the great swell of the sea, and the
thick mists that impend over it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The largest cod ever taken on our coasts
was at Scarborough, in 1755, and weighed
seventy-eight pounds; the length was five
feet eight inches; and the girth, round the
shoulders, five feet. It was sold for one
shilling. The general weight of these fish in
the Yorkshire seas, is from fourteen to forty
pounds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A cod will not only live, but thrive well,
in fresh water, if properly fed. A respectable
fishmonger assured me that he had tried the
experiment and succeeded, and offered to
send me some live cod in a well-boat, for my
<i>piscatorium</i> in Bushy Park.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Coffin</span>, <i>s.</i> Coffin of a horse, is the whole hoof of the foot above the
coronet, including the coffin-bone.</p>

<p class='c006'>A sprain of the coffin joint is not an unusual
occurrence; and, like the former, consists
of violence applied to the tendinous and
ligamentous connexion of this joint. When
a horse becomes suddenly lame, and attentive
examination can discover no injury above, the
feet should be closely examined, when it is
very probable there will be found in one of
them some tenderness, and perhaps swelling,
particularly at the back part, towards the
upper portions of the heels, and in the neighbourhood
of the navicular bone, where the
part will be more hot than the others, and the
horse will express pain when the foot is bent
or extended, and he will generally also,
though not always, point the foot when in the
stable, or, as it is expressed, will stand favouring.
The treatment, if the heat be considerable,
would be to put the whole foot into a
Goulard poultice for three or four days: in
very bad cases I have thinned the whole crust
of the hoof, and have drawn blood from the
toe with advantage. After the heat has in
some degree subsided, blister, as a milder
treatment will seldom avail here: frequently
it must be repeated also.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Colic</span>, <i>s.</i> Is strictly a disorder of the colon; but loosely, any disorder of
the stomach or bowels that is attended with pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The causes are various: the sudden application
of cold either to the surface of the
skin when hot, or to the intestines under similar
circumstances, in the shape of cold
water drunk hastily, and when the horse has
been warm; in which latter case, the attack
often soon follows. Costiveness will bring it
on. Tumours in the mesentery, and strictures
in the bowels are also the sources of
occasional colic; and when a horse is found to
be subject to repeated attacks, something of
this kind, or otherwise calculous concretions,
may be suspected: and I have known many
instances where habitual colic was present,
dependent on these causes. Horses long confined
to dry food will sometime get it by suddenly
gorging themselves with green meat;
and with others, a constitutional tendency
from some occult cause, gives them a predisposition
to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of spasmodic colic are usually
sudden in their appearance, and not
marked, as in inflammation of the bowels, by
previous indisposition; but the horse is observed
to be at once attacked with considerable
uneasiness, shifting his position from side
to side, pawing his litter, and stamping with
his feet impatiently. After a few minutes
thus passed, the pain remits, and leaves the
horse tolerably easy; while in enteritis no
perfect remission occurs, but all is one scene
of nearly equable pain and distress. As the
colic advances, the remissions are less perfect,
and less frequent: the horse now lies down
frequently, and on rising shakes himself, looking
round to his sides, which occasionally, in
desperate cases, he snaps at with his teeth;
but more frequently he is seen to strike with
his hind feet at his belly, as though determined
to remove by force the cause of his
pain. In enteritis this acuteness of sensation
or violence of temper is seldom seen. When
on the ground, it is not uncommon for the
horse to roll on his back; sometimes he will
remain in this situation a few seconds, or he
will roll over; neither of which are usually
done in simple inflammation. In colic the
pulse is seldom much altered from its natural
state, unless the colic have existed some
time, when it occasionally presents marks of
general irritation, and is not only quickened,
but also somewhat hardened. If felt also
during the intensity of the paroxysms, it will
likewise be often found to be disturbed even in
the early stage, but this is momentary only,
and ceases on the remission of the pain. The
extremities, as the legs and ears, in colic are
not often much affected, and they never remain
intensely cold for a considerable period,
as in enteritis; but the coat stares, and the
horse breaks out frequently into cold sweats.
In colic, also, relief is obtained by friction
and motion, but both aggravate the distress in
enteritis. Sometimes he is seen to attempt to
stale without effect, at others he stales frequently,
with momentary relief.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Treatment.</i>—Having reason to believe that
the patient is labouring under simple spasm of
the intestines, unmixed with inflammatory
tendency, derived from idiopathic enteritis;
or symptomatic irritation from inversion, involution,
invagination, or intussusception of
the intestinal track; proceed at once to administer
such one or more of the numberless
antispasmodic remedies as custom and experience
have warranted the use of. Numerous
as these are, there is not one that has not its
advocate, and perhaps not one that does not
deserve it, so simple are the means sometimes
required; and so much is the constitution
prone, in some cases, to assist itself or our
efforts. While, at the same time, other cases
occur, sufficiently obstinate, and sufficiently
fatal, to require all our energies, and all our
discrimination in the choice of our remedies,
I can confidently speak to the antispasmodic
qualities of the following, which should one
or either of them be given as soon as possible,
and repeated in one, two, three, or four hours,
according to the violence of the symptoms, if
no benefit be apparent from the first dose: for
it must be remembered, that what we do we
must do quickly, to prevent inflammation, for,
of the fatal cases, four-fifths show evident
marks of enteritic attack on a post-mortem
examination.</p>

<p class='c006'>The antispasmodic having been given, the
necessity of bleeding should be next taken
into consideration: if the case be one of very
acute features, I would recommend that it be
proceeded with without delay, and, according
to the degree of intensity, or duration of the
complaint, do it more or less liberally. Extensive
bleeding, it should be remembered, is
one of the most powerful relaxers of spasmodic
constriction with which we are acquainted,
and instead of its being an antagonist
to the antispasmodic treatment usually
adopted, by internal remedies, its relaxant
qualities are found to be infinitely increased in
efficacy when conjoined with large doses of
opium. I have had so many opportunities of
witnessing the effect of this combination, that
I cannot too strongly recommend it: and
although most of the ordinary cases of spasmodic
colic will yield to the common stimulant
treatment, and many would even go off
without any treatment at all, yet bleeding, in
mild cases even, is always safe and precautionary
against inflammation; and in the more
aggravated, it is essentially necessary, both to
combat the inflammatory tendency, and to
promote the relaxation of the spasmodic irritation
on the muscular fibre. It is likewise
particularly indicated in these violent or protracted
cases, to counteract the irritative qualities
of the antispasmodics used, which, though
in other instances of simple spasm are innocuous,
however large, yet may not prove so
when reaction is at hand, or already begun.
It should, however, be remembered, that
though I advocate bleeding, it is not that useless
and non-medical practice of bleeding by
the palate or sublingual vessels; and though,
with Mr. Peal, I would most strongly condemn
violent, and particularly long-continued
exercise, yet I have so often experienced the
good effects of a brisk trot for ten minutes,
that I cannot but recommend its adoption.
Friction to the belly is also to be employed,
by means of a brush, or if with a heated coarse
woollen cloth it will be better; but the practice
of rubbing with a stick is, I apprehend,
worse than useless, and often hurtful. Fomentations
of very hot water are also sometimes
singularly efficacious; and in every case
we should, by means of the patent syringe,
throw up considerable quantities of relaxant
clysters; and where costiveness is present,
until the bowels are relieved of their fæcal
matter, the clysters should be of a mild
watery solution of aloes, or, by preference, of
a solution of sulphate of magnesia (Epsom
salts) in broth, gruel, &amp;c. Afterwards the
clysters may be made media of applying antispasmodics
to the bowels, as decoction of
poppy heads, or even tinct. opii, largely diluted
with warm water, &amp;c.—<i>Vide</i> <i>Outlines of

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Dogs are subject to two kinds of colic; one
arising from constipation of the bowels; the
other is of a kind peculiar to dogs, apparently
partaking of the nature of rheumatism, and
also of spasm. From a sudden or violent
exposure to cold, dogs become sometimes
suddenly paralytic, particularly in the hinder
parts, having great tenderness and pain, and
every appearance of lumbago. In every
instance of this kind, there is considerable
affection of the bowels, generally costiveness,
always great pain. A warm bath,
external stimulants, but more particularly
active aperients, remove the colic. Colic,
arising from costiveness, is not in general violently
acute from the pain it produces; sometimes
it appears accompanied with more spasm
than is immediately dependent on the confinement
of the bowels. In the former give
active aperients, as calomel with pil. cochiæ,
i. e. aloetic pill, and clysters; in the latter,
castor-oil, with laudanum and ether.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

bodies of artificial flies. Mixing the wools, or
producing, by a union of different colours, the
exact shade of the body of the insect to be
imitated, is justly reckoned the greatest difficulty
of the art; and I have known many
persons tie a fly with neatness and elegance,
who never could turn out a killing one.
Hence practical acquaintance with the ephemeræ,
which are imitated, is absolutely requisite
for tying, as without it, the handsomest
fly is inefficient.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this may be ascribed the inferiority of
the flies usually purchased in extensive fishing
shops. Though, possibly, an elegant similitude
of the intended insect in size and shape,
they are, in tint and colouring, untrue to nature;
and, as such, are easily discovered by
the keen eye of the invited victim, and as
certainly rejected. Without the precise colour
of the fly is obtained, the handsomest
production will be unsuccessful; and the
neophyte will marvel that the basket of the
rustic fisherman is filled, while his own showy
imitations fail to rise a fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>In choosing colours the brightness of the
tint is to be less regarded than the permanency
of the dye. To produce, at the same time, a
brilliant and lasting colour, requires time,
trouble, and experience. But for all the
disciple of Walton will be well repaid; for
nothing can be more mortifying to an angler,
than to see the tints of his fly fade after a few
immersions in the water, and a short exposure
to the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The receipts for dying wools and feathers,
recommended in the <span class='sc'>Field Book</span>, were given
the compiler by Major Patrickson, an angler,
who, in scientific and practical knowledge is,
probably, second to none in Britain. They
may, perhaps, be undervalued by modern
philosophers; but from these simple and antiquated
recipes, my accomplished friend produced
the most beautiful and permanent colours;
and I have, at this moment, in my
possession, flies bodied with his wools, which
have stood the test of water and weather, and
are still as brilliant in their hue, as when
they were first attached to the hook. <i>Vide</i>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Commerce</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of this game there are two distinct methods
of playing, the new and the old mode. The
new way is played by any number of persons,
from three to twelve, with a complete pack of
52 cards, bearing the same import as at whist,
only the ace is reckoned as eleven. Every
player has a certain quantity of counters, on
which a fixed value is put, and each, at every
fresh deal, puts down one for the stake. Sometimes
the game is continued, or not finished,
till one of the players has lost all the counters
given at the commencement; but in order to
prevent it from being spun out to an unpleasant
length, or concluded too soon, it is often
customary to fix the duration to a determinate
number of tours, or times, so that the whole
party shall deal once each completely round.</p>

<p class='c006'>After determining the deal, the dealer,
styled also the banker, shuffles the pack, which
is to be cut by the left-hand player; then three
cards, either altogether or one by one, at the
dealer’s pleasure, are given to each person,
beginning on the right hand, but none are to
be turned up. If the pack prove false, or the
deal wrong, or should there be a faced card,
there must be a fresh deal. There are three
degrees or ranks in this game. The first,
which takes place of all others, is what is called
the tricon, or three cards of the same denomination,
similar to pair royal at cribbage; the
next in rank is the sequence, or three following
cards of the same suit, like tierce at piquet;
and the last, the point, being the greatest number
of pips on two or three cards of a suit in
any one hand. As to all these parts, the
higher disannuls the lower. For the old

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Condition</span>, <i>s.</i> Quality, that by which any thing is denominated good or
bad; natural quality of the mind, temper, temperament.</p>

<p class='c006'>Condition, as regards horses, is a term conventionally
well understood; but beyond the
precincts of the stable, it is neither precise nor
technical. The term, in common parlance,
might be supposed to imply nothing more
than the symptoms and appearances which
usually betoken health. Thus, when a horse
is in perfect health, he ought, under this view
of it, to be considered as in perfect <i>condition</i>;
and, on the contrary, when a horse is in any
respect out of health, he should be considered
as out of <i>condition</i>; that is, in a <i>condition</i>
that neither fits him for perfect service to his
owner, nor for perfect comfort to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>The accidental causes of this latter (morbid
<i>condition</i>) are various; a very common one
is found in injudicious feeding, both as to
quality and quantity. Any sudden alteration
in the articles of a horse’s diet will frequently,
according to the term of horse amateurs,
“<i>throw him out of condition</i>,” such as
removing him from the grass field or the
straw yard to a full allowance of dry hay and
corn, with a scanty supply of water “<i>to draw
up his belly</i>;” all which are perhaps done at
once, without the smallest preparation. In
these cases the alimentary canal, being hardly
yet in a state of digesting capacity, suffers
from the increased powers necessary to draw
nutriment from substances which, although in
themselves more nutritious, yet are, in this
instance, less digestible than those before in
use. Thence follow costiveness, heat, and
thirst; as well as an unhealthy state of the
coat, which stares, and feels harsh and dry,
being a necessary consequence of the ordinary
sympathy between the stomach and the skin.
A sudden remove from a generous to a poor
diet is unfavourable to <i>condition</i> likewise;
for in such case the chyle or nutritious pabulum,
from whence all the vital organs are recruited,
and all the vital energies derive their
vigour, cannot be separated in sufficient quantities:
the blood thereby becomes deteriorated;
universal absorption takes place of the softer
parts, which produces lessened bulk; while a
laxity of fibre in the remaining portions is productive
of langour and debility. The quality
of the food is also of considerable consequence
to the <i>condition</i>. Mow-burnt hay, by exciting
a partial diabetes, is very apt to “<i>throw
a horse out of condition</i>.” Musty hay, also,
and oats highly kiln-dried, have an unfavourable
effect on it also. The liquid aliments
should likewise be attended to in a consideration
of the <i>condition</i>. Mineral waters are
unfavourable to it in most cases; although
there is reason to believe that in some morbid
affections they are salutary. Sea-water
may be considered in the same light, but a
continued use of the brackish water found
near sea-bathing places, is unfavourable to the
<i>condition</i> of such horses as have not been
accustomed to it: to which, in union with the
bad care taken of them in most of the livery
stables of the sea-coast bathing, I attribute
the universal complaint of the ill-condition in
which they so frequently return from thence.
Badly ventilated stables, excess of clothing,
and deprivation of water, are also frequent
causes of <i>morbid condition</i>, as I have often
witnessed: for, in some of these cases, after a
course of purgatives, followed by alteratives
and tonics, has failed, the more simple means
of succulent food, a proper quantity of water,
a well regulated but perfectly cool stable, with
a free access of air, and very moderate clothing,
have created an immediate change. An
inordinate quantity of exertion, particularly if
continued unremittingly for several days, will
often produce <i>morbid condition</i>; and this
in cases where the feeding has been, as supposed,
equal to the tasks required. It is particularly
likely to happen to young horses,
and to such as have not been sufficiently prepared:
in which cases, it is clear that the
stomach, participating with the general debility,
has a double task to perform in digesting
a larger quantity of nutriment than usual, to
make up the increased wants of the constitution;
and thus the evil is increased by adding
the further deterioration of this organ to the
others. I know of no state of morbid condition
which often proves so obstinate as this;
and which is often found at last only to give
way to a good salt-marsh run. Drastic purgatives,
or violent remedies, as the mineral
acids, when injudiciously continued, reduce
the <i>condition</i> very quickly, and sometimes
irrecoverably. Another principal cause of
want of condition is the alternation of heat
with cold. A sudden check to the natural
or acquired heat of the body, particularly if
aggravated by the evaporation of a perspiring
state, and great previous exertion, as a sudden
check after a severe burst with the hounds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>After a general enumeration of the causes
of morbid condition, Mr. Blaine continues:—But
to proceed with this important subject
with some regularity, I would direct that in
young plethoric horses, with much flesh on
them, and which are, of all others, the most
subject to take on this state of <i>morbid condition</i>,
that one or two moderate bleedings
may be premised, particularly in such as have
been full fed for some time previous. If the
inner surface of the eyelids, or of the nasal
membranes, show any tinges of red, it is still
more necessary to bleed; and in such cases I
would repeat the same with moderation once
or twice more, or until this inflammatory
appearance should be removed. I have found
this, united with mashing, in many instances
sufficient to relax the hide and reduce the
rugous tumefaction of the lampas. In most
cases, however, some more active internal
remedies will be found necessary with a young
and plethoric patient: thus one or two very
mild doses of physic, preceded by a nightly
mash, into which ten grains of submuriate of
mercury (calomel) has been mixed, are proper.
If there be joined to the affected hide,
and the swollen or clammy mouth of lampas,
any eruptions on the skin, or any cracks of
the heels, stable soiling, or even daily turning
out to grass, are advisable; but as these
cases usually happen when the animal is
either at present wanted, or is intended soon
to be used, so I have not mentioned <i>turning
out</i> altogether; yet, if these appearances
prove obstinate, such a course will be advisable,
provided the season and other circumstances
are favourable to the proceeding.
But when neither the partial nor total turning
out to grass is convenient, and when soiling is
likewise not practicable, still the use of carrots
as manger food can be resorted to. To
this treatment may be added, after the administration
of the physic, a nightly alterative.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both of these will gently stimulate both the
stomach and kidneys, and produce, by consent
of parts, a favourable effect on the skin, and
hair also. Violent diuretics are never advisable;
nor have I seen their mildest form,
unaccompanied by other remedies, produce
much good, unless there have been, in addition
to the other symptoms, swelled legs,
either with or without discharge.</p>

<p class='c006'>When <i>morbid condition</i> arises in such horses
as, from age, previous deprivations, severe
work, long confinement in bad stables, or
feeding on unwholesome provender, are not
to be supposed plethoric; even then, if no
actual debility is present, I have often derived
great benefit by commencing the treatment
with a very mild dose of physic, the horse
being previously fully mashed, to make a
small quantity of aloes sufficient; for I have
generally found that the stomach tonics to
be afterwards administered have had double
effect from this previous preparation of the
alimentary canal. But where the debility
has been extreme, or where there has been
already sufficient laxity of bowels, or perhaps
even superpurgation from drastic physic, begin
at once with either of the following tonics, or

<p class='c006'>Either of these formulæ may be given some
time in each day, at the convenience of
the practitioner or owner. It would, however,
where practicable, be more prudent to
let it be given in the morning, fasting, allowing
the horse but a handful or two of hay for
an hour after its exhibition. If a liquid form
only can be got down, either of the above
mixtures may be dissolved and horned down
as a drink, with ale; but active mineral
agents seem to produce their effect best in
mass. In all cases of <i>morbid condition</i>,
marked with emaciation and debility, a full
allowance of carrots is advisable; and in default
of them, or alternating with them, malt
mashes or speared corn may be usefully
brought in aid of the other tonics.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When a horse returns from grass, or straw-yard,
both his external appearance, and the
internal state of his body, in general, require
considerable <i>alteration</i> before he can be said to
be fit for the uses to which he is applied by man.</p>

<p class='c006'>To promote ‘<i>condition</i>’ in a horse from
grass, his dieting and watering, the temperature
to which he is removed, his clothing,
grooming, and exercise, are the circumstances
particularly to be attended to. Physicking
is also a usual and necessary appendage to the
other parts of the treatment.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be most imprudent to take a horse
from so moist a food as grass, and at once to
place before him hay and corn without caution
or limitation. Coming from a straw-yard, this
restraint is not so imperative; yet even in this
case, little corn should be given at first: but
following the removal from grass, both corn
and hay should be allowed but sparingly, particularly
the former. The hay given for the
first two or three days should likewise be moistened,
by sprinkling it with water; the corn
allowed should also be mixed with bran, by
which the dangers of constipation and repletion
may be avoided. The constipating effects of
the removal from a moist to a dry course of
feeding, may be further obviated by a nightly
bran mash. The bran mashing may likewise
be extended to twice a day, or until the bowels
be somewhat relaxed, if the horse be very
full in flesh, or have his skin at all tight, or
eruptive; or if the legs be inclined to swell.
In all which cases it likewise tends to shorten
the process, and prevent that almost irrecoverable
hide-binding, which often follows these
appearances, if succulent food, particularly carrots,
be mixed with, or even wholly substituted
for, hay. The privation of grass renders
it prudent that water should at first be given
in sufficient quantity: it is often withheld,
with a view to harden the flesh and get up the
belly: but this treatment at first is erroneous,
and by exciting heat, thirst, and indigestion,
frustrates its own intention. The <i>temperature</i>
into which the newly-stabled horse is
removed, should not at first be much increased
beyond that to which he has been so long accustomed,
or the sudden change may operate
unfavourably on his lungs; and if it does not
produce inflammation, it may at least occasion
roaring, or broken wind. The most prudent
plan is, first to place the horse in an airy box,
which will not only prevent too great heat,
but also obviate the danger of swelled legs, and
heated feet. By degrees so much increase of
temperature may be kept up, as will promote
the fall of long hair, or the retention or renewal
of the short: and in the degree to which
the artificial coating is wished to be carried, to
that degree should a temperate or an ardent
climate be imitated. The <i>clothing</i> and grooming
should, like the other parts of the conditioning
treatment, be at first very moderate:
the one produces extra heat, the other extra
irritation; but by degrees both may be increased
according to the views of the owner, or
the purposes of the horse. <i>Physicking</i> is
found to assist the <i>condition</i> of horses; for by
emptying the bowels thoroughly, absorption
of the extraneous fluids is promoted. One,
two, or three doses, according to the extent to
which the condition is intended to be carried,
are usually given to every horse, where this
process is conducted on the usual principles;
and are certainly necessary, wherever continued
and accelerated exertions are required.
<i>Exercising</i> a conditioning horse, like the
other aids, must be done with a due regard to
circumstances. At first, walking alone best
answers the purpose, and twice a-day is better
than once: the duration of each walk must be
regulated by the age, the fulness of habit, &amp;c.
&amp;c. As the condition improves, trotting and
galloping may be employed, to benefit the wind,
draw up the carcass, and accustom the horse
to full work. It may be here remarked, that
I have seen all attempts to promote condition
fail in a horse removed from an old companion,
or when stabled alone. Horses are gregarious,
and often bear segregation badly: such a case
can only be treated by association.—<i>Blaine</i>—<i>Outlines

frequently be “worth a Jew’s eye;” but
every thing beyond this in kitchen accomplishments,

I recommend the neophyte to make
himself in every thing as independent as he
can. A few practical lessons are worth a
world of precept: one week’s cooking in the

<p class='c006'>Its characteristics are, bill strong, thick,
sloping to a point; the base of the upper
mandible rising far up into the forehead;
both mandibles of equal length; nostrils
inclining to oval, narrow, short; body compressed;
wings and tail short; toes long,
furnished with broad scalloped membranes
between each joint, on each side; the inner
toe has two, the middle three, and the outer
four scallops; and the hinder toe, one plain
membrane adhering to its whole length.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Bald Coot.</i>—(<i>Fulica atra</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>—<i>Le
Foulque au Morelle</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird
generally weighs, when in full condition,
about twenty-eight ounces, and measures fifteen
inches in length. The bill is of a greenish
white colour, more than an inch and a
quarter long: a callous white membrane, like
that of the water hen, but larger, is spread
over the forehead, which also, as in that bird,
changes its colour to a pale red in the breeding
season: irides red; the upper part of the
plumage is black, except the outer edges of
the wings, and a spot under each eye, which
are white; the under parts are of a hoary
dark ash or lead colour. The skin is clothed
with a thick down, and covered with close
fine feathers; the thighs are placed far behind,
are fleshy and strong, bare, and yellow
above the knees; the legs and toes are commonly
of a yellowish green, but sometimes of
lead colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common coot has so many traits in its
character, and so many features in its general
appearance like the rails and water hens, that
to place it after them, seems a natural and
easy gradation. Linnæus and other ornithologists,
however, describe it as a genus distinct
from those birds, and from the waders in
general, on account of its being fin footed,
and its constant attachment to the waters,
which, indeed, it seldom quits. With it naturalists
begin the numerous tribe of swimmers,
and rank it among those that are the most
completely dependent upon the watery element
for their support: it swims and dives
with as much ease as almost any of them;
and also, like those which seldom venture
upon land, it is a bad traveller, and may be
said not to walk, but to splash and waddle
between one pool and another, with a laboured,
ill balanced, and awkward gait.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds skulk and hide themselves during
the day among rushes, sedges, and weeds,
which grow abundantly in the loughs and
ponds, where they take up their constant abode:
they rarely venture abroad, except in the
dusk, and in the night, in quest of their food,
which consists of the herbage, seeds, insects,
and the slippery inhabitants of stagnant waters.
It is seldom that the sportsman and his dog
can force the coot to spring from its retreat;
for it will, in a manner, bury itself in the
mud rather than take wing: and when it is
very closely pursued, and compelled to rise,
it does so with much fluttering and apparent
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is met with in Great Britain
at all seasons of the year; and it is generally
believed that it does not migrate to other
countries, but changes its stations, and removes
in the autumn from the lesser pools or
loughs, where the young have been reared, to
the larger lakes, where flocks assemble in the
winter. The female commonly builds her
nest in a bush of rushes surrounded by the
water; it is composed of a great quantity of
coarse dried weeds, well matted together, and
lined within with softer and finer grasses: she
lays from twelve to fifteen eggs at a time, and
commonly hatches twice in a season: her eggs
are about the size of those of a pullet, and
are of a pale brownish white colour, sprinkled
with numerous small dark spots, which, at the
thicker end, seem as if they had run into
each other, and formed bigger blotches.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as the young quit the shell, they
plunge into the water, dive, and swim about
with the greatest ease; but they still gather
together about the mother, and take shelter
under her wings, and do not entirely leave her
for some time. They are at first covered with
sooty coloured down, and are of a shapeless
appearance: while they are in this state, and
before they have learned, by experience, to
shun their foes, the kite, moor buzzard, and
others of the hawk tribe, make dreadful
havoc among them; and this, notwithstanding
the numerous brood, may account for the
scarcity of the species.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Greater Coot.</i>—(<i>Fulica aterrima</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Grand Foulque au Morelle</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This
is of a larger size than the last,
but differs not in the colour of the plumage,
except that it is blacker. Brisson distinguishes
the two by the colour of the bare forehead,
which is in this white; and the garters, which
are of deep red. This bird is said to be found
in Lancashire and in Scotland. It should
seem to be a mere variety of the former, did
not authors join in advancing the contrary.
They are more plentiful on the continent,
being found in Russia and the western part of
Siberia very commonly, and are also in plenty
at Sologne and the neighbouring parts, where
they call it judelle. The people eat them on
maigre days, and the flesh is much esteemed.—<i>Latham.</i></p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A curious anecdote is related of a bald
coot that built her nest in Sir William Middleton’s
lake, at Belsay, Northumberland.
The rushes which contained it being afterwards
loosened by the wind, the nest was
driven about, and floated upon the surface of
the water, in every direction; notwithstanding
which, the female continued to sit as
usual, and brought out her young upon her
moveable habitation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cleaning Coots.</i>—The recipe for this, is,
after picking them, to take off all the black
down, by means of powdered white rosin and
boiling water, and then to let them soak all
night in cold spring water; by which they are
made to look as delicate as a chicken, and to
eat tolerably well; but, without this process,
the skin, in roasting, produces a sort of oil,
with a fishy taste and smell; and, if taken
off, the bird becomes dry, and good for nothing.
After all, however, these birds are in
no way delicate, except when skinned; and
after being soaked twenty-four hours in cold
spring water, repeatedly changed, made into a
pudding, by which, as with all such birds,
when in puddings, pies, or soup, you can get
rid of their strong skins without losing the
juice of their flesh; and their fishy taste is,
in a great measure, drawn off by steam.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moor-hens may be cleaned in like manner,
and, if in good condition, they will then be
nearly equal to any wild fowl.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

that, whenever a cordial appears necessary, we
should give one of no greater strength than
is sufficient to produce the desired effect;
and it will be found, I think, that a much
better effect may be produced by three or
four small doses, or weak cordials, than by
giving only one large dose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this species varies from four
to seven pounds, and the size from thirty-two
inches to three feet four or five in length,
and from four feet to four feet six inches in
breadth. The bill, to the corners of the
mouth, measures four inches, and on its ridge
two and three quarters; it is of a dark horn
colour, and the tip or nail of the upper bill is
much hooked and sharp; from the base of
this it is furrowed on each side nearly to the
tip, without any visible appearance of nostrils;
the lower bill is compressed, and covered,
about the gape of the mouth, with a naked
yellowish skin, extended under the chin and
throat, where it hangs loose, and forms a kind
of pouch, which, together with the springing
blade on each side, forming its rim, is capable
of distension to a great width, and enables the
bird to swallow prey apparently too large to
be admitted into its throat; the skin about
the eyes is also naked, and of the same colour
as the pouch; the eyes, which have a remarkable
wild stare, and are placed near the bill,
look like two little greenish glass globes.
The crown of the head, and the neck, are
black; on the hinder part of the former the
feathers appear elongated, and form a sort of
loose short crest. In some specimens the
throat is white, with a kind of stripe passing
from it, upwards, behind each eye; in others
the cheeks and throat are mixed with brown
and white; and again, in others the head and
neck are streaked with scratches of the latter
colour. The middle of the belly is white,
with a patch of the same colour over each
thigh; all the under parts, however, together
with the back and rump, are commonly of a
glossy blue black, with green reflections: the
shoulders, scapulars, and wing-coverts, are of
a bronze brown, tinged and glossed with
green, and each feather is bordered with
shining blueish black; the secondary quills
are nearly of the same colour; the coverts
and the primaries are dusky. The tail consists
of fourteen stiff husky feathers, which
look as if they were discoloured by being
dipped in mud or dirty kennel-water: the
legs are thick, strong, black, and coarse, about
two inches and a half long, and the outer toe
is more than four in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cormorant is found in every climate.
In Greenland, where it is said they remain
throughout the year, the jugular pouch is
made use of by the natives, as a bladder to
float their fishing-darts, after they are thrown;
their skins, which are tough, are used for
garments, and their flesh for food; “but the
eggs are too fetid to be eaten even by the
Greenlanders.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>These birds usually assemble in flocks on
the summits and inaccessible parts of the
rocks which overhang or are surrounded by
the sea, upon which the female makes her
nest of the withered sea-tang, weeds, sticks,
and grasses, which are cast on shore by the
waves: she lays four or more greenish-white
eggs, of the size of those of a goose, but of a
longer shape. There are writers who assert
that, in some parts of the world, they build
their nests on trees, like the rook and the
heron; other authors, stricken with the singular
conformation of the feet and serrated
claws, have ascribed properties to them which
they do not possess, and believe that they
hold their prey in one foot, while with the
other they push forward to the shore, or carry
it thither, in the same manner, on the wing;
but this seems mere conjecture, for the feet
of this tribe are not fitted for any such purpose;
they are, like those of all the expert
divers, placed far behind; and while, by the
position of these, and the powerful strokes
from their broad webs, the bird is enabled to
pursue and overtake its slippery prey, the
hooked, sharp-edged beak is the only fit instrument
both to catch and to secure it; and
there is no need to use the awkward expedient
of removing it afterwards to the foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>At sea, or on the inland lakes, they make
terrible havoc. From the greatest height
they drop down upon the object of pursuit,
dive after it with the rapidity of a dart,
and, with an almost unerring certainty, seize
the victim; then emerging with the fish
across the bill, with a kind of twirl, throw it
up into the air, and, dexterously catching it
head foremost, swallow it whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>While at rest on the shore, commonly on
the ledge of a projecting rock, these birds sit,
more or less, in an erect posture, and are
propped up by the stiff feathers of the tail;
and in places where they have not experienced
the fatal effects of the gun, they have
been known, however wary at other times, to
sit and receive repeated shots, without offering
to move out of the danger. At other
times and places, while they sit in a dosing
and stupified state, from the effects of one of
their customary surfeits, they may easily be
taken, by throwing nets over them, or by
putting a noose around their necks, which
they avoid no further than by slipping the
head from side to side as long as they can.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the natural wildness of
their disposition, it seems, according to some
accounts, that certain species of these birds
have formerly been tamed and rendered subservient
to the purposes of man, both in this
and other countries. Among the Chinese it
is said they have frequently been trained to
fish, and that some fishermen keep many of
them for that purpose, by which they gain a
livelihood. “A ring placed round the neck
hinders the bird from swallowing; its natural
appetite joins with the will of its master, and
it instantly dives at the word of command;
when, unable to gorge down the fish it has
taken, it returns to the keeper, who secures it
to himself. Sometimes, if the fish be too big
for one to manage, two will act in concert,
one taking it by the head and the other by
the tail.” In England, according to Willoughby,
“when they came to the rivers,
they take off their hoods, and having tied a
leather thong round the lower part of their
necks, that they may not swallow down the
fish they catch, they throw them into the
river. They presently dive under water, and
there for a time, with wonderful swiftness,
they pursue the fish; and when they have
caught them, they arise presently to the top
of the water, and pressing the fish lightly with
their bills, they swallow them, till each bird
hath in this manner swallowed five or six
fishes; then their keepers call them to the
fist, to which they readily fly, and, little by
little, one after another, vomit up all their
fish, a little bruised with the nip they gave
them with their bills. When they have done
fishing, setting the birds on some high place,
they loose the string from their necks, leaving
the passage to the stomach free and open, and
for their reward they throw them part of the
prey they have caught, to each, perchance, one
or two fishes, which they by the way, as they
are falling in the air, will catch most dexterously
in their mouths.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Whitelock tells us “That he had a cast of
them manned like hawks, which would come
to hand.” He took much pleasure in them,
and relates, that the best he had was one presented
to him by Mr. Wood, Master of the
Cormorants to Charles the First.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Heysham relates that, about the year
1759, one of these birds “perched upon the
castle at Carlisle, and soon afterwards removed
to the cathedral, where it was shot at
upwards of twenty times without effect; at
length a person got upon the cathedral, fired
at, and killed it.” “In another instance, a
flock of fifteen or twenty perched, at the
dusk of evening, in a tree on the banks of the
river Esk, near Netherby, the seat of Sir
James Graham. A person who saw them
settle, fired at random at them in the dark six
or seven times, without either killing any or
frightening them away: surprised at this, he
came again, at day-light, and killed one,
whereupon the rest took flight.”—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Latham</i>—<i>Willoughby,

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Corn</span>, <i>s.</i> The seeds which grow in ears, not in pods; grain unreaped;

<p class='c006'><i>Corns</i> are a very common and a very troublesome
disorder, and may truly be said to be
often occasioned by the smith, being generally
in consequence of bad shoeing. Corns most
commonly happen in white feet with weak
low heels; but they are too common in feet
of all colours. They are occasioned by the
pressure of the heel of the shoe, either by its
bearing directly on the sole when it is too
thin to bear the pressure, or by its forcing the
heel of the crust inwards. In this way the
sensible sole and laminæ are bruised, their
blood-vessels ruptured, and the blood penetrates
into the pores of the horn, causing the
dark red appearance observable on removing
the shoe, and scraping off the surface of the
sole. This bruised part is exceedingly tender,
and incapable of bearing the pressure of
the shoe, and so are the crust and bar on each
side of it. In the treatment of this complaint
all this must be cut away, that is, all the
parts must be so cut down, crust, bar, and
sole, that when a bar shoe is applied it may
be full half an inch distant from its surface.
In this way a horse will be able to do his
work, provided the shoe is removed, and the
heel pared down as often as is necessary. As
in this case the frog will be constantly receiving
considerable pressure from the bar shoe,
it is necessary to take care that the heels are
not too thick and inflexible, in which case it
is necessary to rasp them; and whenever
there is a morbid degree of heat in the feet,
or dryness, they should be kept constantly
moist and cool in the stable, either by poultice
or by several folds of old woollen wrapped
round the coronet, and kept constantly wet.
The common practice of pairing <i>out</i> the corn
and leaving the bar and crust to be in contact
with the heel of the shoe, is doing no good,
nor would it afford even temporary relief, if
the shoe were not bent up or made to bear
off that quarter a little, as they term it; yet
after riding a few miles the shoe is sure to
yield to the horse’s weight, and bear upon the
tender heel. It is thus that corns are made
so troublesome as we find them, and many
horses are rendered nearly unserviceable, or
absolutely ruined by this improper treatment.
Matter is often formed within the heel from
this sort of management, and breaks out at
the coronet, frequently doing great mischief,
and even rendering the horse useless. When
corns have been suffered to go this length the
foot must be poulticed, and all the hollow
horn cut away. After the inflammation has
been thus completely subdued, the sensible
parts which have been laid bare may be
dressed with Friars’ balsam and the tar ointment.
The radical cure of corns is always
practicable if taken early, but in old cases the
sensible parts will always remain in a tender
state, however carefully they may be treated,
and will always require the defence of the
bar shoe, applied as I have described. A run
at grass <i>without shoes</i> is a great relief to a
horse with corns, provided the tender heel is
cut down as I have described, and the heel
and quarter rasped very thin. When a radical
cure is attempted, this is the most likely
means of effecting it.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cover</span>, <i>s.</i> Any thing that is laid over another; a concealment, a screen;
shelter; a wood, a thicket or place planted with furze or brushwood; a
breeding place for foxes. To <i>draw</i> a cover—to search it for foxes, by
sending the hounds through.</p>

<p class='c006'>Judicious huntsmen will observe where
foxes like best to lie; this must, of course,
vary in different countries, and a knowledge
of the country will best direct them in this
respect. Where there are large tracts of
cover, such observation will save time in finding;
generally speaking, foxes prefer covers
that lie high, are dry and thick at the bottom,
that are out of the wind, and are on the
sunny side of hills. The cover where a fox
is found, when it has remained still any time,
will probably produce a second. In nutting
time, furze-brakes and two or three years’
coppices are the only quiet places for a fox to
kennel in; when pheasant-shooting begins,
older covers are more likely. The season
when foxes are most wild and strong, is near
Christmas; a huntsman must, at that season,
lose no time in drawing, and be as silent as
possible; three or four years’ coppices, with
heath or furze at the bottom, are then most
likely. The male foxes, about Christmas,
travel miles after the females, and, when
hunted, generally run directly for the country
from whence they came; the compiler has at
that season, in the course of three weeks,
killed two brace of dog-foxes from one cover,
where the least distance was twelve, and in
one of the four chases was extended to double
the number of miles, from the place of unkennelling,
to the spot where the fox was killed.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a string of small covers have plenty
of foxes in them, some caution is necessary
to prevent their being all disturbed in one
day. Foxes are said to go down wind to
their kennel, but, however that may be, the
huntsman should begin drawing at the farthest
cover down the wind, and proceed from cover
to cover up the wind, till he finds; these advantages
will attend it; he will draw the covers
more speedily, there will be less difficulty in
getting hounds away, and as the fox most
likely will run to the covers already drawn,
there is the less probability of changing, and
the covers which are up the wind, beyond
where the fox is found, remain perfectly undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never hunt the small, until the large covers
have been well rattled; for it would be bad
policy to drive from the former to the latter
to increase the number. If foxes are meant
to be thinned and dispersed, hounds must
throw off at the same cover, as long as a fox
can be found. Hounds that come away with
the first fox that breaks, do not disturb the
cover, and may expect to find there again the
next day; but where foxes are scarce, the
same cover should never be drawn two days
following.</p>

<p class='c006'>Furze covers cannot be drawn too close, and
if a fox is there found, he should never be
hallooed until quite clear of them; from such
places, hounds are sure to go off well with him;
and it would be the height of cruelty to head
him back into the hounds’ mouths.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Much depends on the first finding a fox,
who, if well found, may be said to be half
killed. The huntsman should draw quietly,
and up the wind; this is material; the fox, by
drawing up the wind, does not hear the approach
of the hounds, who by this means are
also within hearing; besides, should the fox
turn down the wind, as most probably he will,
it lets the hounds all in. If covers are small,
and from which a fox cannot break unseen,
noise can then do no hurt, but late in the season
foxes are wild, particularly in covers that
are often hunted; and should there be any
noise, they will slink their kennels and get too
much advantage; the whipper-in, where this
is suspected to happen, should get the opposite
side of the cover, before the hounds are thrown
into it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When foxes are numerous, there is no occasion
for an early hour, and when they are
weak, by hunting late, they give better chases;
when foxes are strong, hounds ought then to
have the advantage which hunting early affords
them. When hounds go out late, they
should immediately proceed where it is likely
to find, which, for the most part, is that cover
where hounds have been least in; if a fox is
not soon found, a long and tiresome day is
generally the consequence; when the cover is
thick, particularly if it be furzy, it should be
drawn slowly; a fox at a late hour will keep
his kennel until hounds come close upon him.—<i>Beckford.</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Chronic Cough.</i>—It may appear strange
to a person unacquainted with the animal
economy, that what is taken into the stomach
should affect the mucous membrane of the
lungs, and that of the larynx, which is the
seat of chronic cough. It is in the following
manner: when the stomach is distended by
hay, and especially if that hay is bad, it is
gradually weakened, and rendered incapable
of performing its office properly; hence the
chyle is crude, and unfit for the purpose it
was intended for, that is, forming pure blood.
By this imprudent method of feeding them,
the blood is rendered impure, and of course
all the secretions become so likewise. Thus
it is that the bland mucous fluid, formed
upon the internal membrane of the wind-pipe
and its branches, for the purpose of defending
and lubricating it, becomes saline and
acrimonious, and a source of constant irritation:
hence arises the cough. It is commonly
observed, that horses with chronic cough have
immoderate appetites both for hay and water;
and though people have suspected some connexion
between this circumstance and the
cough, they have not perceived the entire
dependence of the cough upon it, which they
might easily have done by a very simple experiment.
Let a horse affected with chronic
cough be fed moderately upon green food
only, and it will generally be found that the
chronic cough will gradually go off. But let
the horse return to his former method of
feeding, and the disease will quickly reappear.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no occasion to say much on the
treatment and prevention of this disorder,
when arising from improper feeding. It may
be useful, however, to observe, that when the
appetite has been depraved, and the digestive
power weakened by long continued improper
feeding, they cannot be suddenly restored:
and it will often require a steady perseverance
in a careful system of feeding, and the use of
diuretic medicine, in such a way, however, as
to keep up only a moderate degree of increased
action in the kidneys, without injuring
those organs, or affecting the stomach: and
this may be accomplished by giving half an
ounce of nitre in a little corn twice or three
times a day, or the powder described afterwards.
If a horse is inclined to eat his litter,
he should be muzzled during the night, and
in the day time it should be taken from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chronic cough is sometimes a consequence
of a violent attack of catarrh or strangles,
especially when there has been considerable
soreness and inflammation of the throat, extending,
in some degree, perhaps, to the
larynx. Roaring often originates in the same
cause. I have known an obstinate chronic
cough cured by drenches composed of oxymel,
or a syrup made with treacle and vinegar;
also by a decoction of garlic with linseed oil.
Barbadoes tar and oil, with balsam of sulphur,
have also been employed as remedies
for cough. It is not improbable that these
drenches, by stimulating the throat, may
improve the secretion of the mucous membrane
of the larynx, or render it less irritable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Blistering the throat externally may also
be of use. In the human subject, gargles,
made of infusion of Cayenne pepper, have
been employed in hoarseness, and a syrup
made from a decoction of horse-radish; with
a view, probably, of improving the mucous
secretion of the larynx. Opium will frequently
put a stop to chronic cough for a day
or two; but its effect, I believe, is never
permanent. This seems to prove, however,
that the cough depends, in some measure, on
a morbid sensibility of the larynx.</p>

that the cough-ball has been more efficacious
when preceded by a mild purgative with a

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Coulterneb</span>, (<i>Fratercula arctica</i>, <span class='sc'>Briss.</span>) <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this species is between twelve
and thirteen ounces; length exceeds twelve
inches. The bill is of a very singular form;
it is about an inch and a half deep at the base,
much compressed sideways, and arched, but
ends in a point, where the upper mandible is a
little hooked: at the base of this mandible is
an elevated rim, full of small punctures of a
light colour; next to which is a space of blueish
grey, at the bottom of which the nostrils
are lodged at the edge, which is a long narrow
slit; from thence it is orange-coloured with
four oblique furrows; the under mandible corresponds
in colour, but has only three furrows;
irides hazel, in some greyish; orbits, red;
above the eye is a triangular callous protuberance,
beneath an oblong one; the top of the
head and whole upper parts are black, passing
round the neck in a collar; the sides of the
head and all the under parts are pure white;
the chin in some is grey, in others white, and
the cheeks are grey; quills dusky; tail short,
and consists of sixteen feathers; legs and feet
orange; claws black, the inner one much
hooked.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is remarked that the bill of this bird varies
much according to age; at first it has no
furrows, and is of a dusky-colour, the yellow
colour and furrows increasing with age.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds appear on many parts of our
rocky coasts about the middle of April, and
begin to breed about the middle of May. On
the stupendous cliffs of Dover, and such places,
they deposit their single eggs, in the holes and
crevices; in other places they burrow like rabbits,
if the soil is light; but more frequently
take possession of rabbit-burrows, and lay
their egg many feet under ground. This is
the case on Priestholm Isle off the coast of
Anglesea, and other small islands off St.
David’s-head, where the soil is sandy.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the coulterneb is, however, a robber of
rabbit-burrows, it is too formidably armed to
allow of retaliation with impunity, and few
birds or beasts dare venture to attack it in its
retreat. Sometimes, however, as Jacobson
tells us, “the raven makes bold to offer battle;
but as soon as he approaches, the coulterneb
catches him under the throat with her beak,
and sticks her claws into his breast till he
screams out with pain and tries to get away;
but the coulterneb keeps fast hold of him and
tumbles him about till both frequently fall
into the sea, where the raven is drowned, and
the coulterneb returns in triumph to her nest.
But should the raven, at the first onset, get
hold of the coulterneb’s neck, he generally
comes off victorious, kills the mother, and
feasts on her eggs or her young.” On St.
Margaret’s Island, near St. David’s, we have
seen the fishermen draw them out of their
holes in a singular manner; by introducing the
hand into the hole, which is seized by the bird,
who suffers himself to be drawn out rather than
loose his hold. In other places they are
caught by ferrets, and the young are pickled.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the latter end of August they retire
from our coast, and have all completely migrated
by the beginning of September, together
with the razor-bills and guillemots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The egg is white, but is occasionally found
obscurely speckled with cinereous, about the
size of a hen’s; their principal food is small
fish, particularly sprats, with which they feed
their young. It is not known to what parts
they retire when they leave our coast, but
they have been found in abundance in various
parts of the southern and northern hemisphere.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

soho’s before he put her from her form, to
give notice to the dogs that they may attend
her starting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hare was to have twelve score yards
law before the dogs were loosed, unless the
small distance from the cover would not admit
it without danger of immediately losing her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dog that gave the first turn, and during
the course, if there was neither cote, slip, nor
wrench, won.</p>

<p class='c006'>A cote is when the greyhound goes endways
by his fellow, and gives the hare a turn.</p>

<p class='c006'>A cote served for two terms, and two trippings
or jerkins for a cote; if the hare did not
turn quite about, she only wrenched, and two
wrenches stand for a turn.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there were no cotes given between a brace
of greyhounds, but that one of them served
the other at turning, then he that gave the
hare most turns won; and if one gave as many
turns as the other, then he that bore the hare,
won.</p>

<p class='c006'>A go-by or bearing the hare was equivalent
to two turns.</p>

<p class='c006'>If neither dog turns the hare, he that led
last to the cover won.</p>

<p class='c006'>If one dog turned the hare, served himself
and turned her again, it was as much as a cote,
for a cote was esteemed two turns.</p>

<p class='c006'>If all the course were equal, the dog that
bore the hare, won; if the hare was not borne,
the cause was adjudged dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a dog fell in a course, and yet performed
his part, he might challenge the advantage of
a turn more than he gave.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a dog turned the hare, served himself,
and gave divers cotes, and yet in the end stood
still in the field, the other dog, if he ran home
to the cover, although he gave no turn, was
adjudged the winner.</p>

<p class='c006'>If by accident a dog was rode over in his
course, the course was void, and he that did
the mischief was to make reparation for the
damage.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a dog gave the first and last turn, and
there was no other advantage betwixt them,
he that gave the odd turn won.</p>

<p class='c006'>He that came first at the death, took up the
hare, saved her from being torn, cherished the
dogs, and cleansed their mouths from the wool,
was adjudged to have the hare for his trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those that were judges of the course, were

<p class='c006'><i>Cracks or Ulcers in the Heels</i> are very
painful, often cause lameness, and, from improper

An emollient poultice should be first applied,
and continued for a few days, or until
the inflammation has completely subsided.
The crack, or ulcer, as well as all the hollow
part of the pastern or heel, should be covered
with the following paste, which is to remain
two or three days, and then washed off and
repeated. When the crack is perfectly healed
or dried up by this astringent paste, a little
salad oil or fresh hog’s lard is often necessary
to supple the part. In obstinate cases it is
necessary to keep the horse perfectly at rest
until the crack is healed, and sometimes to
apply the following ointment, spread on a
pledget of tow, and confined by a bandage:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Three of these dressings will generally cure
the disorder. During this treatment the
horse must not be taken out for exercise, but
be turned loose into a cool box or out-house,
where he may move himself about gently.
As he takes no exercise during this time, he
should be fed with bran mashes, and have
only very little hay, as his bowels would
otherwise be loaded with excrement, and much
mischief might thereby be done. Though
the disease is entirely local, it may not be
amiss to give half an ounce of nitre once or
twice a day in his mash.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses that are constantly kept trimmed
out in the heels, often lose the hair from the
part by the constant friction of the dirt in the
roads; and, besides the deformity this occasions,
they are still more liable to those painful
cracks. I have lately found the following
treatment successful. If the cracks are very
painful, poultice for one day and night, then
wash them three times a day with the following
lotion, for one or two days; after this
apply the astringent ointment, which generally
heals them in a short time:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Barley and wheat meal are generally the

for chickens and fowls; but in Sussex,
ground oats are used, and in that county, I
think, oats are in higher repute for fattening
than elsewhere, many large hogs being there
fattened with them. The food given them is
ground oats made into gruel, mixed with hogs’
grease, sugar, pot-liquor, and milk: or ground
oats, treacle, and suet, sheep’s plucks, &amp;c.
The fowls are kept very warm, and crammed
morning and night. The pot liquor is mixed
with a few handfuls of oatmeal and boiled,
with which the meal is kneaded into crams
or rolls of a proper size. The fowls are put
into the coop, two or three days before they
are crammed, which is continued for a fortnight,
and they are then sold to the higglers.
Those fowls, full grown, weigh seven pounds

there are instances of individuals double the

<p class='c006'>The Workingham method of feeding is to
confine the fowls in a dark place, and cram
them with a paste made of barley-meal, mutton
suet, treacle, or coarse sugar, and milk,

because it renders him very liable to indigestion
and flatulent colic. There is no doubt
that in crib-biting a horse swallows air, and I
have seen a horse distend his stomach and
bowels with it in an enormous degree, and he
would thereby often get the flatulent colic,
and sometimes swell himself that he could
scarcely move. The only convenient method
of preventing crib-biting is to put a leather
strap round the neck, close to the jaws, which
prevents him from laying hold of the manger;
it may impede his feeding, however, and this
must be attended to. A muzzle sometimes
answers the purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cribbage</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cribbage, a game differing from all others
by its immense variety of chances, and generally
reckoned useful to instruct young people
in the science of calculation, is played several
ways, either by two, three, or four persons,
with five, six, or sometimes eight cards: the
rules also vary a little in different companies;
but the following are those most generally
allowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dealer may discover his own cards,
though if he show any of the adversary’s, the
adversary is entitled to mark two points, and
is also at liberty to call a fresh deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should too many cards be dealt to either
party, the non-dealer may score two points,
and likewise demand another deal, upon the
error being detected previous to taking up the
cards; but if he should not choose a new deal,
the extra cards must be drawn: and when
any player is observed to have in hand more
than the proper number of cards, the opponent
may set up four points, and also call a
new deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>If any player meddle with the cards after
dealing, till the period of cutting them for the
turn-up card, his opponent may score two
points.</p>

<p class='c006'>When any player scores more than he is
entitled to, the other party may not only put
him back as many points as are overmarked,
but likewise score the same extra number for
his own game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should either party meddle even with his
own pegs unnecessarily, the opponent may
take two points, and if any one take out his
front peg, he must place the same back behind
the other; though when any are misplaced by
accident, a by-stander is to replace the same
according to the best of his judgment, but
never otherwise interfere.</p>

<p class='c006'>When any player miscalculates, or neglects
to set up what he is entitled to, the adversary
is, in some companies, allowed to take the
points so omitted; but in other companies
this rule is not observed, the inattentive player
being only prohibited from afterwards scoring
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each player may place his own cards,
when done with, on the pack.</p>

<p class='c006'>In five-card cribbage, the cards are to be
dealt one by one alternately; but when played
with six cards, it is customary to give three,
and if with eight cards, four at a time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The non-dealer, at the commencement of
the game, in five-card cribbage, scores three
points, called taking <i>three for last</i>; but in
six and eight-card cribbage this is not done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some parties permit flushes in play to be
reckoned, when three or more cards of a suit
are laid down successively; that is, the person
playing the third card reckons three, and
the player laying down a fourth of the same
suit scores four, and so on if five, six, or more
can be played.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of all the English athletic games, none perhaps
presents so fine a scope for bringing into
full and constant play the qualities both of the
mind and body as that of cricket. A man
who is essentially stupid will not make a fine
cricketer; neither will he who is not essentially
active. He must be active in all his faculties—he
must be active in mind to prepare
for every advantage; and active in eye and
limb, to avail himself of those advantages.
He must be cool-tempered, and, in the best
sense of the term—<span class='sc'>Manly</span>, for he must be
able to endure fatigue, and to make light of
pain; since, like all athletic sports, cricket is
not unattended with danger, resulting from
inattention and inexperience. The accidents,
however, attendant upon the players at cricket
commonly arise from unwatchfulness, or slowness
of eye. A short-sighted person is as unfit
to become a cricketer, as one deaf would be
to discriminate the most delicate gradations
and varieties in tones; added to which, he
must be in constant jeopardy of serious injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>This noble game is thoroughly British. Its
derivation is probably from the Saxon “cɲẏce
a stick.” Strutt, however, in his “Sports and
Pastimes,” states that he can find no record
of the game under its present appellation “beyond
the commencement of the last century,
where it occurs in one of the songs published
by d’Urfey.” The first four lines of “Of a
noble race was Shenkin,” run thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Her was the prettiest fellow</div>
      <div class='line in1'>At foot-ball or at <i>cricket</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>At hunting chase, or nimble race,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How featly her could prick it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The same historian of our games doubts not
that cricket derived its origin from the ancient
game of club-ball, the patronymics of which
being compounded of Welsh and Danish
(<i>clwppa</i> and <i>bol</i>) do not warrant his conclusion,
the Saxon being an elder occupant of our
island. The circumstance, however, of there
being no illustration extant—no missal illuminated
with a group engaged in this king of
athletic games, as is the case with its plebeian
brother, the club-ball; also from its constitution
being of a more civil and complicated character,
we may rationally infer that it is the
offspring of a more polite, at all events of a
maturer age, than its fellow. The game of
club-ball appears to have been no other than
the present well-known bat-and-ball, which,
with similar laws and customs prescribed in the
playing at it, was doubtless anterior to trap-ball.
The trap, indeed, carries with it an air
of refinement in the “march of mechanism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They who are acquainted with some of the
remote and unfrequented villages of England,
where the primitive manners, customs, and
games of our ancestors survive in the perfection
of rude and unadulterated simplicity,
must have remarked the lads playing at a game
which is the same in its outline and principal
features as the consummate piece of perfection
that at this day is the glory of “Lord’s,” and
the pride of English athletæ;—I mean the one
in which a single stick is appointed for a wicket,
ditto for a bat, and the same repeated, of about
three inches in length, for a ball. If this be
not the original of the game of cricket, it is a
plebeian imitation of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The constitution of this pastime has undergone
considerable alterations and improvements
since it has become a favourite and fashionable
recreation. Even till as late as the year 1770,
for instance, the wicket had consisted of two
stumps, when a <i>third</i>, the centre one, was
added:—a decided improvement; seeing that
it multiplied the chances to the batter of being
bowled out, consequently increased the difficulty
of his position, and thereby exalted his
maintaining it for any length of time into the
greater merit: for, under the old system, if the
ball passed between the stumps, the batter
was not considered out; under the improved
system, such an event cannot happen; for the
three stumps are not pitched at so great a distance
from each other as to allow of the transit
of the ball without knocking off the bale,
which decides the fate and existence of the
bats-man. The bale too, which crowns the
stumps, formerly consisted of a single piece of
wood, and therefore required a considerable
concussion of the ball to remove it, without
which the batter cannot be declared out; it
is now divided in the centre, and consequently
a very slight agitation of either of the outside
stumps will displace the one half resting upon
it; and this is equally fatal to the batsman as
if the two were knocked off.</p>

<p class='c006'>The formation of the bat has also undergone
considerable change and improvement.
In an old code of “the Laws of Cricket, revised
at the Star and Garter, Pall-mall, on
February 25, 1774, by a committee of noblemen
and gentlemen,” the rules and directions
are prefaced by a wood-cut of the bat then in
use, by which it appears that it was curved, and
the face flat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The modern bat is not only perfectly upright,
but its face is convex, which again increases
the difficulty to the player; for, in
striking the ball, unless he meet it directly in
the centre of his bat, the chances are many,
that, from the convexity in the face of the bat,
the ball will fly off in a diagonal line, and
the player may be caught out. The mode of
holding the bat has changed with its alteration
of form; the chief injunction now being to a
young player to keep his bat as upright as
possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regular and full game of cricket is
composed of twenty-two players, eleven in
each party. Each party also selects an umpire,
to whom all disputes are referred; who
decide whether a player be out or not; and
from whose judgment there is no appeal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wickets are pitched opposite to each
other, upon the most level and advantageous
ground, and twenty-two yards asunder. They
must stand twenty-seven inches out of the
ground, and the bales must be eight inches in
length. In a line with the wickets, a mark
is cut in the turf, three feet in length, which
is termed the bowling crease; and at right
angles with this is a short line, called the return
crease. The bowler, in delivering his
ball, is compelled to have one foot before, and
the other behind this crease; and if he fail, it
is the duty of the umpire at his wicket to call
out—“No ball!” in which case, the batter
may strike it, and obtain what advantage he
can, and if he be bowled out, it is not reckoned.
A good bowler is a most valuable
member of the game, and one on whom success
mainly depends. The ball must not weigh
more than five ounces and three quarters, nor
less than five ounces and a half.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bat must not be wider than four inches
and a half; its height, exclusive of the handle,
should be twenty-one inches. There is no
absolute law respecting the height of the bat;
this, however, is found to be the most convenient.</p>

<p class='c006'>The striker, or bats-man, is confined by a
line, cut parallel with his wicket, and four
feet distant from it. This line is termed the
popping crease. If he transgress this boundary
while the ball is in play, the wicket-keeper,
or any other player holding the ball,
is at liberty to put him out, by striking down
his wicket with the ball. This, however,
must always be done by means of the ball
itself; either by throwing it, or, if near
enough, by keeping the ball in hand at the
time of putting down the wicket.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wicket-keeper holds likewise an important
station in the game. He stands opposite
to the bowler, and behind the wicket at
which the striker is playing. The duties of
the wicket-keeper are too various to be detailed
in this work, which, of course, affects
no more than to give an outline of the principle
of the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the bowler and wicket-keeper, who
are the two most serviceable men in the
field; there are the first short slip, who stands
near to the wicket-keeper, consequently behind
the wicket, yet diagonally in front of
the batter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The point directly faces the striker. His
station is about seven yards from the popping-crease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The middle-wicket stands on the off side,
and about twenty-three yards from the striker’s
wicket.</p>

<p class='c006'>The leg or hip has his appointment about
sixteen yards from the popping-crease, behind
the batter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long-stop is placed behind the wicket-keeper,
to save the balls he may miss as they
come from the bowler; for the batters may
take the advantage of running when a ball
has been over-thrown, or has not been stopped
after the bowler has delivered it, although it
may not have been struck.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long slip stands in a line with the
striker, and between the point and short slip,
but farther out in the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>A man to cover the middle-wicket and the
point, stands on the off-side of the striker. It
is his duty to save those balls that either of
the above may have missed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long field on the off-side, stands between
the middle-wicket and the bowler, but
at a considerable distance, to save the hard
hits.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long field on the on-side, is stationed
at a great distance from the striker, and on
the other side of the bowler from the man last
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>After every four halls have been bowled,
the umpire calls “Over!” when the whole
party, who are seeking out, (with the exception,
of course, of the bowler and wicket-keeper)
change their positions to the opposite
quarters of the field.</p>

cut off, if laid on the remaining ear, will
serve to direct the operation in that also. A
rounded crop may be made at one cut. The
cropping of pug puppies is the most painful of
any; the cuts must, in general, be repeated,
and carried close to the root of the ear; as
upon the total absence of external ears (which
gives an appearance of roundness to the head)
is the beauty of the animal <i>supposed</i> to
consist.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Crossbill</span> (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>), <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This species weighs about an ounce and a
half; length near six inches and a half; bill
strong, both mandibles convex, and crossing
each other at the points, which are hooked;
colour brown; eyes small; irides dusky.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plumage of the male varies from a
beautiful red to orange-colour on the head,
neck, breast, back, and rump; the wing
coverts rufous brown; quills and tail dusky;
vent almost white; under tail coverts spotted
dusky; tail forked; legs short; claws strong.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females also vary somewhat in colour.
In general, they are of a dull olive-green on
those parts where the male is red; but the
feathers on the back are mottled with dusky;
the wings and tail similar to that of the male,
but not so dark. We have observed that the
crossing of the mandibles is not constantly on
the same side.</p>

<p class='c006'>That rare bird, the crossbill, occasionally
visits the orchards in our neighbourhood, coming
in little parties to feed on the seeds of the
apple, and, seldom as it appears, it is always
noticed by the mischief it does to the fruit,
cutting it asunder with its well constructed
mandibles, in order to obtain the kernels.
A native of those extensive pine forests in the
neighbourhood of the Rhine, it makes excursions
into various parts of Europe in search of
change of food; and though several instances
are recorded of its visits to our islands, I know
but one mentioned of its having bred in England.
A pair was brought to me very early
in August, and the breast of the female being
nearly bare of feathers, as is observed in sitting
birds, it is very probable that she had a
nest in the neighbourhood.—<i>Knapp</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Crottle</span>, <i>s.</i> A lichen which grows principally on sand stone, used in dyeing
hackles and wools.</p>

<p class='c006'>The power of crottle can never be known
but by length of boiling; for which reason,
get the largest copper pot you can. It ought
to hold thirty or forty quarts; then put three
quarts of crottle in, and fill it with water.
Separate the wool according to the number of
shades you wish for, put it into as many bags,
and let them boil <i>eight whole days</i>, or <i>as
long as you can stay</i> out of bed. You may
draw a bag every six hours, and if you wish
lighter shades, sooner. You are to get a
round thin deal board, (see there is no turpentine
in it,) bore it with holes that will
receive your fingers, put your lid over that,
and be careful of keeping your pot full of
water. After three days’ boiling, you must
put in two quarts more crottle, to bring up
your dark shades. I followed this plan for
a whole six days, and I got the finest colours
my eyes ever saw. I got so high a shade as
a rich claret brown under; and it was a very
rich cinnamon over head. The reason I have
mentioned eight days is on account of the
bags, which prevent the dye. I also mention
a copper pot, and you must use no other in any
dye. I never could clean the crottle properly
out of the fur for want of being in bags.

of iron used as a lever; the voice of a cock, or the noise which he makes

<p class='c006'>This species weighs about nineteen ounces;
length eighteen inches; bill black; irides
dusky. The whole plumage black, glossed
above with a purplish blue; legs black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Distinguished from the rook by the bill,
which is rather more convex towards the
end, and the nares, or reflected bristles, at the
base being always perfect; but these are
only obvious in adults. In young birds the
note is the only criterion of distinction, which
in this is much more hoarse than that of the
rook.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crow feeds on flesh, insects, and grain;
but is particularly fond of carrion. It frequently
attacks the eyes of dying animals,
and destroys weakly lambs; it will also pursue
birds on wing, when pressed by hunger.
We once saw this bird in pursuit of a pigeon,
at which it made several pounces, like a hawk;
but the pigeon escaped, by flying in at the
door of a house. We have also seen it strike
a pigeon dead from the top of a barn. It is a
great destroyer of young game and poultry.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a bold bird, always at war with the
lesser species of hawks; nor does the kite, the
buzzard, or the raven, approach its nest without
being attacked and driven away. At that
season, even the peregrine falcon is insulted,
who frequently at one pounce brings it to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eggs are four or five in number, of a
greenish colour, spotted with dusky and
ash-colour, their weight about five drachms.
Colonel Montagu observed two crows by the
sea-shore, busy in removing small fish beyond
the flux of the flowing tide, and depositing
them just above high-water mark, under the
broken rocks, after having satisfied the calls
of hunger. This species, like the magpie, is
extremely garrulous at the sight of a fox
or other small quadrupeds, and attacks and
makes prey of a half-grown hare. In a summer
evening ramble, Colonel Montagu saw
one of these birds make repeated pounces at
some animal in a field where the grass was
nearly a foot high, which appeared to raise
itself on its hind legs, and defend itself stoutly;
upon a nearer approach he discovered it to be
a young hare.—<i>Rennie.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cuckoo</i>, or <i>Gowk</i>.—(<i>Cuculus Canorus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Coucou</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Length fourteen
inches, breadth twenty-five; its bill is black
and somewhat bent; eyes yellow; inside of
the mouth red; its head, neck, back, and
wing coverts are of a pale blue, or dove colour,
which is darkest on the head and back, and
palest on the fore part of the neck and rump;
its breast and belly are white, elegantly crossed
with wavy bars of black; the quill feathers
are dusky, their inner webs marked with
large oval white spots; the tail is long; the
two middle feathers are black, with white
tips; the others dusky, marked with alternate
spots of white on each side the shaft: the legs
are short and of a yellow colour; toes two
forward, and two backward; claws white.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cuckoo visits us early in the spring;
its well-known cry is generally heard about
the middle of April, and ceases the latter end
of June; its stay is short, the old cuckoos
being said to quit this country early in July.
Cuckoos build no nest; and, what is more
extraordinary, the female deposits her solitary
egg in the nest of another bird, by which it is
hatched. The nest she chooses for this purpose
is generally selected from the following,
viz., the hedge sparrows, water wagtails, titlarks,
yellow hammers, green linnets, or the
winchats. Of these it has been observed that
she shows a much greater partiality to that of
the hedge sparrow than to any of the rest.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cup</span>, <i>v.</i> To draw blood by applying cupping glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cur</span>, <i>s.</i> A worthless degenerate dog.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Curb</span>, <i>s.</i> An iron chain, made fast to the upper part of the branches of the
bridle, running over the beard of the horse; restraint.</p>

<p class='c006'>Curb is an enlargement at the back of the
hock, about three or four inches below the
point of the hock. It is either a strain in the
ring-like ligament which binds the tendons
down in their place, or in the sheath of the
tendons; oftener, we are inclined to think, of
the ligament than of the sheath. Any sudden
action of the limb of more than usual violence
may produce it, and therefore horses are found
to ‘throw out curbs’ after a hardly contested
race, an extraordinary leap, a severe gallop
over heavy ground, or a sudden check in the
gallop. Young horses are particularly liable
to it, and horses that are <i>cow-hocked</i> or whose
hocks and legs resemble those of the cow, the
hocks being turned inward, and the legs forming
a considerable angle outwards. This is intelligible
enough; for in hocks so formed, the
annular ligament must be continually on the
stretch to confine the tendon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Curbs are generally accompanied by considerable
lameness at their first appearance, but
the swelling is not always great; indeed, it
sometimes presents so gradual a curve, that it
is scarcely perceivable when we stand behind
the horse, and both the horseman and the veterinary
surgeon have overlooked it. It is
best detected by observing the leg sideway.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first object in attempting the cure is to
abate inflammation, and this will be most readily
accomplished by cold evaporating lotions,
frequently applied to the part. Equal portions
of spirit of wine, water, and vinegar, will
afford an excellent application. It will be
almost impossible to keep a bandage on. If
the heat and lameness are considerable, it will
be prudent to physic the horse, and to bleed
from the subcutaneous vein. Whether the
injury be of the annular ligament, or the
sheath of the tendon, more active means will
be necessary to perfect the cure. Either a
liquid blister should be rubbed on the part,
consisting of a vinous or turpentine tincture
of cantharides, and this daily applied until some
considerable swelling takes place, which should
be allowed to subside, and then the liniment
again resorted to; or, what is the preferable
plan, the hair should be cut off, and the part
blistered as soon as the heat has been subdued.
The blister should be repeated until the horse
goes sound, and the swelling has disappeared.
In severe cases it may be necessary to fire,
but we cannot recommend the indiscriminate
recourse to the hot iron in every case of curb,
and we would uniformly give a fair trial to
milder measures. If the iron be used, the
strokes should be in straight lines.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are few complaints in which absolute
and long continued rest is more requisite, than
in curb. An injury so serious leaves the parts
very materially weakened, and, if the horse be
soon put to work again, the lameness will frequently
return. No horse that has had curbs
should be put even to ordinary work in less
than a month after the apparent cure, and even
then he should very gradually resume his former
habits. A horse with a curb is manifestly
unsound.</p>

waterfowl.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_145.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The bill is long, equally incurvated, and
terminated in a blunt point; nostrils linear,
and longitudinal near the base; tongue short
and sharp-pointed; and the toes are connected
as far as the first joint, by a membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the curlew, Linnæus begins a numerous
tribe of birds under the generic name of
<i>scolopax</i>, which, in his arrangement, includes
all the snipes and godwits, amounting, according
to Latham, to forty-two species and eight
varieties, spread over various parts of the
world, but nowhere very numerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Buffon describes fifteen species and varieties
of the curlew, and Latham ten, only two
or three of which are British birds. They
feed upon worms, which they pick up on the
surface, or with their bills dig from the soft
earth: on these they depend for their principal
support; but they also devour the various
kinds of insects which swarm in the mud,
and in the wet boggy grounds, where these
birds chiefly take up their abode.</p>

<p class='c006'>The curlew generally measures about two
feet in length, and from tip to tip above three
feet. The bill is about seven inches long, of
a regular curve, and tender substance at the
point, which is blunt. The upper mandible
is black, gradually softening into brown toward
the base; the under one flesh-coloured.
The head, neck, upper part of the back, and
wing-coverts, are of a pale brown, the middle
of each feather black, edged and deeply indented
with pale rust colour, or light grey.
The breast, belly, and lower part of the beak,
are dull white, the latter thinly spotted with
black, and the two former with oblong strokes
more thickly set, of the same colour. The
quill-feathers are black, the inner webs crossed
or spotted with white; the tail is barred with
black, on a white ground tinged with red;
the legs are bare a little above the knees, of
a blueish colour, and the toes are thick, and
flat on the under side.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds differ much in size, as well as
in the different shades of their plumage;
some of them weighing not more than twenty-two
ounces, and others as much as thirty-seven.
In the plumage of some the white
parts are much more distinct and clear than
in others, which are more uniformly grey,
and tinged with pale brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is so nearly like the male, that
any particular description of her is unnecessary:
she makes her nest upon the ground,
in a dry tuft of rushes or grass, of such
withered materials as are found near, and lays
four eggs, of a greenish cast, spotted with
brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The curlew is met with by travellers in
most parts of Europe, from Iceland to the
Mediterranean islands. In Britain their summer
residence is upon the large heathy, boggy
moors, where they breed. Their food consists
of worms, flies, and insects, which they
pick out of the soft mossy ground by the
marshy pools, which are common in such
places. In winter they depart to the sea-side,
where they are seen in great numbers, and
then live upon the worms, marine insects,
and other fishy substances which they pick up
on the beach and among the loose rocks and
pools left by the retiring tide. The flesh of
the curlew has been characterised by some as
very good, and of a fine flavour—by others as
directly the reverse; the truth is, that, while
they are in health and season, and live on the
moors, scarcely any bird can excel them in
goodness; but when they have lived some
time on the sea shore, they acquire a rank
and fishy taste.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_147.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Cutters have been always favourite vessels,
from their excellent sailing qualities, and,
consequently, are much employed as revenue
cruisers, smugglers, privateers, and packets,
and in any trade requiring much despatch.
A cutter under one hundred tons is sufficiently
handy and manageable, but when the
size increases to that of the larger yachts and
cruisers, a very strong crew is necessary, as
the spars are immensely heavy, and a number
of men requisite to set or shorten sail.</p>

<p class='c006'>A single-masted vessel is objectionable,
because in the event of springing a spar, she
becomes perfectly helpless; hence large cutters
are only used in short voyages, or as coasting
cruisers. Their peculiar qualities of beating
well to windward, and working on short
tacks, adapt them for channel cruising; and
in case of accident, they can always manage to
reach some harbour or anchorage where they
can repair the damage they may have sustained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some years back, large cutters were confined
principally to the navy and revenue,
but the Royal Yacht Club have not only
exceeded them in size, but also in beauty and
sailing. Some of the finest and fastest cutters
in the world are the property of this
celebrated and truly national club; and two
of them, the <i>Alarm</i> (Mr. Wild’s), and the
<i>Arundel</i> (the Duke of Norfolk’s), measure
193 and 188 tons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inconvenient size of a cutter’s boom
and mainsail has caused the introduction very
generally of a ketch rig; which, by the addition
of a mizen, enables the boom to be
dispensed with, and reduces the mainsail considerably.
This rig, when the mizen stands
well, is very elegant, and, if a vessel is short-handed,
exceedingly handy.—<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Yacht</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cygnet</span>, <i>s.</i> A young swan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Living on the banks of the Thames, I have
often been pleased with seeing the care taken
of the young swans by the parent birds. Where
the stream is strong, the old one will sink herself
sufficiently low to bring her back on a
level with the water, when the cygnets will get
upon it, and in this manner are conveyed to
the other side of the river, or into stiller water.
Each family of swans on the river has its own
district; and if the limits of that district are
encroached upon by other swans, a pursuit immediately
takes place, and the intruders are
driven away. Except in this instance, they
appear to live in a state of the most perfect
harmony. The male is very attentive to the
female, assists in making the nest, and when a
sudden rise of the river takes place, joins her
with great assiduity in raising the nest sufficiently
high to prevent the eggs being chilled by
the action of the water, though sometimes its
rise is so rapid, that the whole nest is washed
away and destroyed.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p>DACE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dace or Dare, is gregarious, is a great
breeder, very lively, and during summer is
fond of frolicking near the surface. Its head
is small, the irides of a pale yellow; the
body long and slender; its scales are smaller
than those of the roach, and is upon the whole
a handsomer fish; the back is varied with
dusky, and a cast of yellowish green; the
sides and belly silvery, the ventral, anal, and
caudal fins are sometimes of a pale red hue;
the tail is very much forked. The dace is
seldom above ten inches long, although in a
list of fish sold in the London markets, with
the greatest weight of each, communicated to
Mr. Pennant, there is an account of one that
weighed a pound and half, and according to
Linnæus, it grows to a foot and half in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>The haunts of Dace are deep water, near
piles of bridges, where the stream is gentle,
over gravelly, sandy, and clayey bottoms;
deep holes that are shaded, water-lily leaves,
and under the foam caused by an eddy; in
the warm months they are to be found in
shoals on the shallows near to streams; the
dace spawn in March, are in season about three
weeks after; they improve, and are very good,
about Michaelmas, but are best in February,
and are said in that month, when just taken,
scotched, and broiled, to be more palatable
than a fresh herring.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a fish affording great sport to the
angler, indeed more pleasure than profit, for
the flesh is insipid, and full of bones. The
baits for dace are the red worm, brandling,
gilt-tail, cow-dung, and earth-bob, and indeed
any worm bred on trees or bushes, that is not
too big for his mouth, and almost every kind
of fly and caterpillar. Flesh flies upon the
surface with the hook put into the back, between
the wings, the line from the middle
downwards of single hairs, and a trifle longer
than the rod, which ought to be eighteen feet
at least, and as light as possible; the flies can
be kept in a phial; fix three very small hooks
upon single hair links, not above four inches
along the line, and in a summer’s evening, at
the smoothest part of the end of a mill-stream,
from seven or eight, so long as light
continues, the dace will yield diversion. In
the same manner, they will rise in the morning
at the ant-fly, if used at the foot of a
current or mill-stream, or on a scour before
the sun comes on the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>After rains, when the river is nearly level
with its banks, use a caterpillar-fly, or a small
red palmer and yellow-gentle (the yellower
the better), run the hook through its skin, and
draw it up to the tail of the fly, then whip on
the surface, the dace will rise freely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another way to take this fish, from the
middle of April until the beginning of October,
is by artificial fly-fishing, with a long
line.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This dog has been erroneously called the
Danish dog by some authors, and Buffon, and
some other naturalists, imagine him to be the
harrier of Bengal; but his native country is
Dalmatia, a mountainous district of European
Turkey. He has been domesticated in Italy
for upwards of two centuries, and is the common
harrier of that country.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Dalmatian is also used as a pointer, to
which his natural propensity more inclines him
than to be a dog of the chase; he is said to be
easily broken, and to be very staunch. He is
handsome in shape, something betwixt the British
foxhound and English pointer; his head
is more acute than that of the latter, and his
ears fully longer: his general colour is white,
and his whole body and legs are covered with
small irregular sized black or reddish brown
spots. He is much smaller than the large
Danish dog. A singular opinion prevailed at
one time in this country, that this beautiful
dog was rendered more handsome by having
his ears cropped: this barbarous fancy is now
quickly dying away.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have never heard of the Dalmatian being
trained to the sports of the field in Great Britain.
His only use seems to be an elegant attendant
upon a carriage, for which the symmetry
of his form and beauty of his skin peculiarly
fit him. A most erroneous notion has
prevailed among some breeders, that neither
this nor the great Danish dog has the sense of
smell. They have been indiscriminately called
the coach-dog.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Decoy</span>, <i>v.</i> To lure into a cage, to entrap.</p>

<p class='c006'>The decoys now in use are formed by cutting
pipes, or tapering ditches, widened and
deepened as they approach the water; in various
semicircular directions, through the swampy
ground, into particular large pools, which
are sheltered by surrounding trees or bushes,
and situated commonly in the midst of the solitary
marsh. At the narrow points of these
ditches farthest from the pool, by which they
are filled with water, the fowlers place their
funnel nets: from these the ditch is covered
by a continued arch of netting, supported by
hoops, to the desired distance; and all along
both sides, screens formed of reeds are set up
so as to prevent the possibility of the birds
seeing the decoyman; and as these birds feed
during the night, all is ready prepared for this
sport in the evening. The fowler, then placed
on the leeward side, sometimes with the help
of his well-trained dog, but always by that of
his better trained tame decoy ducks, begins the
business of destruction. The latter, directed
by his well known whistle, or excited forward
by the floating hempseed, which he strews occasionally
upon the water, entice all the wild
ducks after them under the netting; and as
soon as this is observed, the man or his dog, as
the fitness of opportunity may direct, is from
the rear exposed to the view of the birds, by
which they are so alarmed that they dare not
offer to return, and are prevented by the nets
from escaping upwards: they therefore press
forward in the utmost confusion to the end of
the pipe, into the purse nets there prepared to
receive them, while their treacherous guides
remain behind in conscious security. The season
allowed by act of parliament for catching
these birds in this way, continues only from
the latter end of October till February.</p>

<p class='c006'>Particular spots or decoys, in the fen countries,
are let to the fowlers at a rent of from
five to thirty pounds per annum; and Pennant
instances a season in which thirty-one thousand
two hundred ducks, including teals and
widgeons, were sold in London only, from ten
of these decoys near Wainfleet, in Lincolnshire.
Formerly, according to Willoughby,
the ducks, while in moult and unable to fly,
were driven by men in boats, furnished with
long poles, with which they splashed the water,
between long nets, stretched vertically
across the pools, in the shape of two sides of a
triangle, into lesser nets placed at the point,
and in this way, he says four thousand were
taken at one driving in Deeping-fen; and Latham
has quoted an instance of two thousand
six hundred and forty-six being taken in two
days, near Spalding in Lincolnshire; but this
manner of catching them while in moult is
now prohibited.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not unfrequently a subject of inquiry,
how it may be possible to destroy a dog with
least pain to himself, and least shock to the
feelings of his owner. Although shooting
and hanging are not, in themselves, painful
deaths, yet the violence necessarily committed
is revolting to one’s feelings. Whenever,
therefore, cases arise (and many such do occur)
where it would be infinitely more humane to
destroy an animal than to prolong a miserable
existence, and when the more usual modes
are objected to on account of the violence
and force necessary, either of these essential
oils, <i>cherry laurel, and bitter almond</i>,
dropped on the tongue, or a very small ball

diabetes, when the urine has become
stinking and high coloured, the cure is more
difficult. Rest, or voluntary exercise only,

colour.)—Take a pint of strong ale, half a
pound of soot, a small quantity of the juice of
walnut leaves, and an equal quantity of alum
powdered fine; mix them well, and boil them
in a pipkin half an hour; when the mixture
is cold, put in the hair, and let it remain ten
or twelve hours.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some boil a quarter of a pound of soot in a
pint of strong alum water, with a little juice
of walnut leaves, for half an hour, and steep
the hair in it when nearly cold.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>For a <i>brown</i>, take some powdered alum,
boil it well until dissolved; then add a pound
of walnut-tree bark, from the branches when
the sap is up, or the buds or green nuts; boil
it in an hour, and let it stand. When after
skimming it for ten minutes, put in the gut
or hair for about a minute (stirring it round),
or until you like the colour. If it continues
too long, it will become quite dark and injure
the hair. The lighter it is tinged with this
colour, the better. Salt and ale will also give
hair a brownish cast that is steeped in it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>For a blueish water colour, proceed as
above; only add logwood instead of the
walnut, and be careful not to colour it too
much.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Yellow.</i>—The inner bark of a crab-tree
boiled in water with some alum, makes a fine
yellow, which is excellent when the weeds
rot, the line appearing of the same hue.
Another dye may be obtained from two quarts
of small ale, and three handfuls of walnut
leaves bruised therein; the hair to remain in
it until tinged to your wish.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Tawny</i> is prepared from lime and water

<p class='c006'><i>Russet.</i>—Take a pint of strong lye, half
a pound of soot, some juice of walnut leaves,
and a quart of alum water; put them together
into a pan, boil them well, and when the
liquor is cold, steep the hair until it acquires
the colour you desire.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>General Remark.</i>—The hair to be dyed,
should always be the best white: the seasons
for using dyed hair, are, September and two
following months; the yellow, russet all the
winter, and until the end of April, as well in
rivers as in lakes; for the same periods, the
brown and tawny should be used in blackish,
heathy, and moorish waters.</p>

Black, by brushing it over with logwood,
boiled in vinegar, then washing it over with

<p class='c006'><i>The Distemper.</i>—No disorder is more
general or so destructive as that known by
the name of the distemper; it is the most
fatal (the plague only excepted) that any
animal is subject to.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of the distemper are not
invariably similar, although there are predominant
ones which always occur. It generally
comes on with a dry husky cough,
dullness and want of appetite, a running from
the nose and eyes, and loss of flesh. As the
disease advances, the dog appears much emaciated,
and grows excessively weak, particularly
in the loins and hinder extremities;
usually there is convulsive twitchings of
different parts, most commonly of the head,
attended with dimness of sight; when the
disease proceeds, and takes on its more virulent
form, then the twitches degenerate into
continued convulsive fits, the dog foams at
the mouth, runs round, and expresses great
pain, has a constant disposition to dung, with
obstinate costiveness or incessant purging.
There is likewise great irritability of the
stomach, every thing being thrown up immediately
it is taken in, and the animal dies,
generally, in one of the spasmodic fits. From
this state of the disease hardly any dog recovers,
unless from the powerful effect of
this gentleman’s medicine, and even then he
admits its success doubtful, although he insists,
with the medicine early given, the disease
will never arrive to this height; but, with
every deference to the efficacy of the above
medicine, the compiler has known Dr. James’s
powder cure the most inveterate stages of the
disorder: the method of administering it will
be hereafter directed. In every part of this
disease a want of nervous energy, and a particular
paralytic affection of the nerves, is apparent,
and, in some instances, remains long after
every other symptom has ceased, and in many
respects is not unlike the palsy of the human
frame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distemper, when existing in its worst
form, is very often mistaken for canine madness;
but a close attention to the following
points will with certainty show the difference.
Puppies are not so liable to madness as full-grown
dogs; it is but seldom the animal will
drink freely in the distemper, never in madness—yet
they will now and then try to
drink; the hydrophobia arrives likewise at
its height, in general, sooner than the distemper,
although the latter is sometimes
equally sudden in its attack, and rapid in its
progress. In madness, all recollection of
places or persons is lost by the affected animal;
his home will be left, and he will bite
the hand that feeds him, indiscriminately with
any other. In the distemper, there is no loss
of reason but in the attack and actual continuance
of the convulsion fits; the animal
does not attempt to bite or rove abroad, and,
on recovery from the fit, resumes his faculties.
If, therefore, a young dog will drink
when the immediate effect of the spasmodic
restriction is removed, or, without evident
fear, will bear the sight of water, but more
particularly when his weakness is excessive,
and strongly apparent between the intervals
of the fits, it may be safely concluded that it
is the distemper, and not madness. These
circumstances, continues Mr. Blaine, should
be carefully remarked, as they are unerring,
and may save many a valuable animal from
destruction, and many a timid mind from the
most dreadful apprehension.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>For the distemper, so soon as the symptoms
appear, give an ounce of castor oil, and
after its operation has ceased, give the following
powder, mixed up with butter, into a
bolus, every two hours, keeping the dog
warm, and supplying him frequently with
warm milk or water-gruel. Should the medicine
occasion sickness or purging, the quantity
and frequency of the doses are to be
abated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Crocus metallorum finely levigated, and
white antimonial powder, each six grains, and
diaphoretic calx of antimony, ten grains for
one dose.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is necessary to remark, that the above
dose is sufficient for a pointer or fox-hound,
of six or eight months old, and that the quantity
is to be varied according to the size and
age of the dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rhubarb and jalap mixed, as much as will
lie on a shilling, is an excellent common physic.
For dogs, foul within, five grains of
tartar emetic, given in a piece of hog’s lard.
For a surfeit, one ounce of sulphur, half an
ounce of antimony, mixed together; a small
ball in butter, to be given to the dog, and the
sore place well rubbed with a mixture of
white hellebore-root powdered, and hog’s
lard; the dog to be kept from water if he
licks the ointment.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Doctor Darwin has given the following
opinion upon the disorder, and how to counteract
its malignity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In dogs, the catarrh is generally joined
with symptoms of debility early in the disease;
the animals should be permitted to go
about in the open air, the use of being as
much as may be in the air, is evident, because
all the air which they breathe, passes twice
over the putrid sloughs of the mortified parts
of the membrane, which lines the nostrils,
and the maxillary and frontal cavities; that
is, during inspiration and expiration, and must,
therefore, be loaded with contagious particles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fresh new milk, and fresh broth, should be
given them very frequently, and they should
be suffered to go amongst the grass, which
they sometimes eat for the purpose of an
emetic; and, if possible, they should have
access to a running stream of water, as the
contagious mucus of the nostrils generally
drops into the water they attempt to drink.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bits of raw flesh, if the dog will eat them,
are preferred to cooked meat, and from five to
ten drops of tincture of opium (according to
the size of the dog), may be given with advantage
when symptoms of debility are evident,
every six hours. If sloughs can be
seen in the nostrils, they should be moistened
twice a day with a solution of sugar of lead,
or of alum, by means of a sponge fixed on a
bit of whalebone, or by a syringe. The lotion
may be made by dissolving half an ounce
of sugar of lead, or of alum, in a pint of
water.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following remedies have their advocates,
and, consequently, in some cases of the
disorder have been proved essential in its cure.</p>

<p class='c006'>One grain and a half of calomel, and five
grains of rhubarb, to be repeated every other
day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four grains of Turbith’s mineral, and one
grain of emetic tartar; first bleeding the dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>A tea-spoonful of jalap, half the quantity
of grated ginger, a table-spoonful of syrup of
buckthorn, made into a ball, or given liquid
in warm water. No milk, but water-gruel to
drink, and the dog must be kept very warm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gamboge, dragon’s-blood, jesuit’s-bark, of
each half an ounce, made into pills the size
of a hazel nut. To a full grown dog, one
pill to be given every morning until cured;
to a whelp, three times a week, the dogs to
have liberty to run out.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some rely entirely on purgatives: others
bleeding and physicking; others on emetics;
some put tar upon the nose, others a pitch
plaster, and some cauterize the nasals; some
inject vinegar into the dose, others hellebore,
and others a solution of camphor; some cut
off the tail, others the ears; some give tobacco
and olive oil, others the golden sulphuret
of antimony; the keeper gives the
curpeth’s mineral: the more scientific of these
gentry will knock down the disease, and the
dog too with arsenic. The gentleman will give
compound tincture of benzoin, the farmer
common salt; the medical man sulphuric
ether, or emetics and sulphur, or emetics and
jalap, or emetics and scammony.—<i>Youatt</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Darwin.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>In ancient manuscripts we find the following
names for the dogs employed in the sports of
the field; that is to say, raches, or hounds;
running hounds or harriers, to chase hares; and
greyhounds, which were favourite dogs with the
sportsmen; alauntes, or bull-dogs, these were
chiefly used for hunting the boar; the mastiff
is also said to be “a good hounde” for
hunting the wild boar; the spaniel was of use
in hawking; “hys crafte,” says the author,
“is for the perdrich or partridge, and the
quaile; and, when taught to couch, he is
very serviceable to the fowlers, who take
those birds with nets.” There must, I presume,
have been a vast number of other kinds
of dogs known in England at this period;
these, however, are all that the early writers,
upon the subject of hunting, have thought
proper to enumerate. In the sixteenth century
the list is enlarged; besides those already
named, we find bastards and mongrels, lemors,
kenets, terrours, butcher’s hounds, dunghill
dogs, trindel-tail’d dogs, “pryckeared” curs,
and ladies’ small puppies.</p>

<p class='c006'>There formerly existed a very cruel law,
which subjected all the dogs that were found
in the royal chases and forests, excepting such
as belonged to privileged persons, to be maimed
by having the left claw cut from their feet,
unless they were redeemed by a fine; this
law probably originated with the Normans,
and certainly was in force in the reign of
Henry I.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Linnæus, in his System of Nature, has
placed the dog as the second genus of the
third order of mammiferous animals, or those
which suckle their young by means of lactiferous
teats.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters of the third order, <span class='sc'>Feræ</span>,
are as follows:—The fore teeth are conic,
usually six in each jaw; the <i>tusks</i> are
longer, the <i>grinders</i> have conic projections;
the feet have claws, which are usually subulate,
or awl-shaped; they feed on carcasses,
and prey on other animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters of the genus <i>Canis</i>, or
Dog, are, six cutting teeth in the upper jaw;
those at the sides longer than the intermediate
ones, which are lobated. In the under jaw
there are also six cutting teeth, the lateral
ones lobated; there are four canine teeth, one
on each side, both above and below, and from
six to seven grinders. The specific characters
of the <i>Canis Familiaris</i>, or common dog,
are, the head is carinated, or keel-shaped on
the crown, the lower lip is hid by the upper,
indentated and naked at the sides; the tongue
is smooth; on the upper lip are five or six
rows of whiskers; the nostrils are turned
outwards into a crescent-shaped furrow; the
upper margin of the ears is reflected and posteriorly
doubled; the anterior margin is
three-lobed, and there are seven or eight
hairy warts on the face. There are ten teats,
four of them pectoral, and six abdominal;
the feet are subpalmated, with claws on the
toes, which are long, a little curved, and not
retractile within the toes, as is the case with
those of the cat.</p>

<p class='c006'>He has, besides the above anatomical distinctions,
other general characters which are
peculiar to his tribe.</p>

<p class='c006'>He delights in associating with man, feeds
on flesh, carcasses, and farinaceous vegetables,
digests bones, is vomited by eating grass,
which he does instinctively; drinks by lapping,
runs obliquely, resting upon his toes;
perspires by his tongue, which he lolls out
when warm; when lying down turns often
round; hears in his sleep, and dreams frequently.
Of all animals the most faithful;
fawns at the appearance of his master, and
defends him; runs before him in a journey,
and if the road divides, looks back and generally
waits to see which he takes: will turn
to the branch to which he is directed from a
distance; his sense of smell is exquisite.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cuvier, in his Animal Kingdom, gives the
following generic character of the dog, which
differs but little from that of Linnæus, except
in his new and more distinct terminology.</p>

<p class='c006'>The upper cheek teeth are six on each
side, the three first are sharp, trenchant,
called by Cuvier <i>false molars</i>; the following,
a carnivorous tooth, has two cutting
lobes, beyond which, on each side, are two
flat teeth. In the lower jaw there are seven;
four false molars, a carnivorous tooth, has
two cutting lobes, beyond which, on each
side, are two flat teeth, and two tuberculous
teeth behind it. The length of the jaws and
muzzle vary greatly; the tongue is smooth;
the ears are extremely variable; there are
five toes on the fore-feet, and four on those
behind, furnished with longish nails, obtuse,
and not retractile, and the mammæ are ventral;
the eye-pupils are circular and diurnal,
or formed for seeing by day.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dogs exempt from Duty.</i>—Whelps which

</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of this bird is about nine inches.
Its bill is black; eyes dark, large, and full;
its forehead is mottled with brown and white
top of the head black; over each eye an
arched line of white passes to the hinder part
of the neck; the cheeks and throat are white;
the back and wings are of a light brown, inclining
to olive, each feather margined with
pale rust colour; the quills are brown. The
forepart of the neck is surrounded by a broad
band of a light olive colour, bordered on the
under side with white. The breast is of a
pale dull orange; middle of the belly black;
the rest of the belly, thighs, and vent, are of
a reddish white; the tail is of an olive brown,
black near the end, and tipped with white,
the outer feathers are margined with white.
The legs are of a dark olive colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dotterel is common in various parts of
Great Britain, though in some places it is
scarcely known. They are supposed to breed
in the mountains of Cumberland and Westmoreland,
where they are sometimes seen in
the month of May, during the breeding season;
they likewise breed on several of the
Highland hills. They are very common in
Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, and Derbyshire,
appearing in small flocks on the heaths and
moors of those counties during the months of
May and June, and are then very fat, and
much esteemed for the table. It is said that
the dotterel is so very stupid a bird, as to be
taken with the most simple artifice, and that
it was formerly the custom to decoy them
into the net by stretching out a leg or an arm
which caught the attention of the birds, so
that they returned it by a similar motion of a
leg or a wing, and were not aware till the
net dropped and covered the whole flock. At
present the more sure method of the gun has
superseded this artifice.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>The Ring Dotterell.</i>—(<i>Ring Plover</i>, or
<i>Sea Lark</i>; <i>Charadrius Heaticula</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Petit Pluvier à collier</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The
length is rather more than seven inches. The
bill is of an orange colour, tipped with black; the
eyes are dark hazel; a black hue passes from
the bill, underneath each eye, and spreads
over the cheeks; above this a line of white
extends across the forehead to the eyes; this
is bounded above by a black fillet across the
head; a gorget of black encircles the neck,
very broad on the forepart, but growing narrow
behind, above which, to the chin, is
white; the top of the head is of a light brown
ash-colour, as are also the back, scapulars,
and coverts; the greater coverts are tipped with
white; the breast and the under parts are
white; the quills are dusky, with an oval
white spot about the middle of each feather,
which forms, when the wings are closed, a
stroke of white down each; the tail is of a
dark brown, tipped with white, the two outer
feathers almost white; the legs are of an orange
colour; claws black. In the female the white
on the forehead is much less; there is more
white on the wings, and the plumage inclines
more to ash-colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are common in all the northern
counties; they migrate into Britain in the
spring, and depart in autumn: they frequent
the sea-shores during summer, and run nimbly
along the sands, sometimes taking short
flights, accompanied with loud twitterings,
then alight and run again; if disturbed, they
fly right off. They are said to make no
nest: the female lays four eggs, of a pale
ash-colour, spotted with black, which she
deposits on the ground.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

a kind of car drawn by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Drag-net</span>, <i>s.</i> A net which is drawn along the bottom of the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making a drag-net, the size of the
mesh should never be less than one inch and
a quarter; there should be an extent of
three times in length, and twice in depth of
the plain net, before it is hung upon the cork
and lead lines (that is, if the drag is meant
to be twenty yards long, and twelve feet
deep, there must be sixty yards of net in
length, and twenty-four feet in depth for a
sheet-drag; if made with a cod, it must be
let in with great care as to the widenings, so
that in fishing, it keeps a proper open centre).
As drag-nets are usually hung, any one who
is in the water when they are used, will feel,
when the lines are hauled, the lead-line above
the calf of his leg, and frequently above his
knee, and that continued to very near the
bosom of the net. There is no occasion to
remark upon the chance of success such an
implement affords.</p>

<p class='c006'>Always use two, if not three flews with
the drag: one or two flews can then be kept
forward for the drag to force to, and in fishing
every hole, back the drag with a flew; that
is, after the drag approaches close to the first
flew, of course that will be pulled on one or
other side of the river. If any fish are in it
they should be taken out, and so soon as the
drag-net has passed, let the flew be pulled
back into its former station; the fish that are
disturbed by the drag (from the different
manner in which their lead-lines have been
shown to keep a regular sweep at the bottom),
soon perceive an opening to escape beneath
it, and in striking to their old harbours,
run head-long into the back flew; the discolouring
of the water, from the trampling of
the people in, together with the motion of
some part of the drag upon the mud, all contribute
to the success of this expedient, by
which the best fish will always be captured.</p>

<p class='c006'>A drag-net should always be used up the
stream; however low the water in a river
may be drained for the convenience of those
fishing in it, there will still be a current sufficient
to preserve the water clear enough for
stumps and hangs of various descriptions to
be avoided, besides the drain of the water
keeps the meshes of the net extended, and
enables it to fish with every advantage; on
the contrary, when drawing down the stream,
the mudding of the water progressively prevents
the discovery of stubs, &amp;c., that would
injure the net, and aid the escape of the fish,
and, moreover, drives the net into folds, which
the leaves of the weeds turning the same way,
not a little assist.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

money.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Draughting.</i>—This fishing is confined to
the estuary, where the river meets the sea.
Here, according to naturalists, the salmon
undergo a probationary course, before they
exchange the salt for the fresh water, as a
sudden change from either would be fatal to
the fish, and a temporary sojourn in water of
an intermediate quality (brackish), is supposed
to be requisite, before they can leave either
the ocean or the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>The draughting is carried on at the last
quarter of the ebb, and during the first of the
flood; five or six boats, with as many men in
each, are necessary. When the salmon are
seen, the nearest boat starts off, leaving a man
on shore, with a rope attached to one extremity
of the net, which is rapidly thrown
over, as the boat makes an extensive circle
round the place where the fish are supposed
to lie. Returning to the shore, the curve of
the net is gradually decreased. Stones are
flung in at each extremity, to prevent the
salmon from escaping; the net reaches the
bank, the semicircle is complete, and all
within effectually secured. The fish are then
carefully landed, and at a single draught five
hundred salmon have been taken. This is,
however, an event of rare occurrence, and
unless the net were powerfully strong, and
the fishers skilful, a fracture, and consequently
a general escape, would be inevitable.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is extraordinary how much the flavour
and quality of the salmon depends on circumstances
apparently of trifling moment. A single
day in the river will injure, and a flood
spoil their condition; and a difference between
a fish taken in the nets, and one killed
with a rod, will be easily perceptible.—<i>Wild

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Drench</span>, <i>v.</i> To saturate with drink or moisture; to physic by violence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though an inconvenient method of giving
medicine to horses, it is preferable, on some
occasions, on account of the medicine acting
in much <i>less</i> time than in a solid form. In
flatulent colic, or gripes, where the symptoms
are alarming, a proper drench will relieve the
animal, while a ball would be useless.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best instrument for giving drenches is
the horn of an ox; the opening being cut
obliquely, in the form of a spout. Bottles
are sometimes used, on an emergency, to give
drenches; but they are attended with danger,
and should be handled cautiously. In
giving a drench, the horse’s tongue should be
held with the left hand; and when the head
is sufficiently elevated, the medicine is to be
carefully poured into the throat, immediately
letting go the tongue, while the head is kept
up until the drench is swallowed. Drenches
are very seldom given with dexterity, and
a great part of the medicine is sometimes
wasted. Every groom should learn to give
them with facility, and always keep a proper
instrument in the stable. In giving a drench,
the head should not be kept so high as it
generally is, nor should the throat be pressed
or rubbed, as it often is, with a view to make
the horse swallow, as it is apt to excite coughing.
In severe colds or strangles, there is
often some degree of soreness or inflammation
of the throat, by which swallowing is rendered
difficult and painful. In such cases no attempt
should be made to give either a drench or a
ball, as the complaint would be increased by
it; and if at any time a horse happens to
cough or appear distressed, while taking a
drench, his head should be immediately let
down. Hot stimulating medicines, or such
as are very nauseous, are better given in the
form of balls than drenches. Drenches should
always be given with as much gentleness as
possible; the horn may generally be introduced
with ease, merely by pressing down
the tongue with the fingers of the left hand,
instead of dragging it out, as is commonly
done. A small quantity only of the liquid
should be given at once; about six or eight
ounces, or even less, when tincture of opium
or any powerful medicine is given; and it is
of importance to be accurate in the dose, and
not to give either more or less than a certain
quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'>In locked-jaw it is very difficult to give a
drench, unless a small horn is kept for the
purpose, and even then a good deal of dexterity
and perseverance are often required to
effect it. In some cases the jaws are so completely
closed, and the muscles of deglutition
so affected, that a drench cannot be given;
and then the only method of conveying the
medicine into the body is in the form of
clyster. (<i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Clyster</span>.)—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>We all know that a jean, nankeen, or any
kind of thin jacket, is the pleasantest wear
for September, one of fustian for October, and
one of velveteen for the winter; and that,
for a man, who at all times uses but one
kind of jacket, fustian would be about the
medium. After having tried almost every
thing that is commonly used, and some of
the wretched articles that are puffed by advertisement,
I have found nothing so good for
a light summer jacket as what is made at
Manchester by the name of satteen, jeanet,
or florentine, which is printed on each side,
in imitation of cloth. This stuff far surpasses
the others for lightness, comfort, durability,
and every thing that can be required
for warm weather.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Shoes and Gaiters.</i>—To say nothing of
being tormented with two or three dozen of
buttons every morning, and having your ankles
and knees in a state of confinement
through a hard day’s exercise, it need only
be observed, that, if you step in the least
puddle, you are wet; if you tread in moist
ground, your shoe is pulled down at heel, and
you are often liable to be annoyed by your
shoes untying, and thorns and bits of stick,
&amp;c., getting into them, or between the buttons
of your gaiters. How much more comfortable,
then, is the dress here recommended!
With lamb’s-wool stockings and flannel drawers,
put on a pair of overall boots, and then
draw over them a pair of trowsers, which may
be made either of fustian or leather, and so
strongly defended inside the knees, that no
thorn can penetrate. Thus you are equipped
without trouble or loss of time, you have
your muscles perfectly at liberty for hard
exercise, and are free from every annoyance;
not to say a word on the advantage and safety
you have in the stirrup, if on horseback, or
on the infallibility of this remedy against the
annoyance of harvest bugs in September.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

They are rather scarce in England, whither

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The male bird is called mallard, and the
young ones flappers. To find a brood of
these, go, about July, and hunt the rushes
in the deepest and most retired parts of some
brook or trout stream; where, if you spring
the old duck, you may be pretty sure that the
brood is not far off. When once found flappers
are easily killed, as they attain their full
growth before their wings are fledged; and for
this reason, the sport is often more like hunting
water rats than shooting birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you leave the brood after having disturbed
them, the old bird will remove them to
another place long before the following day.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the flappers take wing they assume
the name of wild ducks. About the month of
August they repair to the corn fields, till disturbed
by the harvest people. They then frequent
the rivers pretty early in the evening,
and show excellent sport to any one who has
patience to wait for them. Our sporting writers
in general have given no further directions
for duck-shooting than to walk quietly up a
brook, and shoot them as they rise. In doing
this, if you have only a single gun, and should
spring a bird at an uncertain distance, halloo
out before you shoot, as there may be others
under a bank, and much closer to you, that
would spring on the discharge of your gun.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a duck gun is too large in the calibre, in
proportion to its weight of metal, it will recoil
considerably; and if too small, it will not
have the desired effect of allowing the shot
to lie compactly together.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gun fired from a rest is felt more than
if held out; because the left hand, when
grasping it, checks the recoil. The stock of
a heavy duck-gun should be more bent than
that of a common gun as, when we are holding
out a great weight, it is not so easy to
lower the head: and it should also be observed,
that the curve in the stock tends to lessen
the recoil.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have of late years had the duck gun
stocks, which I used on the coast, made with
a pistol grip, and whipped with waxed-end
round the handle, similar to a cricket-bat,
which rather lessens the jar; and the upper
part of the butt very much cut away, in order
to prevent it from hurting the shoulder-bone.
I also paint and varnish the stock, by which
means it does not get cracked, after being
wetted with salt-water. The gun-makers’
stocks I found were always a great plague on
this account, as well as from the trouble of
keeping them in order, after being exposed
to the spray of the sea. Add to which, they
recoil most unmercifully, and are, therefore,
only fit for light charges.</p>

<p class='c006'>The large guns were loaded with precisely
double the charge of the small gun, which is
one-fifth less than that with which they always
killed best.</p>

<p class='c006'>The paper was nailed up close to a sheet of
water, and two men placed to observe that
effect; which was, that the outside shot (that
which flew wide of the paper) appeared to be
driven with much more force from the heavy
guns, and, of course, spread a much larger
surface.</p>

<p class='c006'>This proves that although, if both accurately
levelled, the difference between a wild-fowl
gun and a small gun, is not so very considerable,
at a single bird; yet, from the immense
circle which the large gun spreads, you have
more chances of killing with an indifferent
aim; and, of course, in a flock (as before
said) would kill many more birds at a shot.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'><span class='xlarge'>E</span>agle</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird of prey. A name given to the larger species of the
Falcon family, differing in little but size from the true falcons.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_164.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>There seem to be three well ascertained
native species; the Golden Eagle, the Osprey,
and what we call Eagle, from its frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Golden Eagle (<i>Falco chrysætos</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le grand Aigle</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) is the largest of the
genus; it measures, from the point of the bill
to the extremity of the toes, upwards of three
feet; and in breadth, from wing to wing,
above eight; and weighs from sixteen to
eighteen pounds. The male is smaller, and
does not weigh more than twelve pounds.
The bill is of a deep blue colour; the cere
yellow; the eyes are large, deep, sunk, and
covered by a projecting brow; the iris is of a
fine bright yellow, and sparkles with uncommon
lustre. The general colour is deep
brown mixed with tawny on the head and
neck; the quills are chocolate, with white
shafts; the tail is black, spotted with ash-colour;
the legs are yellow, and feathered
down to the toes, which are very scaly; the
claws are remarkably large—the middle one
is two inches in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>This noble bird is found in various parts of
Europe; it abounds most in warmer regions,
and has seldom been met with farther north
than the fifty-fifth degree of latitude. It is
known to breed in the mountainous parts of
Ireland: it lays three and sometimes four
eggs, of which it seldom happens that more
than two are prolific. Mr. Pennant says there
are instances, though rare, of their having
bred in Snowdon Hills. Mr. Wallis, in his
Natural History of Northumberland, says—“it
formerly had its aërie on the highest and
steepest part of Cheviot. In the beginning
of January, 1735, a very large one was shot
near Warkworth, which measured, from point
to point of its wings, eleven feet and a quarter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Ring-tailed Eagle (<i>Falco fulvus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>l’Aigle commun</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) is the common
eagle of Buffon, and, according to that
author, includes two varieties, the brown and
the black eagle; they are both of the same
brown colour, distinguished only by a deeper
shade, and are nearly of the same size: in
both, the upper part of the head and neck is
mixed with rust colour, and the base of the
larger feathers marked with white; the bill
is of a dark horn colour; the cere of a light
yellow; the iris is hazel; and between the
bill and the eye there is a naked skin of a
dirty brown colour; the legs are feathered to
the toes, which are yellow, and the claws
black; the tail is distinguished by a white
ring, which covers about two-thirds of its
length; the remaining part is black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ring-tailed eagle is more numerous
and diffused than the golden eagle, and prefers
more northern climates. It is found in
France, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain,
and in America as far north as Hudson’s Bay.</p>

<p class='c006'>The White-tailed Eagle, Great Erne, or
Cinereous Eagle (<i>Falco albicilla</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le grand Pygargue</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) Of this there
appears to be three varieties, which differ
chiefly in size, and consist of the following:
the great erne, or cinereous eagle, of Latham
and Pennant; the small erne, or lesser white-tailed
eagle; and the white-headed erne, or
bald eagle. The first two are distinguished
by their size, and the last by the whiteness of
its head and neck. The white-tailed eagle is
inferior in size to the golden eagle. The
beak, cere, and eyes are of a pale yellow; the
space between the beak and the eye is of a
blueish colour, and thinly covered with hair;
the sides of the head and neck are of a pale
ash-colour, mixed with reddish brown; the
general colour of the plumage is brown,
darkest on the upper part of the head, neck,
and back; the quill feathers are very dark;
the breast is irregularly marked with white
spots; the tail is white; the legs, which are
of a bright yellow, are feathered a little
below the knees; the claws are black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird inhabits all the northern parts of
Europe, and is found in Scotland and many
parts of Great Britain. It is equal in strength
and vigour to the common eagle, but more
furious; and is said to drive its young ones
from the nest, after having fed them only a
very short time. It has commonly two or
three young, and builds its nest upon lofty
trees.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sea Eagle, (<i>Falco ossifragus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>L’Orfraie</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird is nearly as
large as the Golden Eagle, measuring, in
length, three feet and a half; but its expanded
wings do not reach above seven feet.
Its bill is large, much hooked, and of a blueish
colour; irides in some light hazel, in
others yellow: a row of strong bristly feathers
hangs down from under his bill next to his
throat, whence it has been termed the
Bearded Eagle: the top of the head and back
part of the neck are dark brown, inclining to
black; the feathers on the back are variegated
by a lighter brown, with dark edges; the
scapulars are pale brown, the edges nearly
white; the breast and belly whitish, with
irregular spots of brown; the tail feathers are
dark brown, the outer edges of the exterior
feathers whitish; the quill-feathers and thighs
are dusky; the legs and feet yellow; the
claws, which are large, and form a complete
semicircle, are of a shining black.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is found in various parts of Europe and
America. It is said to lay only two eggs
during the whole year, and frequently produces
only one young bird; it is, however,
widely dispersed, and was met with at Botany
Island by Captain Cook. It lives chiefly on
fish: its usual haunts are by the sea-shore;
it also frequents the borders of large lakes
and rivers; and is said to see so distinctly in
the dark, as to be able to pursue and catch
its prey during the night. The story of the
eagle, brought to the ground after a severe
conflict with a cat, which it had seized and
taken up into the air with its talons, is very
remarkable. Mr. Barlow, who was an eyewitness
of the fact, made a drawing of it,
which he afterwards engraved.</p>

<p class='c006'>In their native districts these noble birds
are generally seen near the sea-shore, or upon
the rocky precipices on the margin of the inland
lakes, from whence they pounce upon
the fish while swimming near the surface of
the water. Aquatic birds also become their
frequent prey. They generally choose the
most inaccessible cliffs for building their nests,
laying one and sometimes two eggs, entirely
white, and nearly the size of that of a goose;
one of these, in Selby’s possession, was laid
by a bird after it had been in confinement
twenty years.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Montagu, speaking of the cinereous or sea-eagle,
says, “The specimen from which this
description is taken, was killed by Sir Robert
Littleton’s game-keeper in Shropshire. It
was accompanied by a letter from Sir Robert,
the purport of which was, that his servant being
out shooting, saw two large birds feeding
on the carcase of a sheep, which appeared recently
killed; that having nothing but small
snipe-shot with him, he turned back, intending
to go home for larger; that the eagles
then followed him, and frequently came so
near, that he concluded they meant either to
attack him or his dogs. Suddenly losing sight
of one, he judged it was very near him behind,
and being somewhat alarmed, turned
and shot at it in a hurry; after which the
bird flew some hundred yards, and dropped.
On his approach it was vomiting blood; and
he killed it after a struggle of half an hour.”
He adds, that it was the larger of the two.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>John Maxwell, Esq., of Ardbraccan, in
Ireland, favoured us with two young birds of
this species alive, taken the preceding year on
a mountainous precipice, or craggy cliff, called
Slieve Donard, impending over the sea, in the
county of Down. That gentleman informed
us that two men, covered with sackcloth and
armed, were lowered by ropes to the aërie
which, with considerable difficulty, they robbed
of two young, leaving only one addled egg
behind. The old eagles being so furious as
to create serious alarm, neither the nest nor
colour of the egg were noticed. Some fragments
of flesh were in the nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eaglets were covered with a glossy,
dark, murry-coloured down. A basket was
attached to the ropes that conveyed the men
down: into this the young birds were put;
but from the violence and amazing strength of
the parent birds, they were with difficulty
carried off. These birds were not twelve
months old when we received them. On
their first moulting they became much darker,
particularly about the breast and thighs, the
latter almost wholly of a dusky black. At
two years old, the base of the bill became yellow;
in the third year there was not any material
change. At this time one of them
killed and devoured the other, probably from
some neglect in feeding them, as before that
event they lived together in perfect harmony.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>From the astonishing height these and
some other birds fly, we are led to believe that
they are capable of living in a much lighter
atmosphere than any other animals. From
the top of some of the highest mountains in
Scotland, we have seen several of them soaring
together at so great a distance as to appear
scarce larger than a swallow. It is said
to prey indiscriminately on land animals,
fish, and aquatic birds, and probably every
animal of inferior strength suffers from its rapacity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two of this species contending in the air
over Loch Lomond, in the Scottish Highlands,
became so firmly grappled to each
other by their talons, that they were precipitated
into the water. The uppermost regained
the power of its wings, but the other
was taken alive by a Highlander, who witnessed
the scene, and who waited till the
wind had wafted him near the shore. This
curious account was received from an officer
who bought the eagle.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Although this is an extremely bold bird, it
will not venture to contend with a dog or a
fox in its natural state. An eagle and a fox
were observed to be regaling themselves on
the carcase of a goat, that had fallen down a
precipice in the Highlands of Scotland. The
latter frequently obliged the other to desist,
and retreat a little, but it was not sufficiently
alarmed to prevent returning; and it occasionally
threw itself into bold and picturesque
attitudes of defence, spreading the wings and
tail, and erecting every feather.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Montagu says, “Two living eagles were
sent to us from Ireland, and were, on their
arrival at Bristol, detained by an officer of
excise, upon a plea that there was a duty upon
all singing-birds. Had this happened on the
other side of the water, it might have been
termed an Irish story. The unfortunate birds
would, however, have been starved at the
custom-house, if application had not been
made to the head of that department in the
port of Bristol, offering to pay any demand
for their release, if legally detained for their
vocal abilities. By this officer it was most
wisely determined, after some consideration,
that eagles could scarcely be considered as
singing-birds.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The eagles in the Isle of Rum have nearly
extirpated the stags that used to abound
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>They generally build in clefts of rocks
near the deer forests; and make great havoc
among them, the white hares, and the ptarmigans.
Willoughby gives the following curious
account of the nest of this species:—“In
1668, in the woodlands near the River
Derwent, in the peak of Derbyshire, was
found an eagle’s nest, made of great sticks,
resting one end on the edge of a rock, the
other on two birch trees; upon which was
a layer of rushes, and over them a layer of
heath, and upon the heath rushes again;
upon which lay one young one and an addled
egg; and by them a lamb, a hare, and three
heath poults. The nest was about two yards
square, and had no hollow in it.”—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Willoughby</i>—<i>Selby</i>—<i>Pennant.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ecarté</i> is played by two persons with a
pack of thirty-two cards, as at piquet. It is
customary to have two packs, and of different
colours for the sake of distinction. The pack
to be first dealt with is placed on the right
hand of the dealer, and the other at his left.
Though only two persons can play at the
same time, it is not unusual to admit one or
more into the game, the winner or loser, as
may be agreed, resigning his seat to the next
in rotation, and this is called <i>playing a fool</i>.
The game consists of five points, unless it be
otherwise agreed upon by the players.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF CUTTING FOR THE DEAL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. He who cuts the highest card is entitled
to the deal. In most games the lowest card
takes the deal, but it is the reverse at ecarté,
the deal being considered an advantage on
account of the king, of which we shall speak
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He who does not show the card he
cuts, is considered as having cut the lowest in
the pack.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. He who shows two cards in cutting is
considered as having cut the lowest of the
two.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The cut for the deal is good, even with
a defective pack.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. In playing a rubber, the deal goes on
regularly as at all other games.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The order of the cards is as follows:
king, queen, knave, ace, ten, nine, eight,
seven.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF THE DEAL, THE MISDEAL, AND THE TURN UP CARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. The person who gains the deal shuffles
the cards, presents them to his adversary to
cut, and then deals ten cards, five to his adversary
and five to himself. He distributes
them by three and two, or two and three, at
his option, beginning with his adversary, turns
up the eleventh card as the trump, and places
the remainder of the pack or stock, as it is
called, at his right hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The order of dealing observed at the
beginning of the game must be continued as
long as the game lasts. For instance, if the
dealer began with three and two, he cannot
change and give two and three; and <i>vice
versâ</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If there be one or more faced cards in
the pack, and it be discovered before either
hand has been seen, the deal is void, unless
it be the eleventh card, which, being the one
that is to be turned up, can effect no alteration
in the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. If it be not discovered till after the discard
has been put out, and the faced card or
cards come to the dealer, the deal is good,
and the faced card or cards must form a part
of his hand. If, on the contrary, a faced card
come to the elder hand, he may, at his option,
consider the deal good, or call a new deal;
for this reason, that the fault being committed
by the dealer, the elder hand ought not to
suffer for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. It sometimes happens, that the dealer
turns up one or more cards in dealing. If
they chance to be his own cards, the deal is
good, for the knowledge thus acquired by his
adversary, of one or more of the cards in his
hand, can be prejudicial only to himself, and
he ought to submit to the penalty of his fault:
if he turn his adversary’s card, the deal goes
on, but it is optional with the adversary to
allow it to stand, or to call a new one. Some
persons contend, that the moment a card is
seen there ought to be a new deal. This is
by no means a just rule. An unfair or not
strictly scrupulous player, who might know
some of the cards in the pack, might perhaps
purposely turn up a card or two in dealing, if
he found he was giving good cards to his adversary,
and would incur no penalty but the
trouble of dealing again.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When a player deals out of turn, and it
is discovered before the trump card is seen,
there must be a new deal: but if not discovered
till after the trump card is known, or
before the parties have discarded or played,
the pack, just as it is, is left for his next deal,
and the game proceeded in by the right person
dealing with the other pack: if the play
have commenced, or the discard been put out
before the discovery, the deal is good.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Should there be a misdeal, and it be
discovered before either party has seen his
hand, it may be made good by restoring the
cards to the order in which they would have
fallen had no misdeal been made.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. If the elder hand perceive that the
dealer has not given him as many cards as he
asked for, and the mistake be discovered
before the dealer has seen the cards he has
to take in, it may be rectified in the same
manner as in the preceding case.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. If the cards have been seen by both
parties, and the dealer should have a deficiency,
it is in the option of the adversary,
either to allow him to supply the deficiency,
from the uppermost cards of the stock, or
oblige him to lose the deal; if the dealer
should have a card too many, his adversary
has the option of drawing a card from his
hand by chance, or obliging him to lose the
deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. If the elder hand should have a deficiency,
it is optional with him to supply it
from the stock, or claim the deal; if he have
too many cards, he may either discard them,
or claim the deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. If however it can be proved, that the
fault did not originate with the dealer, as, for
instance, where the elder hand has asked for
three cards and has only discarded two, or
has asked but for two and discarded three,
then the elder hand shall lose one point, and
not be allowed to reckon the king.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. He who after having taken in his cards
for his discard, plays with more than five cards,
loses a point, and also the right of marking
the king.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. When the dealer turns up two or more
cards, instead of one for the trump, it is
optional with the adversary to claim what
would have been the turn-up card, if the
order had not been deranged, or to place the
cards seen at the bottom of the stock and
have a new cut, or to call a new deal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF THE KING, AND THE TURN UP OR TRUMP CARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. He who turns up a king gains and marks
one point: he who holds the king of the suit
turned up, gains and marks one point.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The king must be declared before it is
played, by the holder of it saying, I hold the
king: it may also be declared after it has been
played; but, in that case, it must be the leading
card, and not have been covered by the adversary’s
card; for if covered before declared,
the point cannot be marked.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. This rule applies only to the elder hand;
the second player must always declare the king
before he plays it; but it is his interest not to
declare it till after his adversary has played his
first card.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The suit of the turn up card, or trump,
is superior to all the other suits.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF DISCARDING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. If the elder-hand be dissatisfied with his
cards, he proposes to exchange them in whole
or in part, by saying, I discard, or I propose,
or if you please, or any other equivalent phrase.
If the second player be also dissatisfied with
his hand, he accedes to the proposal by saying,
How many? He then gives the elder hand as
many cards as he demands, and afterwards takes
as many as he wants himself to the full number
of the whole hand, five cards each, if requisite.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He who has once proposed cannot refuse
the cards given him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If after the first exchange the elder hand
be still not content with his cards, he may ask
for more three or four times successively, till
the thirty-two cards are exhausted, but the
dealer, from first to last, is always at liberty to
accept or refuse.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Each player before he takes in new cards,
must throw his discard on the table apart from
the stock, and the cards put out must all be
mixed together. The discard made, neither
player can demand more or less cards than he
requested, nor is he allowed to look at those
which have been discarded.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. It sometimes happens, that, after several
exchanges have been made, the elder hand
having proposed again, and the dealer having
inconsiderately asked, How many, there are not
cards enough left to satisfy his demand. In
this case he who has proposed is not the less
bound to have other cards; but as he cannot
have them from the stock, there being no stock
left, he is obliged to supply the deficiency from
his last discard.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. He who looks at his discard, after he has
made it, is obliged to play with his hand exposed
on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. When, after the first deal, the elder hand
proposes, and the other refuses, the one who
refuses loses two points, if he do not make
three tricks.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. In the same manner when the elder hand
plays without proposing, he loses two points, if
he do not win three tricks.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. If, in giving new cards to the proposer,
the dealer turn up a card for the trump, in
mistake as at the original deal, he cannot refuse
a second discard, should his adversary demand
it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF THE MANNER OF PLAYING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. The elder hand plays first.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The first player is bound to play in the
suit he names; for instance, if he should say
hearts, and play clubs, or any other suit, he is
obliged, if his adversary insist on it, to take up
the card he has played, and to play in the
declared suit.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If the adversary deem the card played
more advantageous to his own hand than the
declared suit, he plays to it, and the card once
covered cannot be recalled in order to play a
different suit.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. He who plays before his turn is only
obliged to take up his card again, if it have not
been played to; but if it be covered, the trick
is good. In this case, as in the preceding one,
both players having been in fault, one for having
played and the other for having allowed
him to play out of turn, no penalty is incurred.</p>

    <div>OF THE SCORE AND VOLE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. When both parties have done discarding,
he who wins three tricks reckons one point;
if he win every trick he reckons two points,
and has won the vole.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Two points only can be made in the same
deal, unless you hold the king. To make two
points without the king or three with the king,
is called winning the vole.</p>

    <div>OF THE REVOKE AND UNDER-FORCE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. It is not allowable to revoke, or to under-force.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When one of the players has revoked or
under-forced, as soon as it is discovered the
cards are taken up and played over again; but
the person in fault, if he win the vole, counts
only one point for it, and nothing if he win the
point only.</p>

    <div>GENERAL RULES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. For the cut to be good, at this as at every
other game, two cards, at least, must be left
of the pack.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Each player has a right to ask for new
cards as often as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When a player takes tricks that do not
belong to him, and reckons them as his own,
a bystander has a right to mention it; and so
as to any other unfair play.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. He who, under whatever pretence, looks
at his adversary’s tricks, is bound to play out
the hand with his cards exposed on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. A card escaping from a hand, and falling
under the table, is not considered as played,
unless it has been played to, or has covered,
wholly or in part, the adversary’s card.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. If a player from mistake or ill humour
should throw down and mix his cards, the adversary
scores two points.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. He who quits the game loses it; but
should there be bets depending, the adversary
is bound to continue the game with some one
of the bystanders, for the benefit of the persons
so interested.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. When the pack is defective, by consisting
of too many, or too few cards; the deal in
which it is discovered is void, but the preceding
ones stand good.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>OF BETTING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. He who bets on one of the players has a
right to advise him in playing the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He who wins a bet is bound to give his
adversary his revenge, but the loser is not
obliged to take it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The players have the privilege of accepting
bets in preference to a bystander.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Betting being optional and not arbitrary,
the bets that are made must be mentioned at
every game.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Every case not provided for by the foregoing
rules ought always to be decided against
the player who is in fault.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Eel</span>, <i>s.</i> A serpentine slimy fish, that lurks in mud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very little is yet known of the natural history
of the eel; indeed, the element in which
they live almost precludes us from that access
to them which is necessary to enable us
to observe their habits and economy. The
eel is evidently a link between the fish and
serpent, but, unlike the former, it can exist a
long time out of water, which its nocturnal
migrations prove, though probably a certain
degree of moisture on the grass is necessary
to enable it to do this.</p>

<p class='c006'>The haunts of the eel are among weeds,
under roots, stumps of trees, in holes and
clefts of the earth, both in the banks, and
at the bottom in the plain mud, where they
lie with only their heads out, watching for
their prey; they are also to be found under
great stones, old timber, about bridges, flood-gates,
weirs, and also mills, except when the
water is rendered thick by rains, for then they
come out, and will bite eagerly. They are in
best season from May until July: a running
line should be used, which must be very
strong, and the hook No. 3, or 4, with a plumb
or pistol bullet upon it. They are to be angled
for on the ground, and two or more rods
may be employed (if ground bait be thought
necessary, it should be the same as for the
barbel); the prime bait is the lob-worm, and
they bite eagerly all day, in dark cloudy weather,
after showers, attended with thunder
and lightning, when the water is high and discoloured;
but those who venture upon night
angling, will have far greater success when the
weather is warm and the night dark. They are
then to be angled for upon the shallows,
where there is a current, or by the side or tail
of a stream, with a sandy or gravelly bottom,
with the bait on the ground; they will be
felt to tug sharply when they seize the bait,
give time (which is necessary both in day and
night angling), and there will be no doubt of
sport from night-fall until day-break, when
they directly flee to their hiding places.</p>

<p class='c006'>The largest eels are caught by night lines.
It is of little consequence where they are laid,
as they will succeed in streams (where the
eels rove in search of prey), as well as in
still waters, and they will take frogs, black
snails, worms, roach, dace, gudgeon, minnows
(which two last are best), loaches, bleaks, and
millers’ thumbs. A sufficient quantity of links
of twelve hairs should be doubled, and a hook
tied to each link; these are to be noosed at
proper distances to pieces of cord of fifteen
feet long; bait the hooks by making an incision
with the baiting needle under the shoulder
and thrusting it out at the middle of the tail,
drawing the link after it; the point of the
hook should be upright towards the back of
the baitfish; fasten one end to the bank or a
stub, and cast the other into the water, but not
to the extent of the line (as eels will run a little
before they gorge): the lines should be taken
up early in the morning; such of the lines
as have eels at them will be drawn very tight.
Dark nights in July, August, and September,
are the best for this kind of fishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another method of taking eels, when the
water is clear and low, is called snigling, and
is performed with a stick about a yard long,
with a cleft at each end, and a strong needle
well whipped to a small whipcord line from
the eye down to the middle. In baiting, run
the head of the needle quite up into the head
of a lobworm, letting the point come about
the middle; then put the point of the needle
into the cleft at either end of the stick, and
taking both stick and line together in one
hand, put the bait softly into holes under
walls, stones, &amp;c., where eels hide themselves;
if there be an eel there, he will take the
worm and needle out of the cleft. Draw back
the stick gently (having slackened the line),
and give time for his swallowing the bait; then
strike, and the needle will stick across his
throat. Let him tire himself with tugging,
previous to any attempt to pull him out, for
he lies folded in his den, and will fasten his
tail round anything for his defence. The
largest eels are generally taken about the hollow
stone-work of old bridges (the angler
being in a boat), and are sometimes caught in
considerable numbers.</p>

<p class='c006'>A third plan for taking eels is by what is
termed bobbing, which is best managed in a
boat. This is done by taking a quantity of
well-scoured lobworms; have a long needle,
with three lengths of worsted slightly twisted
together; put the needle lengthways through
the worms, and draw them down on the worsted.
When there is two yards thus prepared,
then fold them up in links, and tie them to
about two yards of good twine, and make a
knot on it eight inches from the worms; and
slipping a piece of lead, with a hole in it
(weighing from a quarter to three quarters of
a pound, according to the current fished in),
down the line to the knot; fasten the line to
a manageable pole, and let the lead lie on the
bottom in thick, muddy water, when the tide
runs up strong, or near the mouth of some
river. When the eels nibble at the bait, they
can be felt; give some little time before it is
pulled up, which must be gently until near
the surface, and then hoist out quickly. The
worsted sticking in the eels’ teeth, prevents
their loosening themselves until the line is
slackened by throwing them into the boat, or
on the ground. So soon as they are disentangled,
throw the bait in again. Frequently
great quantities are thus caught, especially of
grigs. Eels are also to be snared in the same
way as the pike, and in the fens numbers are
speared by an instrument with three or four
forks, or jagged teeth, which is struck at random
into the mud.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The most extraordinary peculiarity in the
natural history of the eel, is its double migration,
one up and one down rivers, one
from and the other to the sea; the first in
spring and summer, and the second in autumn
or early in winter. The first, of very small
eels, which are sometimes not more than two
or two and a half inches long; the second, of
large eels, which sometimes are three or four
feet long, and weigh from ten to fifteen, or
even twenty pounds. There is great reason
to believe, that all eels found in fresh water
are the results of the first migration. They
appear in millions, in April and May, and
sometimes continue to rise as late even as
July and the beginning of August. I remember
this was the case in Ireland, in 1823. It
had been a cold backward summer, and when
I was at Ballyshannon, about the end of July,
the mouth of the river, which had been in
flood all this month, under the fall, was
blackened by millions of little eels, about as
long as the finger, which were constantly
urging their way up the moist rocks by the
side of the fall. Thousands died, but their
bodies remaining moist, served as the ladder
for others to make their way; and I saw some
ascending even perpendicular stones, making
their road through wet moss, or adhering to
some eels that had died in the attempt.
Such is the energy of these little animals,
that they continue to find their way, in immense
numbers, to Loch Erne. The same
thing happens at the fall of the Bann, and
Loch Neagh is thus peopled by them: even
the mighty Fall of Schaffhausen does not prevent
them from making their way to the
Lake of Constance, where I have seen many
very large eels.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are eels in the Lake of Neufchatel,
which communicates, by a stream, with the
Rhine; but there are none in the Leman
Lake, because the Rhone makes a subterraneous
fall below Geneva; and though small
eels can pass by moss or mount rocks, they
cannot penetrate limestone, or move against
a rapid descending course of water, passing,
as it were, through a pipe. Again: no eels
mount the Danube from the Black Sea; and
there are none found in the great extent of
lakes, swamps, and rivers, communicating
with the Danube, though some of these lakes
and morasses are wonderfully fitted for them,
and though they are found abundantly in the
same countries, in lakes and rivers connected
with the ocean and Mediterranean. Yet,
when brought into confined water in the
Danube, they fatten and thrive there. As
to the instinct which leads young eels to seek
fresh water, it is difficult to reason; probably
they prefer warmth, and, swimming at the
surface in the early summer, find the lighter
water warmer, and likewise containing more
insects, and so pursue the courses of fresh
water, as the waters from the land, at this
season, become warmer than those of the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. J. Couch, (<i>Lin. Trans.</i> t. xiv. p. 70)
says, that the little eels, according to his observation,
are produced within reach of the tide,
and climb round falls to reach fresh water from
the sea. I have sometimes seen them, in
spring, swimming in immense shoals in the
Atlantic, in Mount Bay, making their way to
the mouth of small brooks and rivers. When
the cold water from the autumnal floods begins
to swell the rivers, this fish tries to return to
the sea; but numbers of the smaller ones hide
themselves during the winter in the mud, and
many of them form, as it were, in masses together.
Various authors have recorded the
migration of eels in a singular way,—such as
Dr. Plot, who, in his History of Staffordshire,
says, that they pass in the night, across meadows,
from one pond to another: and Mr.
Arderon, (in <i>Trans. Royal Soc.</i>) gives a distinct
account of small eels rising up the flood-gates
and posts of the water works of the city
of Norwich; and they made their way to the
water above, though the boards were smooth
planed, and five or six feet perpendicular. He
says, when they first rose out of the water upon
the dry board, they rested a little—which
seemed to be till their slime was thrown out,
and sufficiently glutinous—and then they rose
up the perpendicular ascent with the same facility
as if they had been moving on a plane
surface.—(<i>Trans. Abr.</i> vol. ix. p. 311.) There
can, I think, be no doubt, that they are assisted
by their small scales, which, placed like those
of serpents, must facilitate their progressive
motion: these scales have been microscopically
observed by Leuwenhoek.—(<i>Phil. Trans.</i> vol.
iv.) Eels migrate from the salt-water of different
sizes, but I believe never when they are
above a foot long—and the great mass of them
are only from two and a half to four inches.
They feed, grow, and fatten in fresh water. In
small rivers they are seldom very large; but
in large deep lakes they become as thick as a
man’s arm, or even leg; and all those of a considerable
size attempt to run to the sea in October
or November, probably when they experience
the cold of the first autumnal rains.
Those that are not of the largest size, as I said
before, pass the winter in the deepest parts of
the mud of rivers and lakes, and do not seem
to eat much, and remain, I believe, almost
torpid. Their increase is not certainly known
in any given time, but must depend upon the
quantity of their food; but it is probable they
do not become of the largest size from the
smallest in one or even two seasons: but this,
as well as many other particulars, can only be
ascertained by new observations and experiments.
Block states, that they grow slowly,
and mentions, that some had been kept in the
same pond for fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c006'>As very large eels, after having migrated,
never return to the river again, they must
(for it cannot be supposed they all die immediately
in the sea) remain in salt water; and
there is great probability, that they are then
confounded with the conger, which is found
of different colours and sizes, from the smallest
to the largest, from a few ounces to one
hundred pounds in weight. The colour of
the conger is generally paler than that of the
eel; but, in the Atlantic, it is said, that pale
congers are found on one side of the Wolf
Rock, and dark ones on the other. The
conger has breathing tubes, which are said not
to be found in the other eel; but to determine
this, would require a more minute examination
than has yet been made. Both the
conger and common eel have fringes along the
air-bladder, which are probably the ovaria;
and Sir E. Home thinks them hermaphrodite,
and that the seminal vessels are close to the
kidneys. I hope this great comparative anatomist
will be able to confirm his views by
new dissections, and some chemical researches
upon the nature of the fringes and the supposed
melt. If viviparous, and the fringes
contain the ova, one mother must produce
tens of thousands, the ova being remarkably
small; but it appears more probable, that they
are oviparous, and that they deposit their ova
in parts of the sea near deep basins, which
remain warm in winter. This might be ascertained
by experiment, particularly on the
coast of the Mediterranean. I cannot find
that they haunt the Arctic Ocean, which is
probably of too low a temperature to suit their
feelings or habits; and the Caspian and Black
Sea are probably without them, from their not
being found in the Volga or Danube; these
being shallow seas, are perhaps too cold for
them in winter. From the time (April) that
small eels begin to migrate, it is probable that
they are generated in winter, and the pregnant
eels should be looked for in November,
December, and January. I opened one in
December, in which the fringes were abundant,
but I did not examine them under the microscope,
or chemically. I trust this curious
problem will not remain much longer unsolved.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>An amazing number of eels are bred in the
two large ponds in Richmond Park, which is
sufficiently evident from the very great quantity
of young ones which migrate from those
ponds every year. The late respectable head-keeper
of that park assured me, that, at
nearly the same day in the month of May, vast
numbers of young eels, about two inches in
length, contrived to get through the pen-stock
of the upper pond, and then through the channel
which led into the lower pond, from whence
they got through another pen-stock into a
water-course which led them eventually into
the River Thames. They migrated in one
connected shoal, and in such prodigious numbers,
that no guess could be given as to their
probable amount.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The winter retreat of eels is very curious.
They not only get deep into the mud, but in
Bushy Park, where the mud in the ponds is
not very deep, and what there is is of a sandy
nature, the eels make their way under the
banks of the ponds, and have been found
knotted together in a large mass.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Eel-weirs are common in almost all the
rivers in Ireland. There are some large ones
at, or near Enniskillen, where great quantities
of these fish are caught; they are not natives
of the lake, but come from the sea when very
young, and are intercepted in their return; they
never take a bait, nor are ever known to eat
any kind of food. Lord Belmore has kept
some in boxes for a year, and found this to be
the case.</p>

<p class='c006'>The country people catch them by extending
across the water a band of hay, in which
the eels get so entangled, as not to be able to
disengage themselves, and by these means are
easily taken.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There is a very singular eel found in the river
Barrow near Carlow. It is like the gillaroo,
has a gizzard. This eel is said to be particularly
delicious when introduced to table.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The common eel will grow to a large size,
sometimes to weigh twenty pounds, but that is
extremely rare; in 1799 one was taken out of
the Kennet, near Newbury, which weighed
fifteen pounds. As to instances brought by
Dale and others, of these fish increasing to a
superior magnitude, there is much reason to
suspect them to have been congers; since the
enormous eels they describe, have all been taken
at the mouth of the Thames or Medway.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following curious fact is recorded by
Mr. Swallow, some years since the British
Consul-General in Russia:—Having occasion
to go from Petersburgh to Moscow, where
eels are a great rarity, he ordered some, to
carry as a present; upon being taken out of
the water, they were thrown upon the ground
to be frozen, and soon appeared quite dead,
and almost a piece of ice; they were then
packed in snow, and when arrived at Moscow,
which was four days after, the eels being put
into cold water, and so thawed, discovered
gradually signs of life, and soon perfectly recovered!</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The eel was anciently said to possess the
power of enforcing sobriety upon the most
devoted subject of the jolly god. “If you
would some notorious drunkard and common
swil-bowle to loth and abhorre his beastlie
vice, and for ever after to hate the drinking
of wine, put an eele alyue into some wyde
mouthed potte with a couer, hauing in it suche
a quantitie of wine as may suffice of itselfe
to suffocate and strangle the eele to death;
which doone, take out the dead eele, and let
the partie, whom you would have reclaymed
from his bibacitie, not knowing hereof, drinke
of that wine onely, euen as much as he listeth.”—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Sir

<p class='c006'><i>Eggs of Birds.</i>—By experiment it appears
that birds do not instinctively know the necessary
time of incubation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who suppose a bird capable of producing
eggs at will, or that any bird is excited
to lay more eggs than usual by daily robbing
their nest, are certainly mistaken. In a domesticated
fowl it is probable the desire of incubation
may be prolonged by leaving little or
nothing in the nest to sit on. It will therefore
lay the number allotted by nature, which
is determined before the first egg is produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is but few birds, if any, that would produce
a second lot of eggs in the same season
if unmolested; but if their nests are destroyed,
it is probable three or four separate lots may
be produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>The growth of an egg after impregnation is
exceedingly rapid; the yolk only is formed in
the <i>ovarium</i>, where it remains till within
twenty-four hours of its being produced; when
that part is fully matured, it separates and
falls down the <i>oviduct</i> into the <i>uterus</i>, where
the egg is perfectly formed; first, the <i>vitellus</i>
or yolk is surrounded by the <i>albumen</i> or
white; and lastly is covered with a calcareous
shell. The very expeditious growth of these
last appear to be an extraordinary exertion of
nature. The calcareous covering of an egg is
concreted and formed in a most expeditious
manner; a few hours only seem necessary
for this work. Only one <i>vitellus</i> separates
from the <i>ovarium</i> at a time, (except as we
shall hereafter mention,) till the exclusion of
which no other succeeds. But this is a daily
production, with few exceptions, there is no
more time allowed for perfecting the <i>albumen</i>
and shell than twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Colours of Eggs.</i>—It was a notion of
Darwin’s that the variety in the colours of
eggs, as well as in the colours of many animals,
is adapted to the purposes of concealment
from their natural enemies. Thus, he
remarks, that the eggs of the hedge-chanter
(<i>Accentor modularis</i>) are greenish blue, as
are those of magpies and crows, which are
seen from beneath in wicker nests, between
the eye and the blue of the firmament.
M. Glöger, a German naturalist, has followed
up this singular theory into some detail, and
considers it to be a remarkable provision of
nature, that birds whose nests are most exposed,
and whose eggs are most open to the
view of their enemies, lay eggs of which the
colour is the least distinguishable from that
of surrounding objects, so as to deceive the
eye of birds, or other plundering animals;
while birds, the eggs of which have a bright
decided colour, and are consequently very
conspicuous, either conceal their nests in
hollows, or only quit their eggs during the
night, or begin to sit immediately. It is also
to be remarked that in the species of which
the nest is open, and the female brings up the
brood without the assistance of the male,
these females are generally of a different
colour from the male, less conspicuous, and
more in harmony with the objects around.</p>

are the soft, silky, flowing plumes on the
head, breast, and shoulders: they consist of
single slender shafts, thinly set with pairs of
fine soft threads, which float on the slightest
breath of air. Those which arise from the
shoulders are extended over the back, and
flow beyond the tail. These plumes were
formerly used to decorate the helmets of
warriors: they are now applied to a gentler
and better purpose, in ornamenting the headdresses
of the European ladies, and the turbans
of the Persians and Turks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The egret seldom exceeds a pound and a
half in weight, and rarely a foot and a half in
length. A bare green skin is extended from
the beak to the eyes, the irides of which are
pale yellow: the bill and legs are black.
Like the common heron, they perch and
build their nests on trees, and live on the
same kinds of food.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is found in almost every temperate
and warm climate, and must formerly
have been plentiful in Great Britain, if it be
the same bird as that mentioned by Leland in
the list or bill-of-fare prepared for the famous
feast of Archbishop Nevil, in which one thousand
of these birds were served up. No
wonder the species has become nearly extinct
in this country.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This wild but valuable species is of a size
between the goose and the domestic duck, and
appears to be one of the graduated links of the
chain which connects the two kinds. The full-grown
old males generally measure about two
feet two inches in length, and two feet eight
in breadth, and weigh from six to above seven
pounds. The head is large; the middle of the
neck small, with the lower part of it spread
out very broad, so as to form a hollow between
the shoulders, which while the bird is sitting
at ease, seems as if fitted to receive its reclining
head. The bill is of a dirty yellowish horn
colour, darkish in the middle, and measures,
from the tip to the corners of the mouth, two
inches and a half: the upper mandible is forked
in a singular manner towards each eye, and is
covered with white feathers on the sides, as far
forward as the nostrils. The upper part of the
head is of a soft velvet black, divided behind
by a dull white stroke pointing downwards: the
feathers from the nape of the neck to the throat,
are long, or puffed out, overhanging the upper
part of the neck, and look as if they had been
clipped off at the lower ends; they have the
appearance of pale pea-green velvet shag, with
a white line dropping downward from the auriculars
on each side. The cheeks, chin, upper
part of the neck, back, and lesser wing
coverts, are white; the scapulars, and secondary
quills, next the body, dirty white: bastard
wings, and primary quills, brown; the
secondaries and greater coverts are the same,
but much darker: the lower broad part of the
neck, on the front, to the breast, is of a buff
colour; but in some specimens tinged with
rusty red: the breast, belly, vent, rump, and
tail coverts, are of a deep sooty black: tail
feathers hoary brown: legs short and yellow:
webs and nails dusky. The female is nearly
of the same shape, though less than the male,
weighing only between five and six pounds;
but her plumage is quite different, the ground
colour being of a reddish brown, prettily crossed
with waved black lines: and in some specimens
the neck, breast, and belly, are tinged
with ash: the wings are crossed with two bars
of white: quills dark: the neck is marked with
longitudinal dusky streaks, and the belly is
deep brown, spotted obscurely with black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eider duck lays from three to five large,
smooth, pale olive-coloured eggs; these she
deposits and conceals in a nest, or bed, made
of a great quantity of the soft, warm elastic
down, plucked from her own breast, and sometimes
from that of her mate. The groundwork
or foundation of the nest is formed of
bent grass, sea weeds, or such like coarse materials,
and it is placed in as sheltered a spot
as the bleak and solitary place can afford.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen, Lapland,
and some parts of the coast of Norway,
the eiders flock together, in particular breeding
places, in such numbers, and their nests
are so close together, that a person in walking
along can hardly avoid treading upon them.
The natives of these cold climates eagerly
watch the time when the first hatchings of the
eggs are laid: of these they rob the nest, and
also of the more important article, the down
with which it is lined, which they carefully
gather and carry off. These birds will afterwards
strip themselves of their remaining down,
and lay a second hatching, of which also they
are sometimes robbed; but, it is said, that when
this cruel treatment is too often repeated,
they leave the place, and return to it no
more.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eider birds build their nests on little
islands, not far from the shore, and sometimes
even near the dwellings of the natives, who
treat them with such kindness and circumspection
as to make them quite tame. In the
beginning of June they lay five or six eggs, and
it is not unusual to find from ten to sixteen
eggs in one nest, with two females, who agree
remarkably well together. The whole time
of laying continues six or seven weeks, during
which time the natives visit the nest, for the
purpose of taking the down and eggs, at least
once a week. They first carefully remove the
female, and then take away the down and
part of the eggs; after which she lays afresh,
covering her eggs with new down plucked from
her breast; this being taken away, the male
comes to her assistance, and covers the eggs
with his down, which is left till the young are
hatched. One female, during the whole time
of laying, generally gives half a pound of
down. The down from the dead birds is accounted
of little worth, having lost its elasticity.
There are generally exported fifteen
hundred or two thousand pounds of down on
the company’s account, exclusive of what is
privately sold.—The young ones quit the
nest soon after they are hatched, and follow
the female, who leads them to the water,
where, having taken them on her back, she
swims with them a few yards, and then dives,
and leaves them floating on the water: in this
situation they soon learn to take care of themselves,
and are seldom afterwards seen on the
land, but live among the rocks, and feed on
insects and sea-weed.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>“In my way hither,” says Major C., “I
measured the flight of the eider ducks by the
following method; viz., on arriving off Duck
Island, six miles distant from Henly Tickle,
I caused the people to lay on their oars; and
when I saw the flash of the guns, which were
fired at a flock of ducks as they passed through
the latter, I observed by my watch how long
they were in flying abreast of us. The result
of very many observations, ascertained the
rate of their flight to be ninety miles in an
hour.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The extraordinary elasticity of the down
appears from what I have already said of three
quarters of an ounce filling a large hat; and
Pontoppidan says, that two or three pounds of
it, though pressed into a ball, which may be
held in the hand, upon being allowed to expand,
will fill the foot-covering of a large bed.
It is worthy of notice, however, that it is only
the down taken from the nests which has this
great elasticity, for what is taken from the
dead birds is much inferior, being, as Pontoppidan
says, “fat, subject to rot, and far from
as light as what the female plucks to form a
bed for its young.” It is on this account that
it is prohibited by the laws of Norway to kill
the eiders for their down.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young have been taken from the Farn
Islands, in hopes of their becoming domesticated,
but all attempts have proved ineffectual;
probably for want of proper food, which is
said principally to consist of shell-fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The native regions of this bird extend from
45° north, to the highest latitudes yet discovered,
both in Europe and America; some
wandering pairs have been known to breed on
the rocky islands beyond Portland, in the
district of Mayne, which is, perhaps, the
most southern extent of their breeding place.
Greenland and Iceland abound with them,
and they are numerous on the coast of Labrador.
They associate together in flocks, generally
in deep water, diving for shell-fish, retiring
frequently to the rocky shore to rest
themselves, particularly on the approach of a
storm. Their flesh is much esteemed by the
inhabitants of Greenland, but tastes strongly
of fish. Wilson says, that several attempts
have been made to domesticate them, but
hitherto without effect.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Von Troil</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Embrocations of a more stimulating kind

of inflammation, proportionate to the

of the injured part; therefore they require, at
first, such treatment as is calculated to subdue
inflammation, that is, bleeding and purging
with a suitable diet, and in strains, rest.
The local or topical remedies in the inflammatory
stage, are poultices, but in these cases
bleeding and purging, immediately after their
occurrence, are an essential part of the treatment.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>To enter hounds.</i>—The first thing to be
attended to in young dogs of all kinds is to
make them understand their name well, and
answer to it, before training; for which they
should be rewarded and caressed. After foxhounds
have learned to follow freely, they
should be coupled, and led out among sheep,
deer, &amp;c., and made to understand that such
is not their game; but two dogs should never
be coupled together, as they are sure to
quarrel. A few at a time should be let loose
amongst sheep, and if they attempt to run after
them, should be severely chastised, and the
cry of <i>ware sheep</i> be often repeated to them;
which cry will, generally, on future occasions,
have the effect of stopping them from sheep-running,
without the necessity of using the
whip. Great care is necessary at the offset
to prevent them from worrying a sheep, which
they will sometimes do under the management
of careless trainers; for if they be allowed to
taste the blood, it will be very difficult afterwards
to break them from this bad habit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Young hounds should be often walked
about the courts of the kennel, followed by
the whipper in, who should rate them after
the huntsman. They should also be frequently
taken out with people on foot, which
teaches them to be more tractable and attentive,
and much more manageable. It is better
to take them out to their walks in a country
where they are to be hunted, as the sooner
they acquire a knowledge of it the better;
and when they are thrown out, or left behind,
are more likely to find their way home.</p>

<p class='c006'>In entering fox-hounds it should always be
at their own game; although some are foolish
enough to begin them with hares, which
just requires a second training to break them
from that pursuit. Nothing is so good for
rendering young hounds obedient as walking
them frequently out amongst sheep, hares,
and deer, and restraining their pursuit of
these animals. This probation will teach
them to be steady. A fox-cub should then
be turned out before them, in the company
of some old hounds as leaders, which train
them in a short time instinctively, as it were,
to hunt themselves. After they have tasted
blood, it will be more difficult to repress their
ardour than to excite it. Every means of
encouraging them should be used in the earlier
stages of their training, and punishment
only administered after they have made some
progress. In flogging a hound for a fault, the
whipper-in should use his voice at the same
time; this teaches him to know for what he is
beaten; and Mr. Daniel suggests the propriety
of introducing a live hare into the
kennel, and to flog the dogs soundly whenever
they attempt to approach her.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To enter Hawks.</i>—While the hawk is
<i>waiting on</i> at a proper height, his head being
turned inwards, a partridge tied to a creance
is to be thrown up; and when the hawk has
taken it, he must be allowed to eat it on the
ground near the falconer, who is to walk round
him, and whistle to him as usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this lesson has been repeated three
or four times, by throwing up partridges not
confined by the creance, the education of the
eyess may be considered as completed; and
he may be taken into the field to be used in
the way that I shall endeavour to describe;
but it will be necessary to give him every advantage
in his first flights, and to have a live
partridge in the bag, ready to be thrown up to
him, should he fail in his first attempts to
take his game.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have now described the mode of breaking
eyesses, as practised by the falconers; but I
am of opinion that it might be better done,
and with infinitely less trouble, by using the
young hawk, when flying at hack, to feed always
on the lure.</p>

<p class='c006'>He would soon learn to fly to it, when
swung round in the air, and would thus be
taught to wait on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The falconer should kneel down to the
hawk, when he is feeding on the lure, and
give him meat from the hand, by which means
he may not only be made tame, but may be
prevented from carrying.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the season for hawking is at hand,
a few live partridges should be thrown up to
him, and he should be allowed to eat them
near the falconer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have no doubt but by this treatment a
young hawk would be fit for use as soon as
he was taken up, and that nothing more would
be required than to accustom him to <i>stand to
the hood</i>.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

money according to his inclination. The interior

twenty of which are marked with the

O. The lodging of the ball in any of the

the wager. The proprietors of the

take all bets offered either for E or O; but if
the ball fall into either of the bar holes, they
win all the bets upon the opposite letter, and
do not pay to that in which it falls; an
advantage in the proportion of two to forty,

<p class='c006'>This liniment may be made stronger by
substituting nitrous acid for muriatic, or by
retaining the muriatic, and substituting for the

liniment is made, and a very useful one, by
using two ounces of vinegar instead of the muriatic
acid. (See <span class='sc'>Egyptiacum</span>). Escharotics

<p>THE FALCON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is recorded, that a falcon belonging to a
Duke of Cleves, flew out of Westphalia into
Prussia in one day; and in the county of
Norfolk, a hawk has made a flight at a woodcock
near thirty miles in an hour.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what are these compared to the actual
velocity and continuance of the flight of a
falcon, that is recorded to have belonged to
Henry IV., King of France, which escaped
from Fontainbleau, and in twenty-four hours
after was found in Malta, a space computed
to be not less than 1350 miles? a velocity
equal to fifty-seven miles an hour, supposing
the hawk to have been on wing the whole
time. But as such birds never fly by night,
and allowing the day to be at the longest, or
to be eighteen hours light, this would make
seventy-five miles an hour. It is probable,
however, that he neither had so many hours
of light in the twenty-four to perform the
journey, nor that he was retaken the moment
of his arrival, so that we may fairly conclude
much less time was occupied in performing
that distant flight.—<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Flight of Birds</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Falconer</span>, <i>s.</i> One who breeds and trains hawks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The village of Falconswaerd, near Bois le
Duc, in Holland, has for many years furnished
falconers to the rest of Europe. I have known
many falconers in England, and in the service
of different princes on the Continent, but
I never met with one of them who was not a
native of Falconswaerd.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been the practice of these sober and
industrious men to stay with their employers
during the season for hawking, and to pass
the remainder of the year with their families
at home.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A falconer, whose province it was to tame,
manage, and look after falcons and other
hawks, was formerly as great and conspicuous
a character as the most celebrated huntsman
of the present day. The influence of
fashion and the changes wrought by time have,
however, so obscured both sport and sportsmen
in this way, that neither hawk, falcon, or
falconer, are to be seen or heard of, unless in
the northern parts of the kingdom, where it
is also nearly buried in oblivion.—<i>Sebright</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fallow</span>, <i>a.</i> Pale red, or pale yellow; unsowed, left to rest after the years

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fallow Deer</span>, <i>s.</i> The domestic or park deer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_182.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>No two animals can make a more near
approach to each other than the stag and the
fallow deer, and yet no two animals keep
more distinct, or avoid each other with more
fixed animosity; they never herd or intermix
together, and consequently never give
rise to an intermediate race. It is even rare,
unless they have been transported thither, to
find fallow-deer in a country where stags are
numerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fallow-deer is easily tamed, and feeds
upon many things which the stag refuses; he
also preserves his venison better: nor does it
appear that the rutting, followed by a long and
severe winter, exhausts him, but he continues
nearly in the same state throughout the year.
He browses closer than the stag, for which
reason he is more prejudicial to young trees,
and often strips them too close for recovery.
The young deer eat faster and with more
avidity than the old. At the second year
they seek the female, and, like the stag, are
fond of variety. The doe goes with young
eight months and some days; she commonly
produces one fawn, sometimes two, but very
rarely three. They are capable of engendering,
from the age of two years to that of
fifteen or sixteen; and in short they resemble
the stag in all his natural habits, and the
greatest difference between them is the duration
of their lives. From the testimony of
hunters it has been remarked, that stags live
to the age of thirty-five or forty years, and
from the same authority we understand that
the fallow-deer does not live more than
twenty. As they are smaller than the stag,
it is probable that their growth is sooner
completed.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If some curious gentleman would procure
the head of a fallow-deer, and have it dissected,
he would find it furnished with two
spiracula, or breathing places, besides the nostrils;
probably analogous to the <i>puncta lachrymalia</i>
in the human head. When deer
are thirsty they plunge their noses, like some
horses, very deep under water while in the
act of drinking, and continue them in that
situation for a considerable time; but, to obviate
any inconveniency, they can open two
vents, one at the inner corner of each eye,
having a communication with the nose. Here
seems to be an extraordinary provision of nature
worthy our attention; and which has not,
that I know of, been noticed by any naturalist.
For it looks as if these creatures would not
be suffocated, though both their mouths and
nostrils were stopped. This curious formation
of the head may be of singular service to
beasts of chase, by affording them free respiration:
and no doubt these additional nostrils
are thrown open when they are hard run.—<i>Buffon</i>—<i>White’s

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>False Quarter</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>False Quarter</i> is a defect in the hoof of a

producing a destruction of parts, as quitter,
canker, wounds, treads, bruises, or such formation
of matter by which a part of the hoof
has been unavoidably destroyed, or necessarily
taken away. In the regeneration of parts,
the incarnation (from the rigid and horny
nature of the hoof) is irregular and imperfect,
forming a sort of cleft (or artificial union)
with the sound part upon the surface, productive
of a sensible weakness underneath.
This imperfect and defective junction renders
such quarter, as it is called, inadequate to the
weight it is destined to bear; in which case
much judgment is required, and may be exerted,
in the palliation, as perfect cure is not
to be expected. Care must be taken in
forming the shoe to relieve the tender part
from the pressure, by hollowing it at that
particular spot, and letting the bearing be
fixed entirely upon the sound parts. By constant
attention in reducing the prominent
edges of the irregular projection with the fine
side of the rasp, and a few occasional impregnations
with fine spermaceti oil, the hoof may
be sometimes restored to its original formation.—<i>Taplin.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Farcy</span>, s. The leprosy of horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farcy is intimately connected with glanders;
they will run into each other, or their
symptoms will mingle together, and before
either arrives at its fatal termination its associate
will almost invariably appear. An animal
inoculated with the matter of farcy will
often be afflicted with glanders, while the
matter of glanders will frequently produce
farcy. They are different types or stages of
the same disease. There is, however, a very
material difference in their symptoms and progress,
and this most important of all, that
while glanders are generally incurable, farcy,
in its early stage and mild form, may be successfully
treated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Veterinary writers tell us that it is a disease
of the absorbents in the skin, and therefore
the first indication of this disease, even before
any drooping, or loss of condition, or of appetite,
is generally the appearance of little tumours—<i>farcy
buds</i>—close to some of the
veins, following the course of the veins, and
connected together by a kind of cord, which
farriers call <i>corded veins</i>. When they are
few and small they may possibly exist for
several weeks without being observed; but at
length they increase in number and in size,
and become painful and hot, and some of
them begin to ulcerate. They appear usually
about the face or neck, or inside of the thigh,
and in the latter case there is some general
enlargement of the limb, and lameness.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases, however, the horse will
droop for many a day before the appearance
of the <i>buttons</i> or <i>farcy buds</i>; his appetite
will be impaired;—his coat will stare;—he
will lose flesh. The poison is evidently at
work, but has not gained sufficient power to
cause the absorbents to swell. In a few instances
these buds do not ulcerate, but become
hard and difficult to disperse. The progress
of the disease is then suspended, and possibly
for many months the horse will appear to be
restored to health; but he bears the seeds of
the malady about him, and, all at once, the
farcy assumes a virulent form, and hurries him
off. These buds have sometimes been confounded
with the little tumours, or lumps of
<i>surfeit</i>. They are generally higher than these
tumours; not so broad; have a more knotty
feel, and are principally found on the inside
of the limbs, instead of the outside.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few things are more unlike, or more perplexing,
than the different forms which farcy
assumes at different times. One of the legs,
and particularly one of the hinder legs, will
suddenly swell to an enormous size. At
night the horse will appear to be perfectly
well, and, in the morning, one leg will be
three times the size of the other, with considerable
fever, and scarcely the power of
moving the limb.</p>

<p class='c006'>At other times the head will be subject to
this enlargement—the muzzle will particularly
swell, and a stinking discharge will issue
from the nose. Sometimes the horse will
gradually lose flesh and strength; he will be
hide-bound—mangy eruptions will appear in
different parts; the legs will swell; cracks
will appear at the heels, and the inexperienced
person may conceive it to be a mere want of
condition combined with grease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farcy, like glanders, springs from infection,
or from bad stable management. It is produced
by all the causes which give rise to
glanders; but with this difference, that it is
more frequently generated, and is sometimes
strangely prevalent in particular districts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of farcy varies with the form
it assumes. In the button or bud farcy, a
mild dose of physic should be first administered.
The buds should be then carefully
examined, and if any of them have broken,
the budding iron, of a dull red heat, should
be applied to them; or if matter should be
felt in them, showing that they are disposed
to break, they should be penetrated with the
iron. These wounds should be daily inspected,
and if, when the slough of the cautery comes
off, they look pale, and foul, and spongy, and
discharge a thin matter, they should be frequently
washed with a lotion, composed of a
drachm of corrosive sublimate dissolved in an
ounce of rectified spirit; the other buds should
likewise be examined, and opened with the
iron as soon as they evidently contain matter.
When the wounds begin to look red, and the
bottom of them is even and firm, and they
discharge a thick white or yellow matter, the
friar’s balsam will speedily heal them. As,
however, the constitution is now tainted, local
applications will not be sufficient, and the disease
must be attacked by internal medicines,
as soon as the physic has ceased to operate.
The corrosive sublimate will be the best alterative,
and may be given in doses of ten grains,
gradually increased to a scruple, with two
drachms of gentian and one of ginger, and
repeated morning and night until the ulcers
disappear, unless the horse is violently purged,
or the mouth becomes sore, when a drachm
of blue vitriol may be substituted for the corrosive
sublimate. During this, the animal
should be placed in a large box, with a free
circulation of air; and green meat, or carrots,
the latter more particularly, should be given
him, with a fair allowance of corn. If he
could be turned out during the day, it would
be advantageous; but at all events he should
be daily exercised. It is related by Mr. Blaine,
that a horse so reduced as not to be able to
stand, was drawn into a field of tares, and
suffered to take his chance: the consequence
was, that when he had eaten all within his
reach, he was able to rise and search for more,
and eventually recovered. In an early stage
of the disease, and if glanders have not appeared,
this treatment will frequently succeed.
If, after the wounds have healed, the absorbents
should continue to be corded, a blister,
or light firing, will probably be serviceable.—<i>The

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The large crooked talons of birds of prey,
and their hooked beaks, are well formed
for securing and tearing their victims. The
formation of the feet of the woodpeckers,
the toes being placed two forward and two
backward, is well calculated for climbing,
and the cuneiform shape of the extremity
of their bills is suited to the purpose of cutting
holes in decayed trees; their tongue is
also wonderfully contrived to search out
insects beyond the reach of their bill, by its
great length, which is double that of the
tongue at least. The wryneck has this singularity,
as well as the like formation of toes;
which last is also found in the cuckoo: but
neither of these birds is seen to climb up the
bodies of trees, nor have either the stiff sharp-pointed
feathers in the tail, as in the woodpecker,
so admirably adapted to support them
when in the act of hewing. This agrees with
the observations of an ingenious living naturalist,
the Rev. Revett Shepherd. “The
cuckoo,” says he, “is furnished with two toes
before and two behind, and yet is never
known actually to climb, a convincing proof
that such conformation does not necessarily
bring with it the power of climbing, more especially
when we consider that the nuthatch
(<i>Sitta Europæa</i>), and the creeper (<i>Certhia
familiaris</i>), have their toes placed in the
usual manner, and yet run up and down trees
with as much facility as the woodpeckers.
The use of the <i>pedes scansorii</i>, as they evidently
in this case conduce not to climbing,
I judge to be this; it is well known that this
bird will oftentimes sit by the half-hour together
on the bough of a tree, vociferating its
loud and pleasing note; in doing this, it sits
remarkably forward, and appears in constant
agitation, continually moving its body up and
down with great elegance; now, as it sits so
forward, while using this exertion, it would
be liable to lose its balance and quit its hold,
had it only one toe behind; whereas, by the
contrivance of two, it is enabled strongly to
adhere to the branch.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The legs and feet of aquatic birds are wonderfully
formed for accelerating their motion
in that element, which is their greatest security.
The bone of the leg is sharp, and vastly
compressed sideways: the toes, when the foot
is brought forward, close in behind each other
in such a manner as to expose a very small
surface in front, so that, in the action of swimming,
very little velocity is lost in bringing
the legs forward; this is very conspicuous in
the diver. Some aquatic birds are web-footed
before the whole length of the toes, as in the
ducks; others only half the length of the toes,
like the avoset. Some again have all four
toes webbed, as in the cormorant; others
whose feet are furnished with a fin-like membrane
or each side of the toes; these are
either plain, as in the grebe, or lobed, as
in the coot and phalarope. There are
also some who swim and dive well, whose
toes are long and slender, and not furnished
with webs or fins, such as the water-hen and
rail; but these live as much on land as in
water. The gulls and terns, although web-footed,
seem incapable of diving; the latter,
indeed, we never observed to settle on the
water; the former is so buoyant that it floats
elegantly on the surface. The avoset, whose
feet bespeak it an inhabitant of the water,
does not seem to have the power of swimming;
the water-ouzel, on the other hand,
has not the least appearance of an aquatic,
nor can it swim; but it will dive, and remain
a long time under water. The serrated claw
in the heron and nightjar is a singular structure,
which we have not discovered the use
of. The bill as well as the feet of birds,
makes one of the strong natural divisions;
but these are described under the head of
each genus.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Of Horses.</i>—Contraction is the most general
evil among the feet of our horses, and some
breeds appear more liable to it than others: it is
peculiarly the case with blood-horses. Colour
also seems to have some influence in contracting
the feet; hence I have observed dark chestnuts
particularly prone to it. A good foot
should exhibit a proper line of obliquity:
when the horn is very upright, however wide
and open the heels, such feet soon become
defective. This is but seldom attended to,
even among those who esteem themselves
judges; but no rule admits of fewer exceptions,
than that such a foot soon becomes
faulty. There should also be a proper height
of horn: when there is too much, it disposes
to contraction: when too little, the heels,
quarters, and soles must, of necessity, be
weak, and tenderness in going must be the
consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>heels</i> should be particularly attended
to; they must be wide, and the frog healthy,
firm, yet pliable and elastic. Contraction of
their cleft is their most common defect, and is
frequently accompanied with a general lessening
of the circumference of the foot. Such
a foot will probably feel hotter than natural;
the frog also will be compressed and small,
and very likely thrushy.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a horse’s foot is held up, the sole
should present a concave surface: if it be less
concave than natural, that sole is weak, and
will not bear much pressure; and it is more
than probable it will continue lessening in concavity
until it becomes a plane, when every
subsequent shoeing will endanger the laming
of the animal. <i>White feet</i> are very objectionable
on this account, for they are particularly
liable to become flat in the sole: their
quarters, also, are commonly weak, and fall
in; and when neither of these evils take place,
they yet have seldom strength enough to resist
contraction: and it may be determined
on, that, when there are three dark and one
white foot, in nineteen instances out of twenty,
the white foot becomes defective sooner than
the dark ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another very serious complaint is a brittleness
of hoof, which may be generally be detected
by the marks of the fragile parts detaching
themselves from every old nail-hole.
This kind of foot, particularly in hot weather,
breaks away, till there is no room for the nails
to hold, when the horse, of course, becomes
useless. In an examination of the foot, the
eye should also be directed to the wearing of
the shoe: if it be unequally worn, particularly
if the toe be worn down, such a horse is probably
a stumbler, and does not set his foot
evenly on the ground, either from defective
feet or natural gait.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The feet of horses being the very basis
of support, upon which the safety and expedition
of the frame entirely depends, they
are entitled to every possible degree of care
and attention; more particularly in the winter
season, when, from neglect, so many ills
and inconveniences are known to arise. The
injuries, accidents, and diseases, to which the
feet are constantly liable, consist of cracks in
the heels, scratches or lacerations, stubs and
bruises of the outer sole, or upon the verge
of the coronet between hair and hoof, corns,
sandcracks, thrushes, canker, quitter, ringbone,
and footfounder; exclusive of the frequent
injuries sustained in shoeing, by the
ignorance, indolence, or obstinacy of those
smiths who, having no professional reputation
to support, are too innately confident in their
own ability to bear instruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the defects thus enumerated will be
found individually enlarged upon under distinct
and separate heads, it becomes only necessary
here to lay down such general rules
for the regular management of the feet, as
may (properly attended to) prove the means
of prudent prevention; not more in respect to
the trouble and expense of disease, than of
the most mortifying and repentant anxiety.
These defects and disquietudes are seldom
found but in the stables where the master
rarely or ever condescends to obtrude his person
and commands upon the tenacious dignity
of a self-important groom; the preserving industry
of whose careful endeavours, and the
pliability and elasticity of whose joints, if
properly exerted, would prove the truest and
most infallible preventive of swelled legs and
cracked heels, in preference to all the nostrums
ever yet brought into private practice
or public use. And those who unfortunately
encounter these ills, may generally, and with
justice, attribute them much more to the
constitutional tardiness of the professed groom
(or occasional strapper) than any defect in
the constitution of the horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>The feet of different horses vary exceedingly
in what may be termed the texture or
property of the hoof, and this is in general
regulated by the colour of the legs and feet.
There are few horses with white heels but
what have white hoofs also; and these are
always more liable to, and susceptible of,
defects and weakness, than those of an opposite
description. The sound, firm, dark-coloured
hoof of the bay, brown, or black
horse, is seldom found defective; but those of
other coloured horses are most subject to
weak, thin soles, displaying a prominence on
each side the frog occasioned by a too feeble
and inadequate resistance to the force of the
membranous mass within; feet of which description
are also frequently found to have the
corresponding concomitant of a brittle hoof,
the edges of which are incessantly splitting,
and throwing out a constant threatening of
sandcracks, with the additional mortification
of being subject to inveterate thrushes, or an
almost constantly diseased or putrefied state
of the frog.</p>

<p class='c006'>Feet so exceedingly different in the nature
of their construction, must certainly require
as different a mode of treatment, according to
such circumstances as happen to exist. To
preserve feet perfectly sound, and free from
the ills to which they are subject, cleanliness
is the leading step. After exercise or use,
so soon as the body is drest, the dirt or
gravel should be carefully taken from under
the shoes with a picker, the feet well washed,
the legs and heels rubbed dry, the bottom
stopped with cow-dung, and the hoofs oiled
with a brush impregnated with spermaceti
oil. Horses left with wet legs and heels after
a severe chase, or long journey, particularly
in sharp easterly winds, or during frost and
snow, constitute cracks or scratches to a certainty.
So severe a rigidity is occasioned in
the very texture of the integument, and it
becomes partially ruptured or broken in various
places, upon being brought into expeditious
action; which, with the friction and
irritation then occasioned by the sharp particles
of gravel in dirty roads, soon produce
lacerations of the most painful description.</p>

<p class='c006'>The state of the shoes should be constantly
attended to. Permitted to remain too long
upon the feet, the growth of the hoof brings
the shoe forward, rendering it too short at the
heel, when it begins to indent, and sinking
upon the foot, soon presses upon the outer
sole, constituting pain or disquietude in some
horses, laying the foundation of corns in
others. Horses in moderate work require
new shoes once a month upon an average,
never varying more than two or three days
from that time: indeed, it is not right that
they should go longer. The penurious plan
of removing shoes half worn, is truly ridiculous;
they never render service adequate to
the expense, and the practice only tends
to a more frequent destruction of the hoof.
Thrushes should be counteracted upon their
first appearance, without being permitted to
acquire a corroding virulence. Swelled legs
are hardly ever seen in stables where a proper
course of discipline and regular routine of
business is observed; they proceed from a
viscid, sizy state of the blood, a languor in
the circulation, a want of exercise out of the
stable, or a sufficiency of friction, leg-rubbing,
care, and attention within.</p>

<p class='c006'>In horses fever begins frequently with a cold
or shivering fit, although this is not essential to
fever. The horse is dull, unwilling to move,
with a staring coat, and cold legs and feet.
This is succeeded by warmth of the body;
unequal distribution of warmth to the legs;
one hot, and the other three cold, or some
unnaturally warm, and others unusually cold,
although not the deathy coldness of inflammation
of the lungs; the pulse quick, soft,
and often indistinct; breathing somewhat laborious;
but no cough, or pawing, or looking
at the flanks. The animal will scarcely eat,
and is very costive. While the state of pure
fever lasts, the shivering fit returns at nearly
the same hour every day, and is succeeded by
the warm one, and that often by a very slight
sweating one; and this goes on for several
days until local inflammation appears, or the
fever gradually subsides. No horse ever died
of pure fever; if he is not destroyed by inflammation
of the lungs, or feet, or bowels
succeeding to the fever, he gradually recovers.</p>

<p class='c006'>What we have said of the treatment of
local inflammation will sufficiently indicate
that which we should recommend in fever.
Fever is general increased action of the heart
and arteries, and therefore evidently appears
the necessity for bleeding, regulating the
quantity of blood taken by the degree of
fever, and usually continuing to take it (the
finger being kept on the artery) until some
impression is made upon the system. The
bowels should be gently opened; but the danger
of inflammation of the lungs, and the
uniformly injurious consequence of purgation
in that disease, will prevent the administration
of an active purgative. One drachm and
a half of aloes may be given morning and
night with the proper fever medicine, until
the bowels are slightly relaxed, after which
nothing more of an aperient quality should
be administered. Digitalis, emetic tartar, and
nitre, should be given morning and night, in
proportions regulated by the circumstances of
the case, and these should give way to white
hellebore in doses of half a drachm twice in
the day, if symptoms of inflammation of the
lungs should appear. The horse should be
warmly clothed, but be placed in a cool and
well-ventilated stable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Symptomatic fever is generally increased
arterial action, proceeding from some local
cause. No organ of consequence can be long
disordered or inflamed without the neighbouring
parts being disturbed, and the whole system
gradually participating in the disturbance.
Inflammation of the feet or of the lungs
never existed long to any material extent,
without being accompanied by some degree of
fever.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of symptomatic fever should
resemble that of simple fever, except that
particular attention should be paid to the state
of the part originally diseased. If the inflammation
which existed there can be subdued,
the general disturbance will usually cease.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

each corner of the mouth is furnished with a
few black bristly hairs; the eye is light brown;
the top of the head and back part of the neck
are of a light ash-colour; the former spotted
with black; the back and coverts of the wings
are of a deep hoary brown; the ramp ash-coloured;
the throat and breast are yellow, regularly
spotted with black; the belly and
thighs of a yellowish white; the tail brown, inclining
to black; the legs dusky yellowish
brown; in young birds yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen a variety of this bird, of which
the head and neck were of a yellowish white;
the rest of the body was nearly of the same
colour, mixed with a few brown feathers; the
spots on the breast were faint and indistinct:
the quill feathers were perfectly white, except
one or two on each side, which were brown;
the tail was marked in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>The field-fare is only a visitant in this island,
making its appearance about the beginning of
October, in order to avoid the rigorous winters
of the north, whence it sometimes comes in
great flocks, according to the severity of the
season, and leaves us about the latter end of
February or the beginning of March, and retires
to Russia, Sweden, Norway, and as far as
Siberia and Kamtschatka. Buffon observes
that they do not arrive in France till the beginning
of December, that they assemble in
flocks of two or three thousand, and feed on
ripe crevises, of which they are extremely fond;
during the winter they feed on haws and other
berries; they likewise eat worms, snails, and
slugs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Field-fares seem of a more sociable disposition
than the throstles or the missels: they
are sometimes seen singly, but in general form
very numerous flocks, and fly in a body; and
though they often spread themselves through
the fields in search of food, they seldom lose
sight of each other, but, when alarmed, fly off,
and collect together upon the same tree.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fieldmouse</span>, <i>s.</i> A mouse that burrows in banks.</p>

<p class='c006'>An extraordinary instance of the rapid increase
of mice, and of the injury they sometimes
do, occurred a few years ago in the new
plantations made by order of the crown in
Dean Forest, Gloucestershire, and in the New
Forest, Hampshire. Soon after the formation
of these plantations, a sudden and rapid increase
of mice took place in them, which threatened
destruction to the whole of the young
plants. Vast numbers of these were killed,—the
mice having eaten through the roots of
five-year-old oaks and chestnuts, generally just
below the surface of the ground. Hollies also,
which were five and six feet high, were barked
round the bottom; and in some instances the
mice had crawled up the tree, and were seen
feeding on the bark of the upper branches.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following account will show the numbers
of mice caught in the different inclosures
in Dean Forest in three months, from September
to January, with the number of acres, and
the proportion between the long and the short-tailed
mice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The transition from the bunting to the finch
is very easy, and the shade of difference between
them, in some instances, almost imperceptible;
on which account they have been frequently
confounded with each other. The
principal difference consists in the beak, which
in the finch is conical, very thick at the base,
and tapering to a sharp point: in this respect
it more nearly resembles the grosbeak. Of
this tribe many are distinguished as well for
the liveliness of their song, as for the beauty
and variety of their plumage, on which accounts
they are much esteemed. They are
very numerous, and assemble sometimes in
immense flocks, feeding on seeds and grain of
various kinds, as well as on insects and their
eggs.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The violent inflammation firing occasions,
rouses the absorbent vessels into action, by
which callous or even bony swellings are sometimes
dispersed. The diseases in which it is
most efficacious are spavins, ring-bones, and
callous swellings about the back sinews, the
consequences of strains and windgalls. Firing
draws blood to the affected part, thickens and
strengthens it, and makes the skin act as a
permanent bandage. A blister is often applied
to the part immediately after firing, or on the
following day, to render it more effectual. It
is necessary to observe that the milder remedies
should be tried before this severe operation
is had recourse to. Firing has been recommended
for the purposes of strengthening
the back sinews and hocks of colts, to prevent
strains, and what is termed breaking-down.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been erroneously asserted, that when
firing is employed to a callus of the back
sinews, the swelling should be previously reduced
by blistering; that firing would then
prevent a return; whereas if the firing were
performed in the first place, it would fix the
swelling, and render it incurable. In inflammation,
certainly firing will do harm, therefore
it must be first removed by the frequent
application of a cooling lotion, such as diluted
vinegar, in which a little sugar of lead has been
dissolved.—<i>Percival.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Fishes in general are male and female; the
former possessing the melt and the latter the
roe, although some individuals of the cod and
sturgeon are said to contain both. The spawn
of the greater number of fishes is deposited in
the sand or gravel; and in that state, it is probable
that the roe and melt are mixed together.
A fish whose weight, at twenty years
old, shall be thirty pounds, generates the first
or second year, when perhaps it does not
weigh more than half a pound; and it is certain
that the male seems more attached to the
eggs than the female, for when she ceases to
drop them, the male instantly abandons her,
and with ardour follows the eggs which are
carried down by the stream, or dispersed
amongst the waves by the wind, passing and
repassing many times over every spot where
he finds the eggs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Summer is the usual spawning time, because
at that season the water is tepified by the
beams of the sun, and is therefore better adapted
for quickening the eggs into life. How the
eggs of fishes are impregnated is wholly unknown.
All that obviously offers is, that in
ponds, the sexes are often seen together among
the long grass at the edge of the water; that
there they seem to struggle, and are in a state
of suffering, as they grow thin, lose their appetite,
whilst their flesh becomes flabby, and
in some, the scales grow rough and lose their
lustre; on the contrary, when the time of
coupling is over, their appetite returns, their
natural agility is resumed, and their scales become
brilliant and beautiful. The spawn continues
in the state of eggs a longer or shorter
period, but this is for the most part proportioned
to the size of the animal. The young
animal remains in the form of an egg from
December until April in the salmon kind;
the carp not above three weeks, and the gold
fish from China is produced in a still less time.
With all the advantages of minuteness and agility
when excluded from the egg, there is not
one, perhaps, of a thousand, that survives the
dangers of its youth. Among the spinous
fishes there is no trace of parental affection;
they abandon their eggs to be hatched by the
warmth of the season, and if they ever return
to the spot where their young first received
life, the parents that gave them birth, become
their most formidable enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the rapacity of one another although the
fishes perish by millions, yet they have other
destroyers. Many of the quadrupeds and a
great proportion of the sea fowls, either feed
on fish, are the merciless invaders of the small
fry, or devour the spawn. In a savage state,
numbers of the human race wander round the
lakes and rivers, whence a considerable proportion
of their sustenance is derived, and
among those nations whom arts and agriculture
have rendered less dependent on this
precarious support, superstition has usurped
the place of want, and given a new edge to
their avidity for this species of food; but the
munificent Author of nature, notwithstanding
the annual consumption of fishes is constant
and immense, has made a kind provision
for his creatures, in which the glory of
his providence is remarkable in a twofold
manner. First, by giving fishes at certain
fixed seasons of the year, a particular inclination
to approach the land; and this always at
a time when they are the fattest, and not emaciated
by breeding; as the salmon in the
spring, mackerel about midsummer, herrings
in the autumn, cod in the winter, &amp;c. Secondly,
by the amazing fertility which he has
conferred on this class of beings. The fecundity
of fishes far surpasses that of any other
animals; if we should be told of a being so
prolific, that it would bring forth in one season
as many of its kind as there are inhabitants
in England, our surprise would be deeply
excited, yet upwards of 9,000,000 of ova have
been found in the spawn of a single cod.
1,357,400 have been taken from the belly
of a flounder; the mackerel, carp, tench,
and a variety of others, are endowed with
a fertility but little inferior. Such an astonishing
progeny, were it allowed to arrive
at maturity, would soon overstock the element
allotted them; but their numbers, by the
means above-mentioned, are considerably lessened,
and thus two important purposes are
answered in the economy of nature; by the
extraordinary fruitfulness of fishes, amongst a
host of foes it preserves the species, and furnishes
the rest with an aliment adapted to
their nature.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Fishes are the most voracious animals in
nature. Many species prey indiscriminately
on everything digestible that comes in their
way, and devour not only other species of
fishes, but even their own. As a counter-balance
to this voracity, they are amazingly
prolific. Some bring forth their young alive;
others produce eggs. The viviparous blenny
brings forth 200 or 300 live fishes at a time.
Those which produce eggs are all much more
prolific, and seem to proportion their stock to
the danger of consumption. Leuwenhoek affirms
that the cod spawns above 9,000,000 in
a season. The flounder produces above
1,000,000, and the mackerel above 500,000.
Scarcely one in a hundred of these eggs, however,
is supposed to come to maturity; but
two wise purposes are answered by this amazing
increase: it preserves the species in the
midst of numberless enemies, and serves to
furnish the rest with a sustenance adapted to
their nature.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>How long a fish, that seems to have scarce
any bounds put to its growth, continues to
live, is not ascertained; the date prescribed as
the age of man, would not perhaps be sufficient
to measure the life of the smallest. In
the royal ponds at Marli, in France, there are
some fishes that have been preserved tame
since the time, it is said, of Francis the First,
and which have been individually known to
the persons who have succeeded to the charge
of them, ever since that period. These have
now attained a size much beyond the common
bulk of fishes of the same kind; and although
there are certain peculiarities distinguishing
them from younger fishes, yet they evince no
symptoms of that decrepitude and disease, which
inevitably accompany a life protracted much
beyond the usual space, among quadrupeds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When any fish is hog-backed, with a small
head, this is a sure sign of that fish being in
season, of whatever sort it is.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Very little is known of the habits and economy
of fish from the nature of the element
in which they live. When I resided in Bushy
Park, I caused the sides and bottom of a
place to be bricked, through which a stream
of very clear water ran, and stocked it with
most of the varieties of our English fresh-water
fish, supplying them abundantly with food;
but though I constantly watched them, and
could see all they did at any time of the day,
the result of my observations was far from
being satisfactory. The perch were the boldest
and most familiar of any of the fish, as I
found no difficulty in soon getting them to come
with eagerness to take a worm out of my hand.
The barbel were the shyest, and seemed most
impatient of observation, although in the spring,
when they could not perceive any one watching
them, they would roll about and rub themselves
against the brickwork, and show considerable
playfulness. There were some large
stones in my <i>piscatorium</i>, round which they
would wind their spawn in considerable quantities.
The trout appeared to bear their confinement
with less philosophy than any of the
others, making high leaps against the grating
which admitted the water, and seeming at all
times out of sorts and out of condition. The
chub were also very restless, being continually
on the move, but they never could resist a
cockchafer when thrown to them. My flounders
only moved at night, and the eels always
made their escape, but in what way I never
could conjecture, except, indeed, they had the
power of crawling up the brickwork, which
was about five feet from top to bottom, and
generally two feet above the edge of the water.
They certainly could not get through the
grating, which was sufficiently close to confine
bleak and gudgeons; and some of the eels were
of a large size. The pike, of which I had eight
of about five pounds’ weight each, kept up their
character for voracity. Out of 800 gudgeons,
which were brought to me by a Thames fisherman,
and which I saw counted into the reservoir,
some few of which however died, there
were scarcely any to be seen at the end of three
weeks, though I should mention that the three
large barbel I had, and six good-sized perch,
probably partook of them.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The author of the Wild Sports of the
West, in speaking of the immense Loughs
Masks and Corrib, says—“It would appear,
that in these lakes the fish are commensurate
to the waters they inhabit. It is no unusual
event for pikes of thirty pounds weight to be
sent to their landlords by the tenants; and
fish of even fifty pounds have not unfrequently
been caught with nets and night-lines.
The trouts in those loughs are also
immensely large. From fifteen to sixteen
pounds is no unusual size, and some have
been found that reached the enormous weight
of thirty. The perch tribe appear the smallest
in the scale of relative proportion. These
seldom exceed a herring size; but they too
have exceptions, and perch of three or four
pounds weight have been sometimes seen.
Within fifty years this latter fish has increased
prodigiously, and in the lakes and rivers where
they abound, trouts have been found to diminish
in an equal ratio.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Pike and perch were almost unknown in
the rivers of Belcarra and Minola, and the
chain of lakes with which they communicate,
and these waters were then second to none
for trout-fishing. Within ten years, my cousin
tells me that he often angled in them,
and that he frequently killed from three to
six dozen of beautiful middle-sized red trouts.
Now fly-fishing is seldom practised there.
The trout is nearly extinct, and quantities of
pike and perch infest every pool and stream.
The simplest methods of taking fish will be
here found successful, and the lakes of Westmeath
will soon be rivalled by the loughs of
Mayo.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is a curious fact, that the loughs where
the party angled, though situate in the same
valley, and divided only by a strip of moorland
not above fifty yards across, united by
the same rivulet, and in depth and soil at
bottom, to all appearance, precisely similar,
should produce fish as different from each
other as it is possible for those of the same
species to be. In the centre lake, the trout
are dull, ill-shaped, and dark-coloured; the
head large, the body lank, and though of
double size, compared to their neighbours, are
killed with much less opposition. In the adjacent
loughs, their hue is golden and pellucid,
tinted with spots of a brilliant vermilion. The
scales are bright, the head small, the shoulder
thick, and from their compact shape, they
prove themselves, when hooked, both active
and vigorous. At table they are red and firm,
and their flavour is particularly fine—while
the dark trout are white and flaccid, and have
the same insipidity of flavour which distinguishes
a spent from a healthy salmon.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is remarkable that only three kinds of
fish have been transported from foreign parts
into Great Britain—the carp, the tench, and
the gold-fish.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Maxims on fishing.</i>—The following hints
are quaint and useful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not imagine that, because a fish does
not instantly dart off on first seeing you, he
is the less aware of your presence; he almost
always on such occasion ceases to feed, and
pays you the compliment of devoting his
attention to you, whilst he is preparing for a
start whenever the apprehended danger becomes
sufficiently imminent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you pass your fly neatly and well
three times over a trout, and he refuses it, do
not wait any longer for him; you may be
sure he has seen the line of invitation which
you have sent over the water to him, and
does not intend to come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Remember that, in whipping with the artificial
fly, it must have time, when you have
drawn it out of the water, to make the whole
circuit, and to be at one time straight behind
you, before it can be driven out straight before
you. If you give it the forward impulse
too soon, you will hear a crack: take this as
a hint that your fly is gone to grass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It appears to me that, in whipping with
an artificial fly, there are only two cases in
which a fish taking the fly will infallibly
hook himself without your assistance, viz.:—1st,
when your fly first touches the water at
the end of a straight line: 2d, when you are
drawing out your fly for a new throw. In
all other cases, it is necessary that, in order to
hook him when he has taken the fly, you
should do something with your wrist which
is not easy to describe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If your line should fall loose and wavy
into the water, it will either frighten away the
fish, or he will take the fly into his mouth,
without fastening himself; and when he finds
that it does not answer his purpose, he will
spit it out again before it has answered yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind what they of the old school
say about ‘playing him till he is tired.’ Much
valuable time, and many a good fish, may be
lost by this antiquated proceeding. Put him
into your basket as soon as you can. Every
thing depends on the manner in which you
commence your acquaintance with him. If
you can at first prevail upon him to walk a
little way down the stream with you, you will
have no difficulty afterwards in persuading
him to let you have the pleasure of seeing
him at dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not leave off fishing early in the
evening, because your friends are tired. After a
bright day, the largest fish are to be caught by
whipping between sunset and dark. Even,
however, in these precious moments, you will
not have good sport, if you continue throwing
after you have whipped your fly off. Pay
attention to this; and, if you have any doubt
after dusk, you may easily ascertain the point,
by drawing the end of the line quickly through
your hand, particularly if you do not wear
gloves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you have got hold of a good fish
which is not very tractable, if you are married,
gentle reader, think of your wife, who,
like the fish, is united to you by very tender
ties, which can only end with her death, or
her going into weeds. If you are single, the
loss of the fish, when you thought the prize
your own, may remind you of some more
serious disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never angle in glaring-coloured clothes;
perhaps green is that which the fish discern
least, as varying less from those objects, such
as trees, and herbage on the sides, to which
they are familiarised. The angler should
shelter himself (unless the water is muddy
from rain) far from the bank, or behind a
bush or tree, where he can just see the float,
and so that his shadow does not, at any time,
lie upon the water, especially where it is
shallow, and the gravelly bottom can be discerned.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The angler should always have the wind at
his back, the sun or moon before him, as
much as possible; in cold, windy weather especially,
he should be on the weather-shore,
where the fish then resort for warmth, and
the calmness of the water. The east wind,
for angling, has been universally execrated,
but probably this may not hold good in rivers
running from east to west.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>At the conflux of rivers that ebb and flow,
it is best angling at the ebb; sometimes,
when the tide is not strong, they will bite at
flood, but very rarely at high water.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Deep waters are best to angle in, as the
fish are not then disturbed by wind or weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best periods are from April to October;
from three until nine in the morning,
and from three in the afternoon, so long as
there is light; the later, the better sport. In
winter, the weather and times are much alike;
the warmest is most preferable.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>During the summer, even when the water
is quite low and clear, no wind stirring, and
the sun shining in its utmost lustre, and in
the hottest part of the day, it is insisted,
trout may be taken (although very few anglers
are disposed to credit it), with a small
wren’s-tail, grouse, smoky dun, and black
hackles, fishing straight down the water by
the sides of streams and banks; keeping out
of sight, and with as long a line as can conveniently
be managed, with the foot-length
very fine: they may be often seen with their
fins above water, at which time they will
eagerly snap at the abovementioned flies; and
though upon hooking one the rest will fly
off, they will soon be composed, and return
for two or three times.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Right of Fishing.</i>—It has been held that
where the lord of the manor hath the soil on
both sides of the river, it is a good evidence
that he hath right of fishing; and it puts the
proof upon him who claims liberam piscariam;
but, where a river ebbs and flows, and is an
arm of the sea, there it is common to all, and
he who claims a privilege to himself, must
prove it; for if the trespass is brought for
fishing there, the defendant may justify that
the place is brachium maris, in quo unusquique
subditus domini regis habet et habere debet
liberam piscariam. In the Severn the soil
belongs to the owners of the land on each
side; and the soil of the river Thames is in
the king, but the fishing is common to all.
He who is owner of the soil of a private river,
hath separata piscaria; and he that hath libera
piscaria, hath a property in the fish, and may
bring a possessory action for them; but communis
piscaria is like the case of all other commons.
One that has a close pond, in which
there are fish, may call them pisces suas, in
an indictment, &amp;c.; but he cannot call them
bona et catalla, if they be not in tanks. There
needs no privilege to make a fish-pond, as there
doth in case of a warren.—<i>Ency. Brit.</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c006'>Flews may be described as of two kinds,
the one for drawing, the other to be placed
either as a stop to a drag-net, or to be set and
left quietly standing in a pond or river, to intercept
the fish. Those for drawing should
be made of stouter materials, and the lint of
all should be of silk. The expense is greater at
the first; but the compiler has had silk flews
of both sorts, where the lint has outlasted
three sets of walling, and still remained perfectly
good. It must, however, be understood,
that great care was observed in the washing
and drying his nets; for silk has no peculiar
power, any more than hemp, to defend itself
against the heat, which a few hours will generate
when thrown together full of mud and
weeds; and both, by such slovenly inattention,
are as quickly spoiled: yet carefully managed,
a silk net will endure to the utmost wishes of
the proprietor; and such is the quality of the
silk, when wet, that the fish which touches it
is sure to be entangled; the texture is so
pliant, that a fish is enveloped before being
sensible of it, and the more he struggles the
faster he is confined.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a dragging-flew, the lint two inches
and a quarter mesh, seventy meshes deep, and
fifty-two yards in length (to be hung twenty
yards long and eight feet deep), it will take
four pounds and a half of silk.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a setting flew, of a similar mesh, and
ninety deep, with the same length of lint and
depth of hanging, five pounds and a quarter
of silk; from these may be calculated any
larger or smaller size. Never tan or colour
flews, it renders them easier to be discerned
by the fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The walls or trammels of flews should be
at least eighteen inches square (but two feet
is preferable), those of nine or twelve inches,
hung diamond fashion, are only calculated to
receive a fish that strikes point blank; it is
impossible for a good sized fish to get in sideways,
(whereby they are more entangled than
by touching the flew in any other direction),
besides, these small wallings render a net
more cumbersome, and are, for the most part,
useless. Flews should be very lightly leaded,
the floats or corks nicely adjusted, and where
the fish run very large, the mesh of the lint
may be extended; always recollecting that in
thread nets, the materials for the lint must be
three twisted, and cannot be too strong or too
fine.</p>

<p class='c006'>In carp-fishing, drawing with flews is the
most killing mode yet devised, they slide so
lightly over the mud, and hamper the fish in
their progress through the water, which the
drag-net does not.</p>

<p class='c006'>None are better than the most transparent

(considered as good as any) come to London
from Lord Cadogan’s estate at Brandon. They
should be put in with the flat side upwards,
and stand well clear of the hammer, and yet
be long enough to throw it. Screw them in
with leather, as lead strains the cock, and
cloth is dangerous from being liable to catch
fire. If very particular about the neat appearance
of your gun, get a punch for stamping
the leathers, and change them as often as
you put new flints.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make a flint strike lower you have only
to reverse the usual way of putting it in;
but, if you want to strike higher, you must
either put a very thick leather, or screw the
flint in with a bit of something under it.
This temporary way of regulating a lock, so
as to make the hammer fall, is worth knowing,
as it often saves vexation and loss of time.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Float</span>, <i>s.</i> The act of flowing; any body so contrived or formed as to swim
on the water; the cork or quill by which the angler discovers the bite.</p>

<p class='c006'>Floats are of many kinds; of swan, goose,
muscovy duck, and porcupine quills. The
first is preferable, when light baits are used
in rivers or deep waters, and the others for
slow streams and ponds, where the water is
not very deep, and where the baits are pastes,
&amp;c. The quills of the bustard some anglers
use, believing that the small black spots with
which they are (erroneously) said to be mottled,
appear to the fish as so many little flies,
and attract them by this deception. For heavy
fishing with worm or minnow, and in rapid
eddies, the cork float is best, and is made by
taking a cork free from flaws, and with a small
red hot iron bore a hole lengthways through
the centre; it is then to be cut across the
grain with a sharp knife, about two-thirds of
the length, and the remaining third (which is
the top of the float) rounded with it, and then
neatly finished with pumice stone, the whole
resembling in shape a child’s peg top. For
pike, barbel, and large chub, the cork should
be the size of a small bergamot pear; for trout,
perch, eels, not bigger than a walnut when the
green rind is removed. A quill is fitted to
the hole, and used formerly to be cut off close
to the cork at each end of it. Some direct
cork floats to be proportioned to the number
of hairs the line is made of, and no larger
than a horsebean for a single hair; but so
diminutive a cork is of no use, and the quill
floats will answer better.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some recommend the shape of a cork like
a pear, and not to exceed the size of a nutmeg,
and the quill that passes through it not
to be more than half an inch above and below
the cork; they are now made with a cap at
the top, and wire for the line to pass through
at the bottom. The advantage the cork float
has over the bare quill is that it allows the
line to be loaded so heavily, that the hook
sinks almost as soon as put into the water;
whereas, when lightly loaded, it does not reach
the bottom until near the end of the swim.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Quill floats are thus made: the barrel part
is cut off from that where the feathers grow,
the inside cleared from the film, and a small
piece of pitch fixed close to the end; a piece
of cotton is then introduced, and upon that
another piece of pitch, which not only confines
the cotton, but assists in making the float discernible
in water. A piece of soft wood, the
size of the quill, about two inches long, of
which nearly one inch is to be introduced into
the quill, after being dipped into a melted cement
of bees-wax, resin, and chalk, in equal
quantities; the lower end of this plug is to be
tapered, with a fine awl, a piece of brass twisted
wire, with a round eye at the end, is to be
passed as a screw into the plug, with a pair of
pliers, turning round in the float; the line
passes through this eye of the wire, and the
upper part of the quill is fastened to the line
by a hoop made of a larger sized quill, so as to
admit the thickness of the line, and which
ought to fasten nearly an inch from the top of
the quill. (These caps should be secured by
fine waxed silk, varnished over, which prevents
their splitting; as also should the end of
the quill round the plug, which will greatly
preserve the float.) These hoops upon the
top of the float may be dyed red (which will
render them more conspicuous), by putting as
much powdered Brazil wood into stale chamber-ley
as will make it a deep red, which may
be seen by applying it upon a piece of white
paper; then take some spring-water, and put a
handful of salt and a small quantity of argal
into it; stir them until they are dissolved, and
boil them well in a saucepan; when the water
is cold, scrape the quills, and steep them a little
time in the mixture; afterwards let them
remain in the chamber-ley for a fortnight, and,
after drying, rub them with a woollen cloth,
and they will be transparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>If two quills are wanted to be joined together,
it may be done by a plug a little thicker
in the middle than at the ends, which is to go
into the mouth of the quills; dip the two ends
into the above cement warmed, and fix the
quills upon it, or by dipping the two ends of
both quills, without the plug, into the cement,
and inserting one into the other while thoroughly
warm, the cement, when cold, will
strongly fix them; rub the float all over with
wet coal-dust and a woollen cloth, dry it with
one of linen, and, after that, dry coal-dust will
polish it effectually. Quill floats should be
so leaded as to just suffer their tops to appear
above the surface, that the slightest nibble
may be perceived; if either a cork or a quill
float fall on one side, the lead is either on the
ground, or insufficient to keep them in a proper
position.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fishing with a float, the line should be
a foot shorter than the rod; if longer, it is
inconvenient when a fish is wanted to be disengaged;
and the rod should be fourteen or
fifteen feet long, light, stiff, and so smart in
the spring as to strike at the extremity of the
whalebone.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Fisher’s Guide, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The flounder inhabits every part of the
British sea, and is found, although at a great
distance, in all the rivers that communicate
with it; numbers of them that are not taken,
lose themselves, continuing and breeding with
vast fecundity in the rivers, and those grow
to be the largest and best flavoured. They will
likewise live in ponds, and are a profitable
fish to stock them with, as they soon get fat,
will live many hours out of their element,
and consequently may be carried to a great
distance; but they will not breed when confined.
The colour of the upper part of the
body is a pale brown, sometimes marked with
a few spots of dirty yellow; the belly is white.
It may easily be distinguished from the plaice,
or any other fish of this genus, by a row of
sharp small spines that surround its upper
sides, and are placed just at the juncture of
the fins with the body; another row marks
the side line, and runs half way down the
back. Mr. Pennant mentions hearing of one
that weighed six pounds; but a flounder of
half that weight is not common. Flounders
spawn in May and June, and are in season
the rest of the year. They swim in shoals, and
bite freely at all hours of the day, but particularly
on the rise of the water by flood or
tide, and in warm weather, with a little wind,
and are to be fished for with a strong line and
good gut at the bottom, as some of them are
large, and struggle much. The best places to
angle for them, are by the sides and at the
tails of deep streams, where the bottom consists
of fine gravel, sand, or loam, or in still
places of the same quality near the banks;
two or three rods may be used, with a bullet
on the lines, to lie on the ground in streams;
and when in still water, a shot or two on the
line, and the hook small. Brandlings that
are taken from rotten tan, well scoured, are
the best baits. They will take the lobworm,
and even the minnow; a flounder weighing
twenty-three ounces being caught in 1799
with the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>From my own experience I should suppose
that in all the habitable parts of the globe,
certain water-flies exist wherever there is
running water. Even in the most ardent
temperature, gnats and musquitoes are found,
which lay their congeries of eggs on the water,
which, when hatched, become, first worms,
afterwards small shrimp-like aurelia, and,
lastly, flies. There are a great number of
the largest species of these flies on stagnant
waters and lakes, which form a part of the
food of various fishes, principally of the carp
kind; but the true fisherman’s fly—those
which are imitated in our art—principally
belong to the northern, or at least temperate
parts of Europe, and I believe are nowhere
more abundant than in England. It appears
to me, that since I have been a fisherman,
which is now the best part of half a century,
I have observed in some rivers where I have
been accustomed to fish habitually, a diminution
of the numbers of flies. There were
always some seasons in which the temperature
was favourable to a quantity of fly; for
instance, fine warm days in spring for the
grannam, or brown-fly; and like days in May
and June for the alder-fly, May-fly, and stone-fly:
but I should say, that within the last
twenty years I have observed a general diminution
of the spring and autumnal flies,
except in those rivers which are fed from
sources that run from chalk, and which are
perennial—such as the Wandle, and the
Hampshire and Buckinghamshire rivers; in
these streams the temperature is more uniform,
and the quantity of water does not vary much.
I attribute the change of the quantity of flies
in the rivers to the cultivation of the country.
Most of the bogs or marshes which fed many
considerable streams are drained; and the
consequence is, that they are more likely to
be affected by severe droughts and great
floods—the first killing, and the second washing
away the larvæ and aurelias. May-flies,
thirty years ago, were abundant in the upper
part of the Teme river, in Herefordshire,
where it receives the Clun: they are now
rarely seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>In December and January there are a few
small gnats or waterflies on the water in the
middle of the day, in bright days, or when
there is sunshine. These are generally black,
and they escape the influence of the frost by
the effects of light on their black bodies, and
probably by the extreme rapidity of the motions
of their fluids, and generally of their organs.
They are found only at the surface of the
water, where the temperature must be above
the freezing point. In February a few double-winged
water-flies which swim down the
stream are usually found in the middle of the
day—such as the willow-fly; and the cow-dung
fly is sometimes carried on the water by
winds. In March there are several flies found
on most rivers. The grannam or green-tail
fly, with a wing like a moth, comes on generally
morning and evening, from five till eight
o’clock, <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> in mild weather in the end of
March and through April. Then there are
the blue and brown, both ephemeral, which
come on, the first in dark days, the second in
bright days; these flies, when well imitated,
are very destructive to fish. The first is a
small fly with a palish yellow body, and slender,
beautiful wings, which rest on the back
as it floats down the water. The second,
called the cob in Wales, is three or four
times as large, and has brown wings, which
likewise protrude from the back, and its
wings are shaded like those of a partridge,
brown and yellow-brown. These three kinds
of flies lay their eggs in the water, which produce
larvæ that remain in the state of worms,
feeding and breathing in the water till they
are prepared for their metamorphosis and quit
the bottoms of the rivers, and the mud and
stones, for the surface, and the light and air.
The brown fly usually disappears before the
end of April, likewise the grannam; but of
the blue dun, there is a succession of different
tints, or species, or varieties, which appear in
the middle of the day, all the summer and
autumn long. These are the principal flies
on the Wandle—the best and clearest stream
near London. In early spring these flies have
dark olive bodies; in the end of April and
beginning of May they are found yellow;
and in the summer they become cinnamon-coloured;
and again, as the winter approaches,
gain a darker hue. I do not, however, mean
to say that they are the same flies, but more
probably successive generation of ephemera of
the same species. The excess of heat seems
equally unfavourable as the excess of cold, to
the existence of the smaller species of water
insects, which, during the intensity of sunshine,
seldom appear in summer, but rise
morning and evening only. The blue dun
has, in June and July, a yellow body; and
there is a water-fly which in the evening is
generally found before the moths appear,
called the red spinner. Towards the end of
August, the ephemera appear again in the
middle of the day—a very pale, small ephemera,
which is of the same colour as that
which is seen in some rivers in the beginning
of July. In September and October, this
kind of fly is found with an olive body, and it
becomes darker in October, and paler in November.
There are two other flies which
appear in the end of September, and continue
during October, if the weather be mild; a
large yellow fly with a fleshy body and wings
like a moth, and a small fly with four wings,
with a dark or claret-coloured body, that when
it falls on the water has its wings like the
great yellow fly, flat on its back. This, or a
claret-bodied fly, very similar in character,
may be likewise found in March or April, on
some waters. In this river I have often
caught many large trout in April and the
beginning of May, with the blue dun, having
the yellow body; and in the upper part of
the stream below St. Alban’s, and between
that and Watford, I have sometimes, even as
early as April, caught fish in good condition;
but the true season for the Colne is the season
of May-fly. The same may be said of
most of the large English rivers containing
large trouts, and abounding in May-fly: such
as the Test and the Kennet; the one running
by Stockbridge, the other by Hungerford.
But in the Wandle at Carshalton and Beddington,
the May-fly is not found: and the
little blues are the constant, and, when well
imitated, killing flies on this water; to which
may be joined a dark alder fly, and a red
evening fly. In the Avon, at Ringwood and
Fordingbridge, the May-fly is likewise a killing
fly; but as this is a grayling river, the
other flies, particularly the grannam and blue
and brown, are good in spring, and the alder-fly
or pale blue later, and the blue dun in
September and October, and even November.
In the streams in the mountainous parts of
Britain, the spring and autumnal flies are by
far the most killing. The Usk was formerly
a very productive trout stream, and the fish
being well fed by the worms washed down by
the winter floods, were often in good season,
cutting red in March and the beginning of
April: and at this season the blues and
browns, particularly when the water was a
little stained after a small flood, afforded the
angler good sport.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>As we are on the subject of tying, I must
observe, that the advantage one derives from
being able to construct his own flies is wonderful;
in fact, without attaining this accomplishment
in the ‘gentle art,’ no one can fish comfortably
or successfully. No stock, however
extensive, will afford a supply adapted for
every change of weather and water, and a man
may lose a day overlooking an interminable
variety of kinds and colours, in a vain search
after one killing fly. Not so the artist: the
favourite insect being once ascertained, he
speedily produces an imitation and fills his
basket, while his less fortunate neighbour is
idly turning the pages of his over-stocked fishing-book.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had two sporting friends, who were excellent
instances of this. Colonel S—— was an
ardent, and, I may add, a very tolerable angler.
No one went to more trouble and expense
in procuring the most approved flies; he
never tied, or attempted to tie one, and he
assured me he had many hundred dozens in
his possession. To find a new fly, was with
him sometimes the labour of a day: and when
about to try another water, he would spend
hours toiling through his immense variety,
before he could succeed in discovering the necessary
colour and description. I have seen
him with Job-like patience, labouring through
endless papers and parcels in search of a paltry
insect, that I could fabricate in five minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>His companion, Captain B——, ran into
an opposite extreme. He rarely had a second
casting line, and seldom a second set of flies.
Did the day change, or the river fill or lower,
he sat down on the bank, ripped wings and dubbings
from his hooks, and prepared a new outfit
in a twinkling. I never met an angler who
was so certain of filling a basket as my friend
B——. His system, however, I would totally
disapprove of. Without burthening oneself
with enough to furnish out a tackle-shop,
a small and effective collection is desirable,
and it is absurd to lose a fortunate half-hour
tying on the river bank, what could be more
conveniently fabricated during the tedium of
a wet day within doors. An accident may rob
the most discreet angler of his flies, and surely
it is necessary to have a fresh relay to put up?
But though I take a sufficiency along with me,
I never leave home without being provided
with the materials for constructing new ones.
An hour may bring ephemeræ on the waters,
which you must imitate, or you will cast in
vain; before evening they will have vanished,
and given place to some new variety of the insect
world. Thus far, at least, the tier possesses
an advantage over him who cannot produce
a fly, that no collection which human
ingenuity can form will compensate.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fly-fishing, the angler should recollect to
take with him some portion of all the different
materials for fly-making: so whimsical sometimes
are trouts, that they may be seen to take

catch one of such flies, and try how nearly art

<p class='c006'>The efficacy of a fomentation depends on
its being properly applied: therefore, the
liquid should be only <i>as hot as the part can
bear without pain</i>. Large flannel cloths
should be dipped into the fomentation, lightly
wrung out, and spread over the affected part,
and be renewed before they become cold; this
ought to be continued for half an hour at least,
and repeated three or four times a day.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Emollient fomentation</i> is adapted to inflamed
swellings, from whatever cause they
may arise; and, in the absence of others, warm
water alone will be found an useful substitute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Warm water, if used assiduously, and at a
proper temperature, is an excellent fomentation.
In inflammation of the eye, it should
not be above 98°; in inflamed and painful
swellings it should seldom exceed 100°. In
strains of the back sinews, vinegar is preferable;
and as the injury is deeply seated, the
fomentation may be applied hotter.</p>

<p class='c006'>When employed for inflammation of the
bowels, it should be still hotter, so hot, indeed,
that the hand cannot feel it without
pain. The best mode of application is by
a long piece of woollen cloth, with the ends
joined, that it may be wrung out of the boiling
liquor by placing a stick through each
end. When thus applied, it may be called
a <i>steam fomentation</i>. A man on either
side the horse is required to apply this fomentation
effectually. Where the injury is not
extensive, the fomentation may be applied
with a large sponge, or a thick woollen cloth,
or old rug or blanket.—<i>White.</i></p>

from the upper point of the shoulder
blade to the very extremity of the ear. A
forehand of this description adds greatly to
the majestic appearance and value of a horse.

it will be necessary to get before the
horse. It is the space extending from the
roots of the ears, and between the eyes, which
being broad and flat, having a feather or star
in the centre, constitutes a degree of beauty,
and may be supposed to have a cross of the
Arabian in the blood. If a horse having a
wide flat forehead, has the advantage of a full
prominent spirited eye, they at the first approach
afford no small indication of excellence;
and, upon nearer inspection, a corresponding

from thence to the coronary bone, in part fills

in the coffin-bone, supported by the nut-bone
behind; these last are deposited in the membraneous
mass denominated the inner sole,
the whole being terminated by the bottom of
the hoof, the frog, and the outer sole. The
forelegs, to be uniform (in a front view),

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_202.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The fox is a native of almost every quarter
of the globe, and is of such a wild nature,
that it is impossible fully to tame him. He
is esteemed the most sagacious and most crafty
of all beasts of prey. The former quality he
shows in his mode of providing himself an
asylum, where he retires from pressing dangers,
where he dwells, and where he brings
up his young: and his craftiness is discovered
by his schemes to catch lambs, geese, hens,
and all kinds of small birds. The fox, if possible,
fixes his abode on the border of a wood,
in the neighbourhood of some farm or village:
he listens to the crowing of the cocks, and the
cries of the poultry; he scents them at a distance;
he chooses his time with judgment; he
conceals his road as well as his design; he
slips forward with caution, sometimes even
trailing his body, and seldom makes a fruitless
expedition. If he can leap the wall, or get
in underneath, he ravages the court-yard, puts
all to death, and retires softly with his prey,
which he either hides under the herbage, or
carries off to his kennel. He returns in a few
minutes for another, which he carries off and
conceals in the same manner, but in a different
place. In this way he proceeds till the
progress of the sun, or some movements perceived
in the house, advertise him that it is
time to suspend his operations, and to retire
to his den. He plays the same game with the
catchers of thrushes, woodcocks, &amp;c. He
visits the nets and bird-lime very early in the
morning, carries off successively the birds
which are entangled, and lays them in different
places, especially by the sides of highways,
in the furrows, under the herbage or brushwood,
where they sometimes lie two or three
days; but he knows perfectly where to find
them when he is in need. He hunts the
young hares in the plains, seizes old ones in
their seats, digs out the rabbits in the warrens,
discovers the nests of partridges and quails,
seizes the mother on the eggs, and destroys
a vast quantity of game. He is exceedingly
voracious, and, when other food fails him,
makes war against rats, field-mice, serpents,
lizards, and toads. Of these he destroys vast
numbers, and this is the only service that he
appears to do to mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>When urged by hunger, he will also eat
roots or insects; and the foxes near the coasts
will devour crabs, shrimps, or shell-fish. In
France and Italy they do incredible mischief,
by feeding on grapes, of which they are excessively
fond.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are told by Buffon, that he sometimes
attacks bee-hives, and the nests of wasps, for
the sake of what he can find to eat: and that
he frequently meets with so rough a reception,
as to force him to retire, that he may
roll on the ground and crush those that are
stinging him; but having thus rid himself of
his troublesome companions, he instantly returns
to the charge, and obliges them at length
to forsake their combs, and leave them as a
reward of his victory. When pressed by necessity
he will devour carrion. “I once,”
says M. Buffon, “suspended on a tree, at the
height of nine feet, some meat, bread, and
bones. The foxes had been at severe exercise
during the night; for next morning the
earth all round was beaten, by their jumping,
as smooth as a barn-floor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The fox exhibits a great degree of cunning
in digging young rabbits out of their burrows.
He does not enter the hole, for in that case he
would have to dig several feet along the ground,
under the surface of the earth; but he follows
their scent above, till he comes to the end,
where they lay, and then scratching up the
earth, descends immediately upon, and devours
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pontoppidan informs us, that when the fox
observes an otter go into the water to fish, he
will frequently hide himself behind a stone,
and when the otter comes to shore with his
prey, he will make such a spring upon him,
that the affrighted animal runs off, and leaves
his booty behind. A certain person, continues
this writer, was surprised on seeing a
fox near a fisherman’s house, laying a parcel
of storks’ heads in a row: he waited the
event; the fox hid himself behind them, and
made a booty of the first crow that came for
a bit of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fox prepares for himself a convenient
den, in which he lies concealed during the
greater part of the day.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is so contrived, as to afford the best
possible security to the inhabitant, being situated
under hard ground, the roots of trees,
&amp;c. and is besides furnished with proper outlets,
through which he may escape in case of
necessity. This care and dexterity in constructing
for himself a habitation, is, by M.
Buffon, considered as alone sufficient to rank
the fox among the higher order of quadrupeds,
since it implies no small degree of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fox, (says he,) knows how to ensure
his safety, by providing himself with an asylum
to which he retires from pressing dangers,
where he dwells, and where he brings up his
young. He is not a vagabond, but lives settled
in a domestic state. This difference, though
it appears even among men, has greater effects,
and supposes more powerful causes, among the
inferior animals. The single idea of a habitation,
or settled place of abode, the art of
making it commodious, and concealing the
avenues to it, imply a superior degree of sentiment.</p>

<p class='c006'>He is one of those animals that, in this
country, are made objects of diversion in the
chase. When he finds himself pursued, he
generally makes towards his hole, and penetrating
to the bottom, lies till a terrier is sent
in to him. If his den is under a rock, or the
roots of trees, which is often the case, he is
safe, for the terrier is no match for him there;
and he cannot be dug out by his enemies.
When the retreat to his kennel is cut off, his
stratagems and shifts to escape are as surprising
as they are various. He always takes to
the most woody parts of the country, and prefers
the paths that are most embarrassed with
thorns and briers. He runs in a direct line
before the hounds, and at no great distance
from them; and, if hard pushed, seeks the
low wet grounds, as if conscious that the scent
does not lie so well there. When overtaken,
he becomes obstinately desperate, and bravely
defends himself against the teeth of his adversaries,
even to the last gasp.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Goldsmith relates a remarkable instance
of the parental affection of this animal,
which, he says, occurred near Chelmsford:—“A
she fox that had, as it should seem, but
one cub, was unkennelled by a gentleman’s
hounds, and hotly pursued. The poor animal,
braving every danger rather than leave
her cub behind to be worried by the dogs,
took it up in her mouth, and ran with it in
this manner for several miles. At last, taking
her way through a farmer’s yard, she was
assaulted by a mastiff, and at length obliged
to drop her cub; this was taken up by the
farmer.” And we are happy to add that the
affectionate creature escaped the pursuit, and
got off in safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all animals the fox has the most significant
eye, by which is expressed every passion
of love, fear, hatred, &amp;c. He is remarkably
playful, but, like all savage creatures
half reclaimed, will on the least offence bite
even those with whom he is most familiar.</p>

<p class='c006'>He is never to be fully tamed; he languishes
when deprived of liberty, and if kept
too long in a domestic state he dies of chagrin.
When abroad, he is often seen to amuse
himself with his fine bushy tail, running
sometimes for a considerable while in circles
to catch it. In cold weather he wraps it
about his nose.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the northern countries there is a black
fox, a variety of the common fox. The Kamschatdales
informed Dr. Grieve that these
were once so numerous with them that whenever
they fed their dogs, it was a difficult
piece of labour to prevent them from partaking.
The doctor says, that when he was in
Kamschatka, they were in such plenty near
the forts, that in the night they entered them
without any apparent apprehension of danger
from the dogs of the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the inhabitants, he informs us,
caught several of them in the pit where he
kept his fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mode usually adopted by the inhabitants
for taking them is by traps baited with
live animals; and, for the greater security,
two or three of these traps are placed upon
one hillock, that, whatever way the foxes approach,
they may fall into one of them. This
is found necessary, since those which have
been once in danger, ever afterwards go so
cautiously to work, as frequently to eat the
bait without being seized. But, with all their
cunning, when several traps are employed, it
is difficult for them to escape. Their skins

<p class='c006'><i>Foxes, Anecdotes of.</i>—Near the Falls of
Clyde, on the summit of an awful precipice,
a spot is shown where a fox once exhibited
extraordinary cunning. Being hard pressed
by the dogs, he seized in his teeth a fast hold
of some pendulous shrub growing on the
verge, threw himself across the brow of the
precipice, and after remaining there until the
scent was strong, he recovered the ground,
and jumped into an adjoining thicket. Three
couple of the leading hounds, in the eagerness
of pursuit, actually rushed over the bank, and
were dashed to atoms. It is said that the
fox escaped. The anecdote is told and credited
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The old Duke of Grafton had his hounds
at Croydon, and occasionally had foxes taken
in Whittlebury forest, and sent up in the
venison-cart to London; the foxes thus
brought, were carried the next hunting morning
in a hamper behind the duke’s carriage,
and turned down before the hounds. In the
course of this plan, a fox was taken from a
coppice in the forest, and forwarded as usual.
Some time after a fox was caught in the same
coppice, whose size and appearance was so
strikingly like that got at the same spot, that
the keepers suspected it was the fox they had
been in possession of before, and directed the
man who took him to London, to inquire
whether the fox hunted on such a day was
killed, or escaped; the latter having been
the case, the suspicion of the keepers was
strengthened. Some short time after, a fox
was again caught in the same coppice, which
those concerned in the taking were assured
was the fox they had bagged twice before; to
be, however, perfectly able to identify their
old acquaintance, should another opportunity
offer, previous to his third journey to town,
he had one ear slit, and some holes punched
through the other. With these marks he
was despatched to London, was again hunted,
and escaped, and within a very few weeks
was retaken in the same coppice; when his
marks justified the keeper’s conjectures, in
spite of the seeming improbability of the fact.
It is with some concern, that the conclusion
of this singular account is added, which terminates
in the death of poor reynard, who
was killed after a very severe chase, bearing
upon him the signals of his former escapes,
and which ought to have entitled him to that
lenity and privilege which was formerly
granted to a stag who had beat his royal
pursuers.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some curious instances have been related
to me of the cunning evinced by foxes, not
only in the preservation of their lives, but in
procuring themselves food. A fox, which had
been frequently hunted in Leicestershire, was
always lost at a particular place, where the
hounds could never recover the scent. This
circumstance having excited some curiosity, it
was discovered that he jumped upon, and ran
along a clipped hedge, at the end of which
was an old pollard oak tree, hollow in the
middle. He crept into this hollow, and lay
concealed till the alarm was over. His retreat,
however, being discovered, he was driven
from it and killed. Another fox selected a
magpie’s nest as a place of retreat, and was
discovered in consequence of a labouring man
having observed a quantity of bones, feathers
of birds, &amp;c., on the ground under the nest.
The following fact may be relied upon, extraordinary
as it may appear. I received it from
a gentleman of the strictest veracity, who
communicated it to me very recently, on his
return from the south of France, where he
had been residing for some months. A friend
of his, with whom he passed much of his
time there, was in the habit of shooting in a
part of the country where there was much
wild and rocky ground. Part of this rocky
ground was on the side of a very high hill,
which was not accessible for a sportsman, and
from which both hares and foxes took their
way in the evening to the plain below. There
were two channels or gullies made by the
rains, leading from these rocks to the lower
ground. Near one of these channels, the
sportsman in question, and his attendant, stationed
themselves one evening, in hopes of
being able to shoot some hares. They had
not been there long, when they observed a
fox coming down the gully, and followed by
another. After playing together for a little
time, one of the foxes concealed himself under
a large stone or rock, which was at the bottom
of the channel, and the other returned to the
rocks. He soon, however, came back, chasing
a hare before him. As the hare was passing
the stone where the first fox had concealed
himself, he tried to seize her by a sudden
spring, but missed his aim. The chasing fox
then came up, and finding that his expected
prey had escaped, through the want of skill in
his associate, he fell upon him, and they both
fought with so much animosity, that the parties
who had been watching their proceedings
came up and destroyed them both.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Stratagems of foxes to take water-fowl.</i>—Amongst
the devices of the fox to catch
his prey, is that of sliding under water like a
frog, only leaving his nostrils above the surface
to take breath, in such places as that described
by White, where he has observed
water-fowl resort. This appears to me to have
given origin to a curious legend which I have
traced to Albertus Magnus, the celebrated naturalist
of the middle ages. “When the
fox,” says he, “is troubled with gnats or fleas,
he taketh a mouthful of straw or soft hay, or
hair, and so goeth into the water, dipping his
hinder parts by little and little, then the insects
betake themselves to his head, which he
keepeth out of the water, which the fox feeling,
dippeth or diveth also the same under
water to his mouth, wherein he holdeth the
hay as aforesaid, whereunto the flies run for
sanctuary or dry refuge, which the fox perceiving,
suddenly casteth it out of his mouth,
and runneth out of the water, by this means
easing himself of all those enemies.”—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Buffon</i>—<i>White

<p class='c006'>The muzzle of the fox-hound is rather
long, and his head small in proportion to his
body; his ears long and pendulous, though
not so much as those of the blood-hound or
stag-hound. His legs are very straight, his
feet round and not too large, his chest deep,
and breast wide, his back broad, his neck thin,
his shoulders lie well back, his tail thick and
bushy, and carried high when in the chase.
His colour is generally white, variously patched
with black in different parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel makes the following remarks
on the choice of hounds. Most sportsmen
have their prejudices as to the colour of their
dogs. In an old distich it is said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So many men, so many minds,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So many hounds, so many kinds;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>and the choice of hounds in former times, as
to colour and other points, is no bad commentary
upon it; for we are gravely told, that
white coloured dogs, especially those that were
pupped without any spot upon them, although
not generally good for all sorts of game, were
excellent for the stag; that people from experience
valued them, because of their natural
instinct, being curious hunters, with admirable
noses, and very good at stratagems; and,
moreover, that they were less subject to diseases,
by reason of a predominancy of phlegm
which gave them a good temperament of
body.</p>

<p class='c006'>Black hounds were not to be rejected, especially
when marked with white and not
red spots, the whiteness proceeding from the
phlegmatic constitution, which was supposed
to ensure memory. They were at the same
time more obedient, and were said to be good
hunters, not frightened at water and so hardy
as seldom to require the doctor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Grey coloured hounds (supposing all suspicion
of mongrelism to be removed) were to
be coveted, on account of their cunning, never
faltering, nor being discouraged in their quest.
It is allowed that their noses were not the
best, but being indefatigable, they pushed
themselves forward; and it is presumed, from
the above failing, that nine times out of ten
they did more harm than good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yellow hounds, which are defined to be
those having red hair, inclining to brown, possess
too much choler to be much prized;
were too giddy and resolute to hunt any animals
that turned too much in their chase;
were with difficulty taught, and not easily corrected;
and, from their impatient temper,
which hurried them beyond their strength,
were very liable to diseases.</p>

<p class='c006'>No country in Europe can boast of fox-hounds
equal in swiftness, strength and agility,
to those of Britain, where the utmost attention
is paid to their breeding, education, and
food. The climate also seems congenial to
their nature; for, when taken to France or
Spain, and other southern countries of Europe,
they quickly degenerate, and lose all the admirable
qualities they possess in this country:</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is a trait in our national character to be
fond of hunting. It was the occupation of
our forefathers from the remotest posterity,
and seems to have descended, with even increased
ardour, down to the present day. Certainly
there is no country that can boast of
such expensive and convenient receptacles for
the maintenance of fox-hounds as Great Britain.
The kennel of the Duke of Richmond,
at Goodwood, cost 19,000<i>l.</i> and Mr. Noel’s
pack of hounds was sold to Sir William Lowther,
Bart. for the large sum of 1,000 guineas.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The chief excellence in a pack of fox-hounds
is the head they carry, taken collectively;
and on this and the fineness of their
noses depend their speed. Mr. Beckford says,
“that hounds should go, like the horses of
the sun, all abreast.” Five and twenty couple
are a sufficient force at any time to be taken
into the field; they are a match for any fox,
supposing them steady and their speed nearly
equal: too heavy dogs always do more mischief
than service. Hounds that are meant
to run well together should never have too
many old ones amongst them. Five or six
seasons are sufficient to destroy the speed of
most dogs, although this depends much on
constitution. We are informed of a spayed
bitch, called Lilly, which ran at the head of
Mr. Paxton’s harriers at Newmarket, for five
seasons; a singular instance of undiminished
speed.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Beckford</i>—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This effect of frost upon birds, took place
in February, 1809, when a boy in the service
of Mr. W. Newman, miller, at Legbourne,
near Malling, went into a field, called the
Forty Acres, and saw a number of rooks on
the ground, very close together. He made
a noise to drive them away, but they did not
appear alarmed; he threw snow-balls to make
them rise, still they remained. Surprised at
this apparent indifference, he went in among
them, and actually picked up twenty-seven
rooks, and also in several parts of the same
field, ninety larks, a pheasant, and a buzzard
hawk. The cause of the inactivity of the
birds, was a thing of rare occurrence in this
climate; a heavy rain fell on Thursday afternoon,
which, freezing as it came down, so completely
glazed over the bodies of the birds,
that they were fettered in a coat of ice, and
completely deprived of the power of motion.
Several of the larks were dead, having perished
from the intenseness of the cold. The buzzard
hawk being strong, struggled hard for his
liberty, broke his icy fetters, and effected his
escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birds of this species breed in the desert
marshes of the north, and remain there
throughout the spring and summer. On the
approach of winter they leave the European
and Siberian parts of Russia, Sweden, &amp;c.,
and, aided by the first strong north-east wind,
commonly make their appearance about the

return to their northern haunts. They are
very shy and wary birds, feeding only in the
night, and lurking concealed among the rushes
in the watery waste during the day, in which
they are seldom seen on the wing.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds show themselves expert in

<p class='c006'>Galls are lacerations occasioned by the too
tight pressure and friction of an uneasy and
ill-fitted saddle, or heavy harness. They
are seldom seen with either the judicious or
enlightened; experience having taught both
how to appreciate prevention. The prudent
sportsman will never take his horse to
the field, nor the humane driver his carriage-horse
to the road, till personal examination
has convinced him the necessary apparatus
is not only firm, but proportionably
easy; and this should become the more predominant
in memory because it is natural to
conclude, no man existing would, by neglect
or inattention, give pain to the very animal
from whose exertions he is to derive his own
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Injuries of this description, if unexpectedly
sustained, should be immediately attended to;
a repetition, and that so soon, upon the part
so injured, is frequently productive of trouble,
expense, loss of time, and disappointment.
When the side of a horse is galled, as it sometimes
is, by the girth buckle having been most
improperly placed upon the edge of the pad,
it is not unlikely, for want of early or proper
attention, to terminate in a sitfast, and then
can only be completely cured by extirpation
with the knife. The withers being affected
in the same way, and the saddle, or harness,
continued in use, by which the injury is originally
occasioned, the foundation of fistula
may be laid, and will be likely to ensue. In
all slight and superficial galls, two or three
moistenings of the part with cold vinegar, will
allay the inflammation, and harden the surface;
but where the long-continued heat and
friction has occasioned a destruction of parts,
it must be dressed and managed as a wound,
which can only be completely cured by incarnation.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gallinaceous Birds</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>A large portion of these seem to have left
their native woods to crowd around the dwellings
of man, where, subservient to his purpose,
they subsist upon the pickings of the
farm-yard, the stable, or the dung-hill; a
cheerful, active race, which enliven and adorn
the rural scene, and require no other care
than the fostering hand of the house-wife to
shelter and protect them. Some kinds, such
as the partridge, the pheasant, and the like,
are found only in cultivated places, at no
great distance from the habitations of men;
and, although they have not submitted to his
dominion, they are nevertheless subject to his
controlling power, and are the objects of his
keenest pursuit: whilst others, taking a wider
range, find food and shelter in the deepest recesses
of the woods and forests, sometimes
subsisting upon wild and heathy mountains,
or among rocks and precipices the most difficult
of access.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters of the gallinaceous genus
are generally well known: most of the species
are distinguished above all others for the
whiteness of their flesh; their bodies are
large and bulky, and their heads comparatively
small; the bill in all of them is short,
strong and somewhat curved; their wings are
short and concave, and scarcely able to support
their bodies, on which account they seldom
make long excursions: their legs are
strong, and are furnished with a spur or a
knob behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birds of this kind are extremely prolific
and lay a great number of eggs: the young
follow the mother as soon as hatched, and
immediately learn to pick up the food, which
she is most assiduous in showing them; on
this account she generally makes her nest on
the ground, or in places easy of access to her
young brood.</p>

<p class='c006'>The habitudes of the domestic breed of
poultry cannot possibly escape observation;
and every one must have noticed the fierce
jealousy of the cock. It should seem that
this jealousy is not confined to his rivals, but
may sometimes extend to his beloved female;
and that he is capable of being actuated by
revenge, founded on some degree of reasoning
concerning her conjugal infidelity. An incident
which happened at the seat of Mr. B——,
near Berwick, justifies this remark. “My
mowers,” says he, “cut a partridge on her
nest, and immediately brought the eggs (fourteen)
to the house. I ordered them to be
put under a very large beautiful hen, and her
own to be taken away. They were hatched
in two days, and the hen brought them up
perfectly well till they were five or six weeks
old. During that time they were constantly
kept confined in an outhouse, without having
been seen by any of the other poultry. The
door happened to be left open, and the cock
got in. My housekeeper, hearing her in distress,
ran to her assistance, but did not arrive
in time to save her life; the cock, finding her
with the brood of partridges, fell upon her
with the utmost fury, and put her to death.
The housekeeper found him tearing her
both with his beak and spurs, although she
was then fluttering in the last agony, and
incapable of any resistance. The hen had
been, formerly, the cock’s greatest favourite.”—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

to part. Legs long, naked above the knee;
three toes before and one behind, the fore
toes long, divided, and furnished with a very
narrow border. Wings of middle size, the first
quill shorter than the second and third, which
are the longest in the wing. The latter does
not hold in some foreign species.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Gallop is one pace of the horse, well known
by that general name; though it will admit
of gradational distinctions. A canter is the
slowest gallop, in which a horse bears most
upon his haunches, but lightly on the bit: it
is a pace which spirited good-tempered horses
seem to enjoy, and is peculiarly calculated for
the accommodation of a lady. A rating gallop
is the increase of action to such pace as the
peculiar horse may or can go with ease at his
rate in common strokes, without being exerted
to speed; and this is the hunting gallop of
thorough-bred horses, who will always lay by
the side of hounds at it, without being in the
least distressed. A brushing gallop upon the
turf, implies an increased degree of velocity,
but not equal to utmost speed.—<i>Taplin.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Galloway is the name given to that useful

hands high; they are rarely to be seen of exact
symmetry, uniform strength, and adequate action;
but, if well bred, their qualifications
and endurance of fatigue exceed description.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gambet</span>, (<i>Fringa Gambetta</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Gambette</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>) <i>s.</i> A bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the Chevalier Rouge of Brisson,
and the Red-legged Horseman of Albin. For
want of a specimen of this bird, the following
description is borrowed from Latham:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Size of the Greenshank: length twelve
inches, bill of a reddish colour, with a black
tip; the irides yellowish green; head, back,
and breast cinereous brown, spotted with dull
yellow; wing coverts and scapulars cinereous,
edged with dull yellow; prime quills
dusky; shaft of the first white; tail dusky,
bordered with yellow; legs yellow. This inhabits
England, but is not common; has been
shot on the coast of Lincolnshire. Known in
France; but is there a rare bird. Has a note
not unlike the whistle of a woodcock; and
the flesh is esteemed. Inhabits Scandinavia
and Iceland; called in the last Stelkr. It
has also been taken in the Frozen Sea between
Asia and America.”—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gambrel</span>, <i>s.</i> The hind leg of a horse.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Game</span>, <i>s.</i> Sport of any kind; jest, opposed to earnest; merriment; a single
match at play; field sports, as the chase; animals pursued in the
field.</p>

<p class='c006'>In choosing game, young birds may be distinguished
by the softness of their quills,
which in older ones will be hard and white.
The females are, in general, preferable to the
males; they are more juicy, and seldom so
tough. For example, a hen pheasant or a
duck is to be preferred to a cock pheasant or
mallard. The old pheasants may be distinguished
by the length and sharpness of their
spurs, which, in the younger ones, are short
and blunt. Old partridges are always to be
known, during the early part of the season,
by their legs being a pale blue, instead of a
yellowish brown; so that, when a Londoner
receives his brace of blue-legged birds in September,
he should immediately snap their
legs, and draw out the sinews, by means of
pulling off the feet, instead of leaving them
to torment him, like so many strings, when
he would be wishing to enjoy his repast.
This remedy of making the leg tender removes
the objection to old birds, provided the weather
will admit of their being sufficiently
kept; and indeed they are then often preferable,
from having a higher flavour.</p>

<p class='c006'>If birds are overkept their legs will be dry,
their eyes much sunk, and the vent will become
soft and somewhat discoloured. The
first place to ascertain if they are beginning to
be high is the inside of their bills, where it is
not amiss to put some heather straw or spice,
if you want them to keep for any length of
time. Birds that have fallen in the water,
or have not had time to get cold, should never
be packed like others, but sent openly, and
dressed as soon as possible.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A peculiar culinary mode of perfuming
their birds was observed at the table of the
King of Tunis, who landed at Naples to have
an interview with Charles the Emperor.
They were stuffed with odoriferous drugs and
spices to such an expense, that the cooking of
one peacock and two pheasants, dressed after
this fashion, amounted to a hundred ducats,
and when they were carved, not only the dining-room,
but all the apartments of his palace,
and even the adjoining streets, were filled with
the aromatic vapour, which was not presently
dispersed.—<i>Hawker</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gamecock</span>, <i>s.</i> A cock bred to fight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Game-egg</span>, <i>s.</i> An egg from which fighting cocks are bred.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gamefowl</span>, <i>s.</i> Game cocks and hens.</p>

<p class='c006'>Game fowls are too well known to require
a particular description. Their plumage, particularly
the red, is most beautiful and rich;
their size somewhat below the common, and
their symmetry and delicacy of limbs to be
compared with those of the race-horse and
the deer, or in more strict analogy, with the
wild species of their own genus. The ancients
kept gamecocks for the same purpose
as the moderns, and there is a game breed at
present existing in India; but I have not
hitherto obtained any information as to the
origin of our game breed, which has been
established during many centuries in this
country. Their flesh is of the most beautiful
white, and superior to that of all other breeds
of domestic fowls, for richness and delicacy
of flavour; but the extreme difficulty of
rearing the chickens, from their natural pugnacity
of disposition, which shows itself at
the earliest possible period, deters most breeders,
excepting those who breed for the cock-pit.
I have many times had whole broods,
scarcely feathered, stone-blind from fighting,
to the very smallest individuals; these rival
couples moping in corners, and renewing their
battles on obtaining the first ray of light. On
this account few can be reared, and as this
disposition, to a certain degree, prevails in the
half-bred, it prevents crossing with the game
cock, otherwise a great improvement. The
game eggs are smaller than common, finely
shaped, and extremely delicate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Philanthropists are in the habit of declaiming
much against the practice of cock-pit battles,
but, on reflection, the cruelty of that
sport will be found among the least, wherein
the feelings of animals are concerned; since
fighting, in the gamecock, is a natural and
irresistible passion, and can never take place
against his will; and since those engaged in
regular combat upon the arena would do so
voluntarily, and with equal ardour, did they
meet in the desert. Another and similar
mistake is the supposed additional cruelty of
arming the heels of the cock with steel,
which, on the contrary, conduces to shorten
the period of their sufferings.—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Game-laws</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Hares may be killed at any time of the

of September to the 1st of February; penalty
for killing them at other times 5<i>l.</i> Grouse
from the 12th of August to the 10th of

for the third and every subsequent offence
50<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>An unqualified person, killing, can only be
convicted of one penalty in a day. That is,
an unqualified person, or even a poacher,
would have no more to pay for killing fifty
head of game in the same day, than he would
for killing one. Though the poacher, or unqualified
person, would be liable to the other
penalties, viz. 5<i>l.</i> each for every head of game
which he sold, offered for sale, or which had
even been found in his possession; and if a dog
or gun (or any other engine) was used in the
destruction of game, he would also be liable
to 20<i>l.</i> penalty, provided he had not taken
out a sporting certificate.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a person go in pursuit of game with a
dog and gun, he can only be charged with
one offence, and convicted in one penalty for
both. (7 Term Reports, 152.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Killing from seven o’clock at night to six
in the morning, between the 12th of October
and 12th of February, and from nine at night
to four in the morning, from the 12th of February
to the 12th of October, (besides the
other penalties before named) first offence,
not more than 20<i>l.</i> nor less than 10<i>l.</i>; second
offence from 30<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i>; third and subsequent,
50<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Servant of a lord of a manor may kill,
and yet the lord of the manor may not, unless
he is qualified.</p>

<p class='c006'>Informations for penalties, relative to the
game laws, should be brought so far as the
conviction to take place within three months.</p>

<p class='c006'>A penalty may be either recovered by information
before a justice of peace, or sued
for in any of the courts of record at Westminster.
In the latter case, the action must
be brought within six months after the offence
committed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rabbits, woodcocks, snipes, quails, and
landrails, are made game only so far as relates
to shooting them, for which, therefore, a certificate
is required; but one without a certificate
may catch, sell, or have them in his
possession.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gannet is generally about seven pounds
in weight, three feet in length, and six in
breadth. The bill is of a pale or lead-coloured
blue, six inches long, a little jagged on the
edges, strong and straight to the tip, which is
inclined a little downwards; the upper bill
is furnished with a distinct rib or ridge, running
along from the tip nearly to its base, on
each side of which it is furrowed, without any
visible appearance of nostrils; the tongue is
small, and placed far within the mouth, all
the inside of which is black; a darkish line
passes from the brow over the eyes, which are
surrounded with a naked blue skin, and, like
those of the owl, are set in the head so as to
look nearly straight forward, and the extreme
paleness of the irides gives them a keen wild
stare. The gape of the mouth is very wide,
and seems more lengthened by a slip of naked
black skin, which is extended on each side
from the corners beyond the cheeks; these
features of its countenance, altogether give it
the appearance of wearing spectacles. A loose
black, bare, dilatable skin, capable of great
distension, hung from the blades of the under
bill, and extended over the throat, serves it
as a pouch to carry provisions to its mate or
its young. The body is flat and well clothed
with feathers; the neck long; the crown of
the head, nape, and, in some specimens, the
hinder part of the neck, are of a buff colour;
greater quills and bastard wings black, and
the rest of the plumage white. The tail is
wedge-shaped, and consists of twelve tapering
sharp-pointed feathers, the middle ones the
longest. The legs and feet are nearly of the
same colour and conformation as those of the
cormorant, but they are curiously marked by
a pea-green stripe, which runs down each
shin, and branches off along every one of the
toes. The male and female are nearly alike,
but the young birds, during the first year, appear
as if they were of a distinct species, for
their plumage is then of a dusky colour,
speckled all over with triangular white spots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes her nest in the caverns
and fissures, or on the ledges of the lowering
precipice, as well as on the plain surface of
the ground; it is formed of a great quantity
of withered grasses and sea-weeds of various
kinds, gathered with much labour from the
barren soil, or picked up floating about upon
the water. She lays three eggs, of a white
colour, and somewhat less than those of a
goose, although ornithologists assert that she
will lay only one egg, if left to herself undisturbed,
and that when this egg is taken away
she then lays a second, and in like manner a
third, which she is generally permitted to
hatch, and rear the young one.</p>

<p class='c006'>The male and female hatch and fish by
turns; the fisher returns to the nest with five
or six herrings in its gorget, all entire and undigested,
which the hatcher pulls out from the
throat of its provider, and swallows them,
making at the same time a loud noise.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are common on the coasts of
Norway and Iceland, and are said to be met
with in great numbers about New Holland,
and New Zealand; they breed also on the
coasts of Newfoundland, and migrate southward
along the American shores as far as
South Carolina; they are noticed, indeed, by
navigators, as being met with, dispersed over
both hemispheres, which are probably one
great family spread over the whole globe;
but their greatest known rendezvous is the
Hebrides and other solitary rocky isles of
North Britain, where their nests, in the
months of May and June, are described as so
closely placed together, that it is difficult to
walk without treading upon some of them;
and it is said that the swarms of the old birds
are so prodigious, that when they rise into the
air, they stun the ear with their noise, and
overshadow the ground like the clouds.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the small island of Borea, Martin says,
“The heavens were darkened by those flying
above our heads; their excrements were in
such quantity, that they gave a tincture to
the sea, and at the same time sullied our boat
and clothes.” Besides this small island of
Borea, and St. Kila, noticed by Martin, Pennant
and other writers mention the isle of
Ailsa, in the Frith of Clyde; the Stack of
Souliskerry, near the Orkneys; the Skellig
Isles, off the coast of Kerry, Ireland; and the
Bass Isle, in the Frith of Forth. This last-mentioned
isle is farmed out at a considerable
rent, for the eggs of the various kinds of
water-fowl with which it swarms; and the
produce of the solan geese forms a large portion
of this rent; for great numbers of their
young ones are taken every season, and sold
in Edinburgh for about twenty-pence each,
where they are esteemed a favourite dish,
being generally roasted, and eaten before dinner.
On the other bleak and bare isles, the
inhabitants, during a great part of the year,
depend for their support on these birds and
their eggs, which are taken in amazing quantities,
and are the principal articles of their
food. From the nests placed upon the ground
the eggs are easily picked up one after another,
in great numbers, as fast as they are laid; but
in robbing the nests built in the precipices,
chiefly for the sake of the birds, the business
wears a very different aspect: there, before
the dearly earned booty can be secured, the
adventurous fowler, trained to it from his
youth, and familiarised to the danger, must
first approach the brow of the fearful precipice,
to view and to trace his progress on the
broken pendent rocks beneath him: over
these rocks, which (perhaps a hundred fathoms
lower) are dashed by the foaming surge, he is
from a prodigious height about to be suspended.
After addressing himself in prayer
to the Supreme Disposer of events, with a
mind prepared for the arduous task, he is let
down by a rope, either held fast by his comrades,
or fixed into the ground on the summit,
with his single cord, his pole-net, his pole-hook,
&amp;c.; and thus equipped, he is enabled,
in his progress, either to stop, to ascend or
descend, as he sees occasion. Sometimes by
swinging himself from one ledge to another,
with the help of his hook, he mounts upwards,
and clambers from place to place; and, at
other opportunities, by springing backwards,
he can dart himself into the hollow caverns
of the projecting rock, which he commonly
finds well stored with the objects of his pursuit,
whence the plunder, chiefly consisting of
the full-grown young birds, is drawn up to
the top, or tossed down to the boat at the
bottom, according to the situation, or concurring
circumstances of time and place. In
these hollows he takes his rest, and sometimes
remains during the night, especially
when they happen to be at such vast and stupendous
heights. To others of less magnitude
the fowlers commonly climb from the bottom,
with the help of their hooked poles only, by
which they assist, and push or pull up each
other from hold to hold, and in this manner
traverse the whole front of the frightful scar.
To a feeling mind the very sight of this
hazardous employment, in whatever way it is
pursued, is painful; for, indeed, it often happens
that these adventurous poor men, in this
life-taking mode of obtaining their living, slip
their hold, are precipitated from one projection
to another, with increasing velocity, and fall
mangled upon the rocks, or are for ever buried
in the abyss beneath.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species, which is only a little bigger
than the teal, is clothed with an elegant plumage,
and has altogether a most agreeable and
sprightly look. It measures about seventeen
inches in length, and twenty-eight in
breadth. The bill is of a dark lead colour,
nearly black; the irides light hazel. From
the crown of the head, over the nape of the
neck downwards, it is of a glossy brown, chin
black; brow, cheeks, and the upper fore part
of the neck, reddish chestnut, with vinous reflections,
and sprinkled all over with numerous
small pointed white lines. A white stripe
passes over each eye, and slanting backwards,
falls down on each side of the neck, the lower
part of which, with the breast, is light brown,
pretty closely crossed with semicircular bars
of black; the shoulders and back are marked
nearly the same, but on a darker ground: the
scapulars are long and narrow, and are striped
with ash-colour, black, and white. The belly
in some, is white; in others, pale reddish yellow;
the lower part of it, and the vent, mottled
with dusky spots; the sides are freckled
and waved with narrow lines of ash-coloured
brown, more and more distinctly marked towards
the thighs; behind which, this series of
feathers terminates in a riband, striped with
ash, black, white, and lead-coloured blue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The coverts of the wings are of an agreeable
bluish ash, margined with white; next to this,
the exterior webs of the middle quills are
glossy green, tipped with white, and form the
beauty-spot or spangle of the wings, to which
the white tips make a border; the primary
quills are ash-brown, edged with white; tail
dusky; legs lead colour. The foregoing description
was taken from a male bird in full
and perfect plumage. This sex is furnished
with a labyrinth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female has an obscure white mark
over each eye; the rest of the plumage is of
a brownish ash colour, not unlike the female
teal; but the wing wants the green spot, which
sufficiently distinguishes these birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>A full-grown male gaunt weighs between
two and three pounds; length about two feet.
The bill is two inches and three quarters long,
dusky brown along the ridge of the upper
mandible and at the point; the rest reddish
flesh-colour; irides and lore crimson. The
head is much enlarged by a crest of a dusky
colour, standing up on each side; the cheeks
and throat are surrounded by long feathers of
a ferruginous colour; from the bill to the eye
is a black line, above which is a white one;
the chin is white; the hind part of the neck,
and upper part of the body and wings, dusky
brown; the under part of the neck, breast,
and all beneath, beautiful glossy white; the
primary quill-feathers dusky; some of the inner
ones tipped with white, the rest are nearly
all white, which, when the wing is closed,
makes an oblique bar of that colour across it;
legs dusky on the outside; some wholly dusky
green.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is indigenous to England; it breeds
in the meres of Shropshire and Cheshire, and
in the fens of Lincolnshire. The nest is large,
composed of a variety of aquatic plants; it is
not attached to any thing, but floats amongst
the reeds and flags, penetrated by the water.

<p class='c006'>Castration has a strange effect: it emasculates
both man, beast, and bird, and brings
them to a near resemblance of the other sex.
Thus eunuchs have smooth unmuscular arms,
thighs, and legs; and broad hips, and beardless
chins, and squeaking voices. Gelt-stags
and bucks have hornless heads, like hinds and
does. Thus wethers have small horns, like
ewes; and oxen large bent horns, and hoarse
voices when they low, like cows; for bulls
have short straight horns; and though they
mutter and grumble in a deep tremendous
tone, yet they low in a shrill high key. Capons
have small combs and gills, and look pallid
about the head like pullets; they also walk
without any parade, and hover chickens like
hens. Barrow-hogs have also small tusks like
sows.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus far it is plain that it puts a stop to the
growth of those appendages that are looked
upon as its insignia. But the ingenious Mr.
Lisle, in his book on husbandry, carries it
much farther; for he says, that the loss of those
insignia alone has sometimes a strange effect:
he had a boar so fierce and amorous, that to
prevent mischief, orders were given for his
tusks to be broken off. No sooner had the
beast suffered this injury than his powers forsook
him, and he neglected those females to
whom before he was passionately attached, and
from whom no fences could restrain him.—<i>White

<p class='c006'>Those who live in or near London may buy
them in proper condition for the day on which
they wish to use them, but for the accommodation
of those who reside in the country, remote
from such convenience, the best modes
of breeding them will be here mentioned, in
order to prevent disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coarse fish, such as chub and roach, may be
laid in an earthen pot in the shade, and will
soon be fly-blown. When the gentles are of a
proper size (but not before), put some oatmeal
and bran to them, and in two days they will
be well scoured and fit to fish with, in about
four more they become hard, assume a pale red
colour, and soon after change to flies. The red
ones should not be thrown away, as frequently
roach and dace take these with a white one
in preference to all other baits. Some have
recommended a piece of liver suspended by a
stick over a barrel of clay, into which the gentles
fall and cleanse themselves; but clay will
not scour them, and besides they fall from the
liver before they have attained their full size.
The aforementioned is a less disgusting plan;
for a short time after oatmeal and bran are put
to the gentles the fish in which they are bred
will be found perfect skeletons, and may be
thrown away. However, if they are to be bred
from liver, it should be scarified deeply in
many parts, and then hung up and nearly covered
over, as in that way the flies will blow
it better than when wholly exposed; in two or
three days the gentles will be seen alive. The
liver is then to be put into an earthen pan and
there remain until the first brood are of full
growth, a sufficient quantity of fine sand and
bran (letting the liver remain) is then to be
put into the pan, and in a few days they will
come from the flesh, and scour themselves in
it. The liver should then be hung across the
pan and the latter brood will soon drop out and
be fit for use; and by thus breeding them in
October, and keeping them a little warmer than
those bred in summer, until they arrive at
their full growth, and afterwards putting them
in the same pan into a dampish vault, they may
be preserved for winter fishing.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>I consider ginger as the most useful stimulant
in the veterinary materia medica: when
joined with aromatics, such as allspice, caraway
seed, aniseed, cummin seed, &amp;c., or their
essential oils, it forms an efficacious cordial,
and with emetic tartar and opium an excellent
diaphoretic, for giving gloss to the coat, and
relaxing the skin. Joined with bitters, it
makes a good stomachic; with squills an expectorant,
often relieving obstinate coughs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ginger is extremely beneficial in weakness

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Glanders</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease incident to horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a contagious disorder, and one that
is generally thought incurable. The great
number of horses that have been destroyed by
glanders, especially in the army, and in establishments
where great numbers of horses are
kept, has excited particular attention to the
subject, especially in France and Italy, where
many attempts were made, in the beginning of
the last century, to discover a remedy for it.
Lafosse, an eminent French veterinarian, considered
it as a local disease, and thought he
had discovered a successful mode of treating it,
which consisted in perforating the bones which
cover the frontal and nasal sinuses, and injecting
through the openings astringent and other
liquids. After this opinion had been published,
some English farriers made trial of it, and by
others detergent lotions were poured into the
nostrils; the nose being drawn up for the purpose
by means of a pulley. Attempts were
also made to cure it by arsenical fumigations,
and by burning out the swollen glands under
the jaws, or sloughing them out by caustics.
The various preparations of mercury, copper,
iron, and arsenic, have likewise been tried, and
after all the general opinion is that the glanders
is incurable.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the glanders is contagious has been
clearly and indisputably proved by numerous
experiments; and the manner in which it is
propagated has likewise been satisfactorily demonstrated.
At the same time it is generally
believed that the glanders takes place also independent
of contagion; but from what causes
or circumstances it is then produced, no author
has attempted to state precisely.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been said, in a general way, that close
unwholesome stables, hard work, and bad provender,
sudden changes from cold and wet
weather to hot close stables, hard work, and
insufficient keep, and, in short, any thing that
will weaken the animal considerably, is likely
to produce glanders or farcy. Hence post and
stage horses are particularly obnoxious to this
disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Russel, of Exeter, had, for many years,
some glandered teams of horses constantly
working from Plymouth to Exeter. But they
were worked with moderation, well fed, and
taken great care of. I attended these teams
for several years, the horses generally looked
well, and in excellent condition. Many of
them lasted four or five years; and some fell
off after a few months.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of glanders are—1st, A discharge
of glairy matter from one or both nostrils;
generally from one only, and more frequently
from the left than from the right nostril.
2d, A swelling of the glands or kernels
under the jaw, or between the branches of the
lower jaw, and generally on the side of the jaw
corresponding with the affected nostril. In all
other respects the animal is generally in health,
and often sleek and in good condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes, however, the glanders is accompanied
by a disorder of the skin, named farcy,
and then the horse’s general health is often
affected. Farcy has been considered, by many
authors, as a distinct disorder. I have therefore
noticed it in a separate article (see Farcy),
though of opinion that it is always a symptom
of glanders, whether it appear in a local, or in
a constitutional form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glanders has been divided into two stages,
the acute and the chronic, or the first and second
stage. The acute glanders is generally
attended with acute farcy, such as chancrous
ulceration about the lips, face, or neck, with
considerable and painful swellings on different
parts, some of the swellings appearing as a corded
vein: ulceration and swelling of the hind
leg or sheath, or testicles, and sometimes of the
fore leg, with corded veins, and farcy buds on
the inside of the limb. The acute glanders
often spreads rapidly, and either destroys the
animal, or renders him such a pitiable and
hopeless object, that the proprietor is generally
induced to have him knocked on the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chronic glanders is generally very mild in
the first stage of the disorder, and does not affect
the appetite, or the general health and appearance
of the animal. Such horses, when
properly fed and taken care of, and worked
with moderation, will often continue in regular
work for several years.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been in the habit of attending several
teams of glandered horses since I left the army,
and have known them last four or five years.
Sometimes, however, they would go off in a
few months; and whenever a glandered horse
fell off much, and became unequal to his work,
he was destroyed. Many glandered horses
have been known to get rid of the disorder
while working in these teams; and sound horses
that have been put in occasionally, to fill up
the teams, especially old horses, have escaped
the disorder. It is this circumstance, as I have
before stated, that has led many to believe that
the glanders is not contagious.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second stage of glanders is marked by
ulceration within the nostrils, or an appearance
in the matter which indicates ulceration,
though sometimes too high up to be seen.
The matter is in larger quantity, more glutinous,
sticking about the margin of the nostril
and upper lips, and sometimes obstructing
the passage of air, so that the horse makes a
snuffling noise in breathing. The matter is
sometimes streaked with blood, and the horse
sometimes bleeds from the nostrils in working.
When this happens in the first stage of
the disorder, however early it may be, it indicates
the approach of the second stage. The
matter begins to have an offensive smell,
which it scarcely ever has in the first stage,
though an offensive smell is by many supposed
to be a decisive mark of glanders. In
the second stage the matter generally runs
from both nostrils; the glands under the jaw
become larger, harder, and fixed more closely
to the jaw-bone. They are also generally
more tender than in the first stage; the inner
comers of the eyes are mattery. The horse
loses flesh and strength, stales more than
usual, coughs, and at length dies in a miserable
condition, generally farcied as well as
glandered. It is with this disease as it was
formerly with small pox inoculation, and is
now with vaccination. If a person happens
to meet with one or two cases, or suppose it
were half a dozen, of a horse escaping the
glanders after standing in a stable with one
that is glandered, he thinks himself fully
warranted in concluding that the disease is
not contagious. Satisfied with this decision,
he gives himself no further trouble about it,
and pays no attention to any thing that may
be said or written in opposition to his own
opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a remarkable circumstance, that glanders
cannot be communicated by applying the
matter which is discharged from the nose of a
glandered horse to the nostrils of a sound
horse, even though a piece of lint soaked in
the matter be put up the nostrils, and kept in
contact with the pituitary membrane for a
short time; or even if the matter be thrown
up the nostrils with a syringe. But, if the
smallest quantity of matter be applied in the
way of inoculation, either to the membrane of
the nostrils, or to any part of the body, a
glanderous ulcer will be produced, from which
farcy buds and corded lymphatics will proceed.
After a few weeks the poison will get
into the circulation, and the horse will be
completely glandered. The circumstance of
glanders not being communicated by applying
matter to the nostril, enables us to account
for a horse escaping the disorder, as he sometimes
does, after being put into a glandered
stable, or standing by the side of a glandered
horse. I believe, however, that glanders is
frequently communicated by (accidental) inoculation;
and that there is only one other
way in which it can be communicated, that is,
by swallowing the matter which flows from
the nose of a glandered horse.—<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Blaine</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>A horse affected with glanders may inoculate
himself, and thereby produce the farcy. I
have known this happen to a horse while at
grass. The horse had an itching in his hind
leg, which led him to rub and bite the part,
and, at the same time, rub on it the glanderous
matter which flowed from his nostril.
The possibility of this circumstance taking
place may be easily proved by inoculating a
glandered horse, in any part of his body, with
some of his own matter. There are many
ways in which a sound horse may be accidentally
inoculated with the matter of glanders, for the
slightest scratch in any part of the body is
sufficient. Horses that are cleaned with a
curry comb are very liable to be scratched in
those parts where the bones are prominent,
such as the inside of the hock or knee, the
shank bones and the head. To such scratches
glanderous matter may be applied by the
hands of the groom after he has been examining
the nose of a glandered horse, or wiping
off the matter from his nostrils; or by the
horse himself transferring glanderous matter
from the nose of a diseased horse, or from the
manger, or other part where any matter has
been deposited, for horses are very fond of
rubbing their noses against the manger or
stall, and a glandered horse will generally
try to rub off the matter from his nose
against the manger, the rack, the stall, or
against another horse; and if a sound horse
happen to stand by one that is glandered,
they will often be seen nabbing or gently
biting each other, or rubbing noses. In short,
having proved that glanders is thus communicated,
we can conceive a variety of ways in
which a horse may be accidentally inoculated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reader may form some idea of the extent
of such losses when informed that large
inn-keepers have been nearly ruined by them.
I had occasion to condemn eight horses at one
time, in one establishment, which, added to
those already lost, amounted in value to five
hundred pounds. In one regiment fifty glandered
horses were shot in one day. The
twenty-third French dragoons, when quartered
in Italy, in March, 1809, had seventy-six
horses at one time affected with glanders and
farcy, or suspected of being so affected.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I have demonstrated the manner in
which glanders is communicated, it is needless
to say any thing of the mode of prevention,
except briefly observing, that it can only be
accomplished by preventing any glanderous
matter from coming near a horse, or mixing
with his food or water; and that the only
method of purifying an infected stable, is to
remove every thing on which glanderous matter
may have fallen, and to wash and scrape
the fixtures, such as the rack and manger,
thoroughly. I have in a former edition advised
a fumigation with the gas which arises
from a mixture of common salt, manganese,
and oil of vitriol; because I have found that
glanderous matter which has been exposed to
this gas is rendered quite innocent, though an
ass be inoculated with it; and I have directed
the stable to be first thoroughly cleansed, because
if any dry hard glanderous matter should
remain, the water employed in cleansing the
stable will have moistened it, and thereby enable
the fumigation to mix with it, and destroy
its poisonous quality.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Buffon enumerates eight species of this
division of the scolopax genus, under the
name of barges, including the foreign kinds;
and Latham makes out the same number of
different sorts, all British. They are a timid,
shy, and solitary tribe; their mode of subsistence
constrains them to spend their lives
amidst the fens, searching for their food in
the mud and wet soil, where they remain
during the day, shaded and hidden among
reeds and rushes, in that obscurity which their
timidity makes them prefer. They seldom
remain above a day or two in the same place,
and it often happens that in the morning not
one is to be found in those marshes where
they were numerous the evening before. They
remove in a flock in the night, and when there
is moonlight, may be seen and heard passing
at a vast height.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their bills are long and slender, and, like
the common snipe’s, are smooth and blunt at
the tip; their legs are of various colours, and
long. When pursued by the sportsman, they
run with great speed, are very restless, and
spring at a great distance, and make a scream
as they rise. Their voice is somewhat extraordinary,
and has been compared to the smothered
bleating of a goat. They delight in
salt marshes, and are rare in countries remote
from the sea. Their flesh is delicate and excellent
food.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Common Godwit</i>, <i>Godwyn</i>, <i>Yarnhelp</i>
or <i>Yarnhip</i>.—(<i>Scolopax ægocephala</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>La grande Barge Grise</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)</p>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this bird is about twelve
ounces; length about sixteen inches; the bill
is four inches long, and bent a little upwards,
black at the point, gradually softening into a
pale purple towards the base; a whitish streak
passes from the bill over each eye; the head,
neck, back, scapulars, and coverts, are of a
dingy pale brown, each feather marked down
the middle with a dark spot. The fore part
of the breast is streaked with black; the
belly, vent, and tail, are white, the latter
regularly barred with black; the webs of the
first six quill feathers are black, edged on the
interior sides with reddish brown; the legs
are in general dark coloured, inclining to a
greenish blue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The godwit is met with in various parts of
Europe, Asia, and America; in Great Britain,
in the spring and summer, it resides in the
fens and marshes, where it rears its young,
and feeds upon small worms and insects.
During these seasons it only removes from
one marsh to another; but when the winter
sets in with severity, it seeks the salt marshes
and the seashore.</p>

<p class='c006'>The godwit is much esteemed by epicures
as a great delicacy, and sells very high. It is
caught in nets, to which it is allured by a
stale or stuffed bird, in the same manner, and
in the same season, as the ruffs and reeves.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gold</span>, <i>s.</i> The purest, heaviest, and most precious of all metals; money.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye fine bright Gold Colours.</i>—First
dye a very bright yellow with turmeric, lift
out your stuff, and add a teaspoonful of madder;
return it, and boil it about three minutes,
and draw a part for the first shade; then put
in a tablespoonful of turmeric, boil it up
smartly; lift out your stuff and add better
than a teaspoonful of madder; put it into
the pot again, and boil it about seven minutes,
and draw the second shade. For the third
do the same, only adding some turmeric as
before, and two teaspoonfuls of madder; or,
if you see there is not a proper difference
between the shades, add more madder, boil
the wool in this ten minutes, and draw for
the third shade. Add more turmeric, and
three or four more teaspoonfuls of madder, or
more, till you bring it near to a blood orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lightest of these shades mixes the olive
camel, the second the light rail, the third the
dark rail and brown coughlan, and the fourth
mixes the golden sooty. This is the best way
to dye gold colours. Any man who is not a
regular dyer can only be called a fancy dyer,
and therefore can give no regular rules. If
you are a judge of these colours, you will
know by your eye when you get the proper
shade. If the first two of them should not
be enough of the gold, add more madder by
pinches, lest you should overpower it. Divide
each shade of the colours into two parts,
for fine olives, bordering on muscle’s-beard.
Put down a clean vessel with clean water, and
put your lightest shade into it, first boiling in
it about the size of a horse-bean of copperas.
Throw in your stuff, be smart in passing it
under your liquor, and in an instant you have
a fine golden olive. Put in the size of a pea
more of copperas, and put your next shade,
and so on till all is done. You are to put in
as much as two peas in the last. A little of
the dark shade helps the March olive camel,
and I have mixed out of these, with a little
brown sable, a very good olive camel. All
turmeric dyes, when put with binding stuff,
stand well. Be careful your turmeric and
madder be sound, if not, all is lost. Sound
turmeric is very bright, and of a sweet smell.
Sound madder is of an oily feel and a sweet
smell, and is bright in colour; that which
resembles brick-dust is bad, and gives no
colour. The madder that is the best may be
discovered easily by the taste.—<i>Ancient

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Golden Eagle.</span> <i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Eagle</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The golden eagle is said to be not unfrequent
in the mountainous parts of Ireland and
Scotland. It breeds in the most inaccessible
rocks, and lays three or four white eggs,
Selby says two, of a greyish white colour,
clouded with spots of reddish brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith, in the History of Kerry, says, a
poor man in that county got a comfortable
subsistence for his family, during a summer of
famine, out of an eagle’s nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pennant informs us it is frequent in Scotland,
and adds, that it is very destructive to
deer, which it will seize between the horns,
and, by incessantly beating it with its wings,
soon makes a prey of the harassed animal;
that it builds in cliffs of rocks near the deer
forests, and makes great havoc not only
amongst them, but also the white hares and
ptarmigans.</p>

<p class='c006'>Willoughby gives a curious account of the
nest of this species found in the woodlands,
near the river Derwent, in the Peak of Derbyshire.
He says it was made of large sticks,
lined with two layers of rushes, between
which was one of heath; that in it was one
young and an addle egg, and by them a lamb,
a hare, and three heath-poults.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instances have been recorded of infants
being carried to their nests; and in the Orkneys
there is a law which entitles any person
killing one of these birds, to a hen out of
every house in the parish in which it is killed.
They are remarkable for their longevity, and
abstinence from food. Pennant mentions one
enduring hunger for twenty-one days.</p>

<p class='c006'>As we were sporting in the neighbourhood
of Ben-Lomond, on the summit of the lesser
mountains that form its base, a grouse, (Tetrao
Scoticus), was wounded, and flew with
difficulty eighty or a hundred paces. An
eagle, apparently of this species, perceiving the
laborious flight of the grouse, descended with
rapid wing from the adjacent lofty cliffs, before
our guns were re-loaded, and, in defiance of
the shouts made to deter him, carried off his
prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>In another part of the Western Highlands
of Scotland, we had an opportunity of witnessing
the power of the flight of this bird in
pursuit of its quarry. An old black-cock
(Tetrao tetrix) was sprung, and was instantly
pursued by the eagle, (who must have been
on a neighbouring rock unperceived,) across
the glen, the breadth of which was at least two
miles. The eagle made several unsuccessful
pounces, but as there was no cover and the
bird large, it probably fell a victim in the end.—<i>Smith</i>—<i>Pennant</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_223.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this species varies from
twenty-six ounces to two pounds. The length
is nineteen inches, and the breadth thirty-one.
The bill is bluish-black, short, thick, and
elevated at the base; the head large, slightly
crested, and black, or rather of a glossy bottle-green,
with violet reflections; a large white
spot is placed on the space on each side between
the corners of the mouth and the eyes,
the irides of which are of a golden-yellow;
the throat, and a small portion of the upper
part of the neck, are of a sooty or velvet-black;
the lower, to the shoulders, the breast,
belly, and vent, white; but some of the side-feathers,
and those which cover the thighs,
are tipped with black; the scapulars white
and deep black; of the latter colour are also
the adjoining long tertial feathers, and those
on the greater part of the back; the first
fourteen primary quills, with all the outside
edge of the wing, including the ridge and a
portion of the coverts, are brownish black;
the middle part of the wing is white, crossed
by a narrow black stripe, which is formed by
the tips of the lesser coverts; tail dark, hoary
brown; legs short, of a reddish yellow colour,
with the webs dusky; the inner and hinder
toes are furnished with lateral webs; on the
latter these webs are large and flapped. Willoughby
says, “the windpipe hath a labyrinth
at the divarication, and besides, above swells
out into a belly or puff-like cavity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds do not congregate in large
flocks, nor are they numerous on the British
shores, or on the lakes in the interior. They
are late in taking their departure northward
in the spring, the specimens before mentioned
being shot in April. In their flight they make
they air whistle with the vigorous quick
strokes of their wings; they are excellent
divers, and seldom set foot on the shore, upon
which, it is said, they walk with great apparent
difficulty, and, except in the breeding
season, only repair to it for the purpose of
taking their repose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attempts which were made by M.
Baillon to domesticate these birds, he informs
the Count de Buffon, quite failed of success.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>An extraordinary occurrence took place,
March, 1810, near Drumburgh, a fisherman,
placed a flounder-net in the river Eden, which
is subject to the flux and reflux of the tide,
and on his returning to take up his net, instead
of finding fish, he found it loaded with
wild ducks; during his absence, a fleet of these
birds had alighted below the net, and on the
flowing of the tide, were carried, from the
contraction of the channel, with great impetuosity
into the net, and were drowned. He
caught one hundred and seventy golden-eyed
wild ducks, supposed to be from the Orkneys,
as very rarely any of that species frequent
that part of the country.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Golden Oriole</span> (<i>Oriolus galbula</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>), <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This is the only species ever found in England,
a few instances of which only are on record.
It is about the size of a blackbird:
length nine inches and a half. The bill is
brownish red; irides red. General colour of
the plumage fine golden yellow; between the
bill and eye a streak of black; the wings
black, marked here and there with yellow,
and a patch of the same in the middle of the
wing; the two middle feathers of the tail are
black, inclining to olive at the base, the very
tips yellow; the base half of the others black,
the rest yellow; legs lead-colour; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is of a dull greenish brown in
those parts where the male is black. Wings
dusky; tail dirty green; all but the two middle
feathers yellowish white at the ends.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful bird is not uncommon in
France, where it breeds. The nest is curiously
constructed, in shape like a purse: it is
fastened to the extreme forked branches of
tall trees, composed of fibres of hemp, or
straw mixed with fine dry stalks of grass,
and lined with moss and liverwort. She is
said to be so tenacious of her eggs as to suffer
herself to be taken on the nest.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Goldfinch</span>, (<i>Carduelis communis</i>, <span class='sc'>Cuvier</span>,) <i>s.</i> A singing bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful bird is rather less than the
chaffinch. The bill is white, with a black
point; irides dusky; the forehead and chin
rich scarlet; top of the head black; cheeks
white, bounded with black; hind part of the
head white; breast pale tawny brown; the
coverts of the wings black; quill feathers
dusky black, barred across with bright yellow;
tips white; belly white; the tail feathers
black; most of them marked with a white
spot near their ends; legs whitish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female differs very little in plumage
from the male: in general, the smaller coverts
of the wings are not so black. Young birds
are brown about the head for some time after
they leave the nest, and are by some called
grey-pates.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goldfinch is subject to variety in confinement;
sometimes wholly black; others
black and white, or quite white. A variety
is sometimes taken by the birdcatchers with
white spots under the throat: such is termed
a cheverel. It makes a very elegant nest,
formed externally of bents, moss, and liverwort,
woven together with wool; lined sometimes
with wool or hair, covered with thistle
down, or willow cotton.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds will in general take the materials
for building, which they can most easily
procure. On the tenth of May I observed a
pair of goldfinches beginning to make their
nest in my garden; they had formed the
ground-work with moss, grass, &amp;c., as usual,
but on my scattering small parcels of wool in
different parts of the garden, they, in a great
measure, left off the use of their own stuff,
and employed the wool. Afterwards, I gave
them cotton, on which they rejected the wool
and proceeded with the cotton; the third day
I supplied them with fine down, on which
they forsook both the other and finished their
work with this last article. The nest, when
completed, was somewhat larger than is usually
made by this bird, but retained the pretty
roundness of figure and neatness of workmanship,
which is proper to the goldfinch. The
nest was completed in the space of three days,
and remained unoccupied for the space of four
days; the first egg not being laid till the
seventh day from beginning the work. The
eggs are four or five in number, of a bluish
white, with a few spots, chiefly at the larger end.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goldfinch is easily tamed and easily
taught, and its capability of learning the notes
of other birds is well known; but the tricks
it may be taught to perform are truly astonishing.
A few years ago the Sieur Roman exhibited
his birds, which were goldfinches, linnets,
and canaries. One appeared dead, and
was held up by the tail or claw without exhibiting
any signs of life; a second stood on
its head with its claws in the air; a third imitated
a Dutch milkmaid going to market, with
pails on its shoulders; a fourth mimicked a
Venetian girl looking out at a window; a fifth
appeared as a soldier, and mounted guard as
a sentinel; and the sixth acted as a cannoneer
with a cap on its head, a firelock on its shoulder,
and a match in its claw, and discharged a
small cannon. The same bird also acted as
if it had been wounded. It was wheeled in a
barrow, to convey it, as it were, to the hospital;
after which, it flew away before the
company: the seventh turned a kind of windmill:
and the last bird stood in the midst of
some fireworks which were discharged all
round it, and this without exhibiting the least
symptom of fear.</p>

<p class='c006'>They may also be taught to draw up little
buckets or cups with food and water. To
teach them this, there must be put round
them a narrow soft leather belt, in which
there must be four holes—two for the wings,
and two for the feet. The belt is joined a
little below the breast, where there is a ring,
to which the chain is attached, that supports
the little bucket or cup. We have seen both
the goldfinch and lesser redpole perform this
action, but in a different manner. Their cage
had no wires,—only a back-board, a bottom-board,
and one perch. To one foot of the
bird was attached a light slender chain, which
allowed it more exercise than it could have
had in the common wire cage; at the outer
edge of the bottom-board was a ring, through
which ran the chain, to each end of which
were fastened the little buckets that held the
food and water, which the bird drew up with
its foot and bill; and as one bucket was drawn
up, the other sunk, thus lessening the difficulty,
and lightening the task.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Bolton</i>—<i>Syme.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Goosander</span> (<i>Mergus merganser</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>), <i>s.</i> a species of diver.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_225.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is the largest species of merganser;
weight about four pounds; length two feet
four inches. The bill three inches long, narrow,
serrated, or toothed, on the edges of both
mandibles; the tip of the upper hooked; colour
red: irides the same; the head and upper
part of the neck glossy greenish black; the
feathers on the crown and back of the head
are long and loose; the rest of the neck,
breast, and under parts, white; the sides,
above the thighs, undulated with dusky lines;
the upper part of the back black; lower part
of the back, rump, and tail coverts, brownish
ash-colour; the lesser wing coverts white;
the rest ash-colour, with some white; the
greater quill feathers are black, with ash-colour
on the interior webs of some of the inner
ones; the secondaries white, margined with
greenish black on the outer webs; the scapulars
nearest the body black, the others white;
the tail consists of eighteen ash-coloured feathers,
with dusky shafts; legs orange; in some
specimens the breast is of a rosy buff-colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goosander sometimes visits our rivers
and lakes in severe winters, but retires to the
more northern latitudes of Greenland and
Iceland, where it breeds. In the Orkneys
and Hebrides it is found the whole year round,
while in the other districts it is only a winter
visitant. It is not uncommon on the continent
of Europe and Asia, but most plentiful
towards the north. It is a winter inhabitant
of the sea shore, and fresh water lakes of
America, where they usually associate in small
parties of six and eight. They disappear from
that country in the month of April, and return
in November. Its food consists entirely
of fish, for which it dives with great celerity,
and holds its slippery prey with great security,
by means of its toothed bill, which is admirably
adapted to the purpose.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Canada Goose</i>, (<i>Anas Canadensis</i>
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>L’Oie à cravate</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This
is less than the swan goose, but taller and
longer than the common goose, and may
be considered as the connecting link between
that species and the swan. Their average
weight is about nine pounds, and the length
about three feet six inches. The bill is black
and two inches and a half long: irides hazel:
the head and neck are also black, with a crescent
shaped white band on the throat, which
tapers off to a point on each side below the
cheeks, to the hinder part of the head: the
whiteness of this cravat is heightened by its contrast
with the dark surrounding plumage, and
it looks very pretty: this mark also distinguishes
it from others of the goose tribe. All the
upper parts of the plumage, the breast, and a
portion of the belly, are of a dull brown, sometimes
mixed with grey: the lower part of the
neck, the belly, vent, and upper tail coverts,
white; quills and tail black; legs dingy blue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The English of Hudson’s Bay depend greatly
on geese, of these and other kinds, for their
support; and, in favourable years, kill three or
four thousand, which they salt and barrel.
Their arrival is impatiently attended; it is the
harbinger of the spring, and the month named
by the Indians the goose-moon. They appear
usually at our settlements in numbers, about
St. George’s day, O. S. and fly northward to
nestle in security. They prefer islands to the
continent, as further from the haunts of men.
Thus Marble Island was found, in August, to
swarm with swans, geese, and ducks; the old
ones moulting, and the young at that time incapable
of flying.</p>

<p class='c006'>The English send out their servants, as well
as Indians, to shoot these birds on their passage.
It is in vain to pursue them; they therefore
form a row of huts made of boughs, at
musket shot distance from each other, and
place them in a line across the vast marshes
of the country. Each hovel, or, as it is
called, stand, is occupied by only a single person.
These attend the flight of the birds, and,
on their approach, mimic their cackle so well
that the geese will answer, and wheel and come
nearer the stand. The sportsman keeps motionless,
and on his knees, with his gun cocked,
the whole time; and never fires till he has
seen the eyes of the geese. He fires as they
are going from him, then picks up another gun
that lies by him, and discharges that. The
geese which he has killed he sets upon sticks
as if alive, to decoy others; he also makes artificial
birds for the same purpose. In a good
day (for they fly in very uncertain and unequal
numbers) a single Indian will kill two
hundred. Notwithstanding every species of
goose has a different call, yet the Indians are
admirable in their imitation of every one.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vernal flight of the geese lasts from the
middle of April until the middle of May.
Their first appearance coincides with the thawing
of the swamps, when they are very lean.
The autumnal, or the season of their return
with their young, is from the middle of August
to the middle of October. Those which
are taken in this latter season, when the frosts
usually begin, are preserved in their feathers
and left to be frozen for the fresh provisions of
the winter stock. The feathers constitute an
article of commerce, and are sent into England.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Common Wild Goose</i>—<i>Grey Lag Goose</i>,
(<i>Anas anser</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>L’Oie Sauvage</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)
This wild goose generally weighs about ten
pounds, and measures two feet nine inches in
length, and five in breadth. The bill is thick
at the base, tapers towards the tip, and is of a
yellowish red colour, with the nail white: the
head and neck are of a cinereous brown, tinged
with dull yellow, and from the separations of
the feathers, the latter appears striped downwards:
the upper part of the plumage is of a
deep brown, mixed with ash-grey; each feather
is lighter on the edges, and the lesser coverts
are tipped with white: the shafts of the primary
quills are white, the webs grey, and the
tips black: the secondaries black, edged with
white: the breast and belly are crossed and
clouded with dusky and ash on a whitish
ground; and the tail coverts and vent are of
a snowy whiteness: the middle feathers of the
tail are dusky, tipped with white: those adjoining
more deeply tipped, and the exterior
ones nearly all white: legs pale red.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is common in this country, and
although large flocks of them, well known to
the curious, in all the various shapes which
they assume in their flight, are seen regularly
migrating southward in the autumn, and northward
in the spring, yet several of them are
known to remain and breed in the fens of Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire, and, it is said,
in various other parts of Great Britain. Pennant
says they reside in the fens the whole year,
breed there, and hatch about eight or nine
young ones, which are often taken, easily made
tame, and much more esteemed for the excellent
flavour of their flesh than the domestic
goose.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Egyptian Goose.</i>—(<i>Anas Ægyptiaca</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>L’Oie d’ Egypte</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This beautifully
variegated species is nearly the size of
the grey lag, or the common wild goose. The
bill red, about two inches in length, tip black,
and nostrils dusky; eyelids red, and the irides
pale yellow; the throat, cheeks, and upper
part of the head, are white; a rusty chestnut-coloured
patch, on each side of the head, surrounds
the eyes. About two-thirds of the
neck, from the head downwards, is of a pale
reddish bay colour, darker at the lower end;
a broad deep chestnut-coloured spot covers the
middle of the breast; the shoulders and scapulars
are of a reddish brown, prettily crossed
with numerous dark waved lines; the wing
coverts are white; the greater ones barred
near the tips with black; the secondary quills
are tinged with reddish bay, and bordered
with chestnut; those of the primaries, which
join them, are edged with glossy green, and
the rest of the first quills are black; the lower
part of the back, the rump, and tail, are black;
the belly is white, but all the other fore-parts
and sides of the body, from the neck near the
vent, are delicately pencilled with narrow rust-coloured
zigzag lines on a pale ash-grey ground;
each wing is furnished on the bend with a
short blunt spur. The colours of the female
are pretty much the same as those of the
male, but not by any means so bright or distinctly
marked. This kind is common in a
wild state in Egypt, at the Cape of Good
Hope, and in various parts of the intermediate
territories of Africa, whence they have been
brought into, and domesticated in this and
other civilised countries, and are now an admired
ornament on many pieces of water contiguous
to gentlemen’s seats.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red-breasted Goose.</i>—(<i>Siberian Goose</i>;
<i>Anser ruficollis</i>.)—The red-breasted goose
measures above twenty inches in length, and
its extended wings three feet ten in breadth.
The bill is short, of a brown colour, with the
nail black; irides yellowish hazel; the cheeks
and brow are dusky, speckled with white; an
oval white spot occupies the space between
the bill and the eyes, and is bounded above,
on each side of the head, by a black line
which falls down the hinder part of the neck;
the chin, throat, crown of the head, and hinder
part of the neck to the back, are black;
two stripes of white fall down from behind
each eye on the sides of the neck, and meet
in the middle; the other parts of the neck,
and the upper part of the breast, are of a
deep rusty red, and the latter is terminated
by two narrow bands of white and black; the
back and wings are dusky; the greater coverts
edged with grey; sides and lower part of the
breast black; belly, upper and under tail coverts,
white; legs dusky.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful species is a native of Russia
and Siberia, whence they migrate southward
in the autumn, and return in the spring; they
are said to frequent the Caspian Sea, and are
supposed to winter in Persia. They are very
rare in this country.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>White-fronted Wild Goose.</i>—(<i>Laughing
Goose</i>; <i>Anas albifrons</i>; <i>L’ Oie rieuse</i>,
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This species measures two
feet four inches in length, and four feet six in
the extended wings, and weighs about five
pounds. The bill is thick at the base, of a
yellowish red colour; the nail white; from
the base of the bill and corners of the mouth
a white patch is extended over the forehead;
the rest of the head, neck, and upper parts of
the plumage, are dark brown; the primary
and secondary quills are of the same colour,
but much darker, and the wing coverts are
tinged with ash; the breast and belly are
dirty white, spotted with dusky; the tail is
of a hoary ash-coloured brown, and surrounded,
like the lag goose’s, with a white ring at the
base; the legs yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds form a part of those vast tribes
which swarm about Hudson’s Bay, and the
north of Europe and Asia, during the summer
months, and are but thinly scattered over the
other quarters of the world. They visit the
fens and marshy places in England in small
flocks in the winter months, and disappear
about the beginning of March. It is said
that they never feed in the corn fields, but
confine themselves wholly to such wilds and
swamps as are constantly covered with water.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Wild geese are very destructive to the
growing corn in the fields where they happen
to halt in their migratory excursion. In
some countries they are caught at those seasons
in long nets, resembling those used for
catching larks: to these nets the wild geese
are decoyed by tame ones, placed there for
that purpose. Many other schemes are contrived
to take these wary birds; but, as they
feed only in the day time, and betake themselves
to the water at night, the fowler must
exert his utmost care and ingenuity in order
to accomplish his ends: all must be planned
in the dark, and every trace of suspicion removed,
for nothing can exceed the vigilant
circumspection and acute ear of the sentinel,
who, placed on some eminence, with outstretched-neck,
surveys every thing that
moves within the circle of the centre on
which he takes his stand; and the instant he
sounds the alarm, the whole flock betake
themselves to flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The time that wild geese feed in this country
is by night, and particularly during moonlight.
I have never known them either
netted or decoyed; and all the shooter has to
rely upon is patience and a long barrel.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>M. Cuvier has published a brief description
of a bird produced between a swan and a
goose, which in fact amounts to its being a
perfect goose, in every thing but size like its
mother, which it greatly exceeds.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c006'>A fox, when pressed by hounds, will seldom

in the season, to destroy the rabbits.—<i>Beckford.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Goshawk</span>, <i>s.</i> A hawk of a large kind.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_229.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is a large species, superior in size to
the buzzard; length twenty-two inches or
more; the bill is blue, tip black; cere yellowish
green; irides yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The head, hind part of the neck, back, and
wings, deep brown; over the eye is a white
line, and a broken patch of the same colour
on the side of the neck; the breast and belly
marked with numerous transverse bars of
black and white; the tail is long, and ash-coloured,
with four or five dusky bars; legs
yellow; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goshawk is rarely found in England,
but is not uncommon in the wild and mountainous
parts of Scotland, where it is known
to breed in the forest of Rothemurchus, and
on the woody banks of the Dee. They are
said to be numerous in the Orkney Islands,
where they breed in the rocks and sea cliffs.
They more generally build however in lofty
fir trees, and lay from two to four eggs, of a
bluish white, marked with streaks and spots
of reddish brown. Its flight is described to
be very rapid, generally low, and it strikes its
prey on the wing, near the ground, being incapable
of mounting. If its prey take refuge,
it will wait patiently on a tree, or a stone,
until the game, pressed by hunger, is induced
to move; and as this hawk is capable of great
abstinence, it generally succeeds in taking it.
Colonel Thornton informs us, that he flew one
at a pheasant, which got into cover, and the
hawk was lost; at ten o’clock next morning
the falconer found her, and just as he caught
her the pheasant ran and rose. According to
Meyer, it will prey on its own young, but its
principal food is wild ducks, hares, and rabbits.
In the young, the head, neck, and belly, are
of a rufous colour, with long brown spots, and
tips of the tail white. In this plumage they
have been termed gentil falcons. In the days
of falconry, they were held in high repute for
hunting cranes, geese, and the larger sorts of
game, and were considered by falconers, the
best and most courageous of the short-winged
hawks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goshawk is common in France, Germany,
and Russia; it is also found in America,
but is rare in Holland.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The goshawk is taken by a net about eight
feet deep, and of sufficient length to inclose
a square of nine or ten feet. It is suspended
to upright stakes, by notches cut upwards, so
that it may be disengaged from them, when
the hawk strikes against it. This inclosure
is left open at the top, and in the middle a
pigeon is to be tied to the ground for a bait.
The meshes of this net should not be too
small, and the colour should be as much as
possible like that of the surrounding objects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goshawk is termed a hawk of the fist,
because it is from thence, and not from the
air, that he flies at his game. He is never to
be hooded unless for a short time when first
taken, or to keep him quiet in travelling.
The resting-place of short-winged hawks is
called a perch. It is a pole of about an inch
and a half in diameter, fixed horizontally about
four feet from the ground. It is to be placed
under a tree in fine weather, and in some
sheltered place when it rains. To the perch
is suspended a piece of cloth, or of matting,
hanging like a curtain, which assists the hawk
in regaining the perch when he has <i>baited</i> off,
and prevents him from twisting the leash
round it by passing under. The swivel that
is fixed to the leash is to be tied close to the
top of the perch, and is attached to the jesses
by a short leash, six or eight inches long, in
such a manner as to be easily taken off when
the hawk is to be prepared for flying. He is
then to be held on the fist by the jesses, in
the same way as the slight falcon.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the goshawk is carried without a hood,
and as he is not to be brought down by the
lure, but must come to the fist at the falconer’s
call, it is essential that he should be made as
tame as possible, and this can only be done by
almost constant <i>carriage</i>, and by allowing
him frequently to <i>pull upon</i> a stump or
pinion, from which he can get but little meat.
He will soon learn to come from the perch
to the fist, if held close to him when allured
by meat. By persevering in this practice,
and by cautiously increasing the distance, he
will at length be brought to come to the fist,
when he is thirty or forty yards off. It is
hardly necessary to say, that a creance must
always be attached to the leash when these
lessons are given, until the hawk is sufficiently
reclaimed to be trusted at large, and
with this precaution too much must not be
required of him at a time. In breaking
hawks, and all other animals, much additional
trouble is occasioned, and much time is lost
in endeavouring to get them on too fast.
When the goshawk will come freely to the
fist, not only from the perch, but from the
ground, and from low trees (on which he
should frequently be placed), it will only be
necessary to give him a few live partridges in
the way that I have described, and he will be
ready for the field.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Granivorous birds.</i>—Birds may be distinguished,
like quadrupeds, into two kinds or
classes—granivorous and carnivorous; like
quadrupeds, too, there are some that hold a
middle nature, and partake of both. Granivorous
birds are furnished with larger intestines,
and proportionally longer, than those of
the carnivorous kind. Their food, which consists
of grain of various sorts, is conveyed
whole and entire into the first stomach or
craw, where it undergoes a partial dilution by
a liquor, secreted from the glands, and spread
over its surface; it is then received into
another species of stomach, where it is further
diluted; after which it is transmitted
into the gizzard, or true stomach, consisting of
two very strong muscles, covered externally
with a tendinous substance, and lined with a
thick membrane of prodigious power and
strength; in this place the food is completely
triturated, and rendered fit for the operation
of the gastric juices. The extraordinary
powers of the gizzard in comminuting the
food, so as to prepare it for digestion, would
exceed all credibility, were they not supported
by incontrovertible facts, founded upon experiments.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to ascertain the strength of these
stomachs, the ingenious Spallanzani made the
following curious and very interesting experiments:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Tin tubes, full of grain, were forced into
the stomachs of turkeys, and after remaining
twenty hours, were found to be broken, compressed,
and distorted in the most irregular
manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>In proceeding further, the same author relates,
that the stomach of a cock, in the space
of twenty-four hours, broke off the angles of a
piece of rough jagged glass, and upon examining
the gizzard, no wound or laceration appeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Twelve strong needles were firmly fixed in
a ball of lead, the points of which projected
about a quarter of an inch from the surface;
thus armed, it was covered with a case of paper,
and forced down the throat of a turkey;
the bird retained it a day and a half, without
showing the least symptom of uneasiness; the
points of all the needles were broken off close
to the surface of the ball, except two or three,
of which the stumps projected a little. The
same author relates another experiment, seemingly
still more cruel; he fixed twelve small
lancets, very sharp, in a similar ball of lead,
which was given in the same manner to a turkey
cock, and left eight hours in the stomach;
at the expiration of which the organ was opened
but nothing appeared except the naked ball,
the twelve lancets having been broken to pieces,
the stomach remaining perfectly sound and entire.
From these curious and well-attested
facts we may conclude, that the stones so often
found in the stomachs of many of the feathered
tribes, are highly useful in comminuting grain
and other hard substances which constitute
their food.</p>

<p class='c006'>Granivorous birds partake much of the nature
and disposition of herbivorous quadrupeds.
In both the number of their stomachs, the
length and capacity of their intestines, and the
quality of their food, they are very similar; they
are likewise both distinguished by the gentleness
of their tempers and manners. Contented
with the seeds of plants, with fruits, insects,
and worms, their chief attention is directed to
procuring food, hatching and rearing their offspring,
and avoiding the snares of men, and the
attacks of birds of prey, and other rapacious
animals. They are a mild and gentle race,
and are in general so tractable as easily to be
domesticated.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

by Mr. Joseph Manton’s gravitating
stops, which act of themselves, to remedy the
serious danger of loading with a barrel cocked;
and, with these stops, you may, by holding the
gun downwards, carry both barrels cocked,
through a hedge-row, with little or no danger,
if any circumstance could justify such determined
preparation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gravitating stops, I should not omit to
mention, require to be kept very clean, as,
with rust or dirt under them, they will not
fall so readily, and thereby prevent the gun
from going off. This I name as a caution to

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gray</span>, <i>s.</i> White, with a mixture of black; white or hoary with old age;
dark, like the opening or close of day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Grey horses are of different shades, from
the lightest silver to a dark iron grey. The
silver grey reminds the observer of the palfrey,
improved by an admixture of Arab
blood. He does not often exceed fourteen
hands and a half high, and is round carcassed—light
legged—with oblique pasterns, calculated
for a light carriage, or for a lady’s riding—seldom
subject to disease—but not very
fleet, or capable of hard work.</p>

<p class='c006'>The iron grey is usually a larger horse;
higher in the withers, deeper and thinner in
the carcass, more angular in all his proportions,
and in many cases a little too long in
the legs. Some of these greys make good
hackneys and hunters, and especially the Irish
horses; but they are principally used for the
carriage. They have more endurance than
the flatness of the chest would promise; but
their principal defect is their feet, which are
liable to contraction, and yet that contraction
is not so often accompanied by lameness as in
many other horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dappled grey is generally a handsomer
and a better horse: all the angular points of
the iron grey are filled up, and with that which
not only adds to symmetry, but to use. Whether
as a hackney, or, the larger variety, a
carriage-horse, there are few better, especially
since his form has been so materially improved,
and so much of his heaviness got rid
of by the free use of foreign blood. There
are not, however, so many dappled greys as
there used to be, since the bays have been
bred with so much care. The dappled grey,
if dark at first, generally retains his colour to
old age.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some of the greys approach to a nutmeg,
or even bay colour. Many of these are handsome,
and most of them are hardy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Grayling</span>, <i>s.</i> The umber, a fish.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_232.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Grayling are never found in streams that
run from glaciers—at least near their source;
and they are killed by cold or heat. I once
put some grayling from the Teme, in September,
with some trout, into a confined water,
rising from a spring in the yard at Dawnton;
the grayling all died, but the trout lived. And
in the hot summer of 1825, great numbers of
large grayling died in the Avon, below Ringwood,
without doubt killed by the heat in
July.</p>

<p class='c006'>The grayling lies deeper and is not so shy a
fish as the trout; and, provided your link is
fine, is not apt to be scared by the cast of flies
on the water. The fineness of the link, and
of the gut to which your flies are attached, is
a most essential point, and the clearer the
stream the finer should be the tackle. I have
known good fishermen foiled by using a gut of
ordinary thickness, though their flies were of
the right size and colour. Very slender transparent
gut of the colour of the water, is one of
the most important causes of success in grayling
fishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>He is to be fished for at all times, for he is
rarely so much out of season as to be a bad
fish; and when there are flies on the water, he
will generally take them: but as the trout
may be considered as a spring and summer fish,
so the grayling may be considered as a winter
and autumnal fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>Grayling do not refuse large flies; and in
the Avon and Test May flies, and even moths,
are greedily taken in the summer by large
grayling. Flies, likewise, that do not inhabit
the water, but are blown from the land, are
good baits for grayling. There is no method
more killing for large grayling, than applying
a grasshopper to the point of a leaded hook,
the lead and shank of which are covered with
green and yellow silk, to imitate the body of
the animal. This mode of fishing is called
sinking and drawing. I have seen it practised
in this river with as much success as maggot
fishing, and the fish taken were all of the
largest size; the method being most successful
in deep holes, where the bottom was not
visible, which are the natural haunts of such
fish. In the winter, grayling rise for an hour
or two in bright and tolerably warm weather,
and at this time the smallest imitations of black
or pale gnats that can be made, on the smallest
sized hook, succeed best in taking them.
In March, the dark-bodied willow fly may be
regarded as the earliest fly; the imitation of
which is made by a dark claret dubbing and
a dun hackle, or four small starlings’ wing
feathers. The blue dun comes on in the
middle of the day in this month, and is imitated
by dun hackles for wings and legs, and
an olive dubbing for body. In mild weather,
in morning and evening in this month, and
through April, the green tail, or grannon,
comes on in great quantities, and is well imitated
by a hen pheasant’s wing feather, a grey
or red hackle for legs, and a dark peacock’s
harle, or dark hare’s ear fur, for the body.
The same kind of fly, of a larger size, with
paler wings, kills well in the evening, through
May or June. The imitation of a water insect
called the spider-fly, with a lead-coloured
body and woodcock’s wings, is said to be a
killing bait on this and other rivers, in the
end of April and beginning of May, but I
never happened to see it on the water. The
darker alder fly, in May and June, is taken
greedily by the fish; it is imitated by a dark
shaded pheasant’s wing, black hackle for legs,
and a peacock’s harle, ribbed with red silk,
for the body. At this season, and in July,
imitations of the black and red palmer worms,
which I believe are taken for black or brown,
or red beetles or cockchafers, kill well; and
in dark weather there are usually very light
duns on the water. In August, imitations of
the house fly and blue bottle, and the red and
black ant fly, are taken, and are particularly
killing after floods in autumn, when great
quantities of the fly are destroyed and washed
down the river. In this month, in cloudy
days, pale blue duns often appear, and they
are still more common in September. Throughout
the summer and autumn, in fine calm
evenings, a large dun fly, with a pale yellow
body, is greedily taken by grayling after sunset,
and the imitation of it is very killing.
In the end of October, and through November,
there is no fly fishing but in the middle
of the day, when imitations of the smaller
duns may be used with great success; and I
have often seen the fish sport most, and fly
fishing pursued with great success in bright
sunshine, from twelve till half past two o’clock,
after severe frosts in the morning; and
I once caught under these circumstances a
very fine dish of fish on the 7th of November.
It was in the year 1816; the summer and
autumn had been peculiarly cold and wet, and,
probably in consequence of this, the flies were
in smaller quantity at their usual season, and
there were a greater proportion later in the
year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Grayling, if you take your station by the
side of a river, will rise nearer to you than
trout, for they lie deeper, and therefore are
not so much scared by an object on the bank;
but they are more delicate in the choice of
their flies than trout, and will much oftener
rise and refuse the fly. Trout, from lying
nearer the surface, are generally taken before
grayling where the water is slightly coloured,
or after a flood; and in rain trout usually rise
better than grayling, though it sometimes happens,
when great quantities of flies come out
in rain, grayling, as well as trout, are taken
with more certainty than at any other time.
The artificial fly, in such cases, looks like a
wet fly, and allures even the grayling, which
generally is more difficult to deceive than trout
in the same river.—<i>Sir Humphry Davy.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Grease</span>, <i>s.</i> The soft part of the fat; a swelling and gourdiness of the legs,
which generally happens to a horse after his journey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Swelled legs, although distinct from <i>grease</i>,
are apt to degenerate into it. This disease,
therefore, comes next under our consideration.
It is an inflammation of the skin of the heel,
sometimes of the fore, but oftener of the hind
foot. It is not a contagious disease, although
when it once appears in a stable it frequently
goes through it, for it is usually to be traced
to bad stable management. The skin of the
heel of the horse somewhat differs from that
of any other part. There is a great deal of
motion in the fetlock, and to prevent the skin
from excoriation or chapping, it is necessary
that it should be kept soft and pliable; therefore,
in the healthy state of the part, the skin
of the heel has a peculiar greasy feel. Under
inflammation, the secretion of this greasy matter
is stopped—the heels become red, dry,
and scurfy; and being almost constantly in
motion, cracks soon succeed: these sometimes
extend, and the whole surface of the heel
becomes a mass of soreness, ulceration, and
fungus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first appearance of grease is usually a
dry and scurfy state of the skin of the heel,
with redness, heat and itchiness. The heel
should be well washed with soap and water;
as much of the scurf should be detached as is
easily removable: white ointment composed
of one drachm of sugar of lead, rubbed down
with an ounce of lard, will usually supple and
cool, and heal the part.</p>

<p class='c006'>When cracks appear, the mode of treatment
will depend on their extent and depth.
If they are but slight, a lotion composed of a
solution of two drachms of blue vitriol, or
four of alum, in a pint of water, will often
speedily dry them up and close them. But
if the cracks are deep, with an ichorous discharge,
and the lameness considerable, it will
be necessary to poultice the heel. A poultice
of linseed meal will be the most effectual,
unless the discharge is thin and offensive,
when an ounce of finely powdered charcoal
should be mixed with the linseed meal, or a
poultice may be made with carrots boiled
soft, and mashed. The efficacy of a carrot
poultice is seldom sufficiently appreciated in
cases like these.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the inflammation and pain have
evidently subsided, and the cracks discharge
good matter, they may be dressed with an
ointment composed of one part of resin, and
three of lard, melted together, and one part
of calamine powder added, when these begin
to get cool. The healing will be quickened
if the cracks are occasionally washed with
either the vitriol or alum solution. A mild
diuretic may here be given every third day,
but a mild dose of physic will form the best
medicine that can be administered.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the chaps or cracks have healed,
the legs will sometimes continue gorged and
swelled. A flannel bandage evenly applied
over the whole of the swelled part will be
very serviceable; or, should the season admit
of it, a run at grass, particularly spring grass,
should be allowed. A blister is inadmissible,
from the danger of bringing back the inflammation
of the skin, and discharge from it;
but the actual cautery, taking especial care
not to penetrate the skin, must occasionally
be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c006'>There will be great danger in suddenly stopping
this discharge. Inflammation of a more
important part has rapidly succeeded to the injudicious
attempt. The local application should
be directed to the abatement of the inflammation.
The poultices just referred to should
be diligently used night and day, and especially
the carrot poultice; and, when the heat
and tenderness and stiffness of motion have
diminished, astringent lotions may be applied;
either the alum lotion, or a strong decoction
of oak bark, changed, or used alternately, but
not mixed. The cracks should likewise be
dressed with the ointment above mentioned;
and the moment the horse can bear it, a flannel
bandage should be put on, reaching from
the coronet, to three or four inches above the
swelling.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walking exercise should be resorted to as
soon as the horse is able to bear it, and this
by degrees may be increased to a gentle trot.—<i>The
Horse.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The bills of this genus are compressed on
the sides, and though not large, are firm and
strong, straight and sharp pointed: nostrils
linear; a bare space between the bill and the
eyes; tongue slightly cloven at the end; body
depressed; feathers thickly set, compact, very
smooth, and glossy; wings short, scapulars
long; no tail; legs placed far behind, much
compressed, or flattened on the sides, and serrated
behind with a double row of notches;
toes furnished on each side with membranes;
the inner toes broader than the outer; the
nails broad and flat.</p>

<p class='c006'>This genus is ranked by Ray and Linnæus
with the diver and guillemot; but as the
grebes differ materially from those birds,
Brisson, Pennant, and Latham, have separated
them. The grebes are almost continually
upon the water, where they are remarkable
for their agility: at sea they seem to sport
with the waves, through which they seem to
dart with the greatest ease, and, in swimming,
slide along, as it were without any apparent
effort upon the surface, with wonderful velocity;
they also dive to a great depth in pursuit
of their prey. They frequent fresh-water
lakes and inlets of rivers as well as the ocean,
to which they are obliged to resort in severe
seasons, when the former are bound up by the
ice. No cold or damp can penetrate their
thick, close plumage, which looks as it were
glazed on the surface, and by which they are
enabled, while they have open water, to brave
the rigours of the coldest winter. They can
take wing from the water, or drop from an
eminence, and fly with great swiftness to a
considerable distance; but when they happen
to alight on the land, are helpless, for they
cannot either rise from the flat surface of the
ground, or make much progress in walking
upon it. On shore they sit with the body
erect, commonly upon the whole length of
their legs, and, in attempting to regain the
water, they awkwardly waddle forward in the
same position; and, if by any interruption
they happen to fall on their belly, they sprawl
with their feet, and flap their short wings as
if they were wounded, and may easily be taken
by the hand, for they can make no other defence
than by striking violently with their
sharp-pointed beak. They live upon fish, and
it is said, also upon fresh water and sea-weeds.
They are generally very fat and heavy in proportion
to their size.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females generally build their nests in
the holes of the rocky precipices which overhang
the sea-shores; and those which breed
on lakes, make theirs of withered reeds and
rushes, &amp;c., and fix it among the growing
stalks of a tuft, or bush, of such like herbage,
close by the water’s edge. They lay from
two to four eggs at one hatching.</p>

<p class='c006'>The skins of these birds are dressed with
the feathers on, and made into warm beautiful
tippets and muffs; the under part only is
used for this purpose, and a skin of one of the
species sells as high as fourteen shillings.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Great Crested Grebe.</i>—(<i>Greater crested
Douker</i>, <i>Car Goose</i>, <i>Ash-coloured Loon</i>,
or <i>Gaunt</i>, <i>Colymbus cristatus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Grêbe huppé</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird is the
largest of the grebes, weighing about two
pounds and a half, and measuring twenty-one
inches in length, and thirty in breadth. The
bill is about two inches and a quarter long,
dark at the tip, and red at the base; the bare
stripe, or core, between the bill and eyes, is
in the breeding season red, afterwards change
to dusky; irides fine pale crimson. The head,
in adult males, is furnished with a great
quantity of feathers, which form a kind of
ruff, surrounding the upper part of the neck;
those on each side of the head, behind, are
longer than the rest, and stand out like ears:
this ruff is of a bright ferruginous colour,
edged on the under side with black. The
upper parts of the plumage are of a sooty or
mouse-coloured brown; the under parts of a
glossy or silvery white; the inner ridge of the
wing is white; the secondaries of the same
colour, forming an oblique bar across the
wing when closed: the outsides of the legs
are dusky, the inside and toes of a pale
green.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is common in the fens and
lakes in various parts of England, where they
breed and rear their young. The female conceals
her nest among the flags and reeds which
grow in the water, upon which it is said to
float, and that she hatches her eggs amidst
the moisture which oozes through it. It is
made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks,
and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant
says) the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily,
pond-weed, and water-violet; and he
asserts, that when it happens to be blown
from among the reeds, it floats about upon the
surface of the open water.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are met with in almost every
lake in the northern parts of Europe, as far as
Iceland, and southward to the Mediterranean;
they are also found in various parts of America.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tippet Grebe, Greater Dabchick, or
Greater Loon.</i>—(<i>Colymbus urinator</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>Le Grêbe</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird differs from the
last only in being somewhat less, in having
its neck, in most specimens, striped downward
on the sides with narrow lines of dusky
and white, and in having no crest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Modern ornithologists begin to suspect, that
the tippet grebe is the female of the great
crested grebe, or a young bird of that species,
Latham says, “It is with some reluctance,
that we pen our doubts concerning the identity
of this, as a species, at least as being distinct
from the great crested grebe, in contradiction
to what former authors have recorded
on the subject. It is certain that the last-named
bird varies exceedingly at different
periods of life; and we are likewise as certain,
that the birds which have been pointed out to
us as the Geneva grebes, have been no other
than young ones of the great crested, not
having yet attained the crest; and whoever
will compare Brisson’s three figures of the
birds in question, will find (the crest excepted)
that they all exactly coincide, allowing for
their different periods of ages.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Eared Grebe.</i>—This bird measures about
twelve inches in length, and twenty two from
tip to tip of the wings. The bill is black, inclining
to red towards the base, rather slender,
nearly an inch long, and slightly bent upwards
at the point, lore and irides red; the head is
thickly set and enlarged with feathers of a
sooty black colour, except two large loose and
spreading orange-coloured tufts, which take
their rise behind each eye, flow backwards,
and nearly meet at their tips, the neck and upper
parts of the plumage are black, the under
parts of a glossy white; the sides a rusty chestnut
colour; legs greenish black. The male
and female are nearly alike, only the latter is
not furnished or puffed up about the head with
such a quantity of feathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is not numerous in the British
isles. Pennant says they inhabit and breed
in the fens near Spalding in Lincolnshire, and
that the female makes a nest not unlike that
of the crested grebe, and lays four or five
small white eggs. The eared grebe is found
in the northern regions of Europe, as far as
Iceland, and also met with in southern climates.
The circumnavigator Bougainville
says, it is called the “Diver with spectacles,”
in the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dusky Grebe</i>, <i>Black and White Dabchick</i>,
(<i>Colymbus nigricans</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span> <i>La petite Grêbe</i>
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This species measures about an inch
less in length, and two in breadth, than the
last. The bill is more than an inch long, and
of a pale blue colour, with reddish edges; lore
and orbits red; irides bright yellow: the upper
part of the head, hinder part of the neck,
scapulars, and rump, are of a dark sooty or
a mouse-coloured brown; the feathers on
the back are nearly of the same colour, but
glossy, and with greyish edges; the ridge of
the wings and secondary quills are white, the
rest of the wing dusky. There is a pale spot
before each eye; the cheeks and throat are
white; the fore part of the neck is light
brown; and the breast and belly are white
and glossy like satin; the thighs and vent are
covered with dirty white downy feathers; the
legs are white behind, dusky on the outer
side, and pale blue on the inner sides and shins;
the toes and webbed membranes are also blue
on the upper sides, and dark underneath.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red-necked Grebe</i> (<i>Colymbus subscristatus</i>,
<i>Le Jougris</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird measures,
from the bill to the rump, seventeen inches;
to the end of the toes twenty-one; and weighs
eighteen ounces and three quarters. The bill
is about two inches long, dusky or horn-coloured
on the ridge and tip, and on the
sides of it, towards the corners of the mouth,
of a reddish yellow; the underside of the
lower mandible is also of the latter colour:
lore dusky; irides dark hazel; the cheeks
and throat are of a dirty or greyish white;
the upper part of the head is black, with a
greyish cast, and the feathers are lengthened
on each side, on a line with the eyes backward,
so as to look like a pair of rounded
ears—these it can raise or depress at pleasure:
the fore part and sides of the neck are of a
dingy brown, mixed with feathers of a bright
rusty red; the upper parts of the plumage are
of a darkish mouse-coloured brown, lightest
on the wing-coverts, deepest on the scapulars
and rump, and edged with grey on the shoulders;
the under parts are of a glossy white,
like satin, mottled with indistinct brownish
spots: primary quills brownish tawny, with
dark-coloured tips; secondaries white: outer
sides of the legs dusky, inner sides sallow
green; webs of the outer toes flesh colour,
middle ones redder, and the inner ones
orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pennant supposes the red-necked grebe to
be only a variety of the great crested grebe;
but Latham, who has been furnished with
several specimens, is of opinion that it is a
distinct species. He describes the adult males
in full feather, as having their necks of an
uniform reddish chestnut; and the younger
birds, when they have not obtained their full
plumage, to be only partially spotted on their
necks with that colour.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Little Grebe, Dab-chick, Small Doucher,
Dipper, or Didapper</i> (<i>Colymbus minutus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Castagneaux</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This is
the least of the grebe tribe, weighing only
between six and seven ounces, and measuring,
to the rump, ten inches, to the end of the toes
thirteen, and about sixteen from tip to tip of
the wings. The bill is scarcely an inch long,
of a dusky reddish colour; irides hazel; the
head is thickly clothed with a downy kind of
soft feathers, which it can puff up to a great
size, or lay down flat at pleasure; the cheeks
are mostly of a bay colour, fading towards the
chin and throat into a yellowish white. The
neck, breast, and all the upper parts of the
plumage, are of a brown or chestnut colour,
tinged with red, lightest on the rump: the
belly is white, clouded with ash-colour, mixed
with red: thighs and vent grey: greater
quills dark brown; the lesser white on their
inner webs: legs dirty olive green.</p>

<p class='c006'>The little grebe is a true aquatic, for it
seldom quits the water, nor ventures beyond
the sedgy margins of the lake where it has
taken up its abode. It is a most excellent
diver, and can remain a long while under
water, in pursuit of its prey, or to shun danger.
It is found in almost every lake, and
sometimes upon rivers, but seldom goes out
to sea. Its food is of the same kind, and its
habits much the same as those of the other
grebes.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species of the grebe is an inhabitant of
both Europe and America.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Black-chin grebe.</i>—This bird is described
as being larger than the last. Chin black;
forepart of the neck ferruginous; hinder part

length and dimensions, being only about six
ounces; although it measures from the tip of
its beak to the end of its tail fourteen inches,
and to the toes twenty, and from tip to tip of
the wings twenty-five. The bill is about two
inches and a half long, straight and slender:
the upper mandible black; the under reddish
at its base. The upper parts of its plumage
are pale brownish ash colour; but each feather
is marked down the shaft with glossy
bronze brown; the under parts, and rump,
are of a pure white: a whitish streak passes
over each eye; the quill-feathers are dusky,
plain on the outer webs; but the inner ones
are speckled with white spots: the tail is
white, crossed with dark waved bars: the legs
are long; bare about two inches above the

<p class='c006'><i>The Irish greyhound.</i>—(<i>Canis Graius
Hibernicus</i>, <span class='sc'>Ray</span>.)—This is one of the
largest of the canine race, with an air at once
beautiful, striking, and majestic. He has been
known to grow to the extraordinary height of
four feet, although the general standard is
about three feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>In shape, the Irish greyhound somewhat resembles
the common greyhound, only that he
is much larger, and more muscular in his formation;
clumsy in all his different parts, and
is quite unserviceable for hunting either the
stag, fox, or hare. His chief use, in former
times, was in clearing the country of wolves
and wild boars, for which his great size and
strength peculiarly adapted him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The colour of the Irish greyhound is a pale
cinnamon or fawn. His aspect is mild, and
his disposition gentle and peaceable. It is
said he is greatly an overmatch for either the
mastiff or bull dog; and when he fights, he
generally seizes his antagonist by the back, and
shakes him to death, which his great strength
enables him to do with ease.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Buffon supposes the great Danish dog to
be only a variety of the Irish greyhound: and
Mr. Pennant was of opinion that the French
matin and the Albian dog were also varieties of
the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Irish greyhound is now rarely to be
met with even in his native country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., one of the
vice-presidents of the Linnæan Society, took
the measurement of one of the Marquis of
Sligo’s dogs, which was as follows:—“From
the point of the nose to the tip of the tail, sixty-one
inches; tail, seventeen and a half inches
long; from the tip of the nose to the back part
of the skull, ten inches; from the back part of
the skull to the beginning of the tail, thirty-three
inches; from the toe to the top of the foreshoulder,
twenty-eight inches and a half; length
of the leg sixteen inches; from the top of the
hind toes to the hind shoulders, thirteen inches;
from the point of the nose to the eye, four
inches and a half; the ears, six inches long;
round the widest part of the belly, (about three
inches from the forelegs,) thirty-five inches;
twenty-six inches round the hinder part, close
to the hind legs; the hair short and smooth;
the colour of some brown and white, of others
black and white.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They seemed good-tempered animals, but,
from the accounts Mr. Lambert received, it is
obvious that they must have degenerated, particularly
in point of size.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Goldsmith says he has seen a dozen of
these dogs, and assures us the largest was about
four feet high, and as tall as a calf of a year
old.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Scottish Highland Greyhound or Wolf
Dog</i>, (<i>Canis Caledonius.</i>)—This is a large
and powerful dog, nearly equal in size to the
Irish greyhound. His general aspect is commanding
and fierce; his head is long, and muzzle
rather sharp; his ears pendulous, but not
long; his eyes large, keen, and penetrating,
half concealed among the long, stiff, bristly
hair with which his face is covered; his body
is very strong and muscular, deep-chested, tapering
towards the loins, and his back slightly
arched; his hind-quarters are furnished with
large prominent muscles; and his legs are long,
strongboned, and straight,—a combination of
qualities which gives him that speed and long
duration in the chase for which he is so eminently
distinguished. His hair is shaggy and
wiry, of a reddish colour, mixed with white:
his tail is rough, which he carries somewhat
in the manner of a stag-hound, but not quite
so erect.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the dog formerly used by the highland
chieftains of Scotland in their grand hunting
parties, and is in all probability the same
noble dog used in the time of Ossian.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotch Highland greyhound will either
hunt in packs or singly.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Russian Greyhound</i>, (<i>Canis Graius
Borealis.</i>)—This is a large and powerful dog,
nearly equal in strength to the Irish greyhound,
which he also resembles in shape; his hair is
long and bushy, and his tail forms a spiral curl,
but which in the chase stands nearly straight
behind him. The colour of the Russian greyhound
is generally of a dark umber brown,
but sometimes black: his coat is rough and
shaggy.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Russian greyhound loses sight of
the hare, he runs by the scent. Indeed, when
parties go out a coursing, this dog even endeavours
to find game. He is a very powerful
animal, and is frequently used either in small
packs, or with other dogs, to hunt the wild
boar, deer, or wolf, the latter of which a good
hound will kill singlehanded. But it is the
deer principally that he hunts. When used
in coursing, he is slipped in the same manner
as is practised in this country.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Scotch Greyhound</i>, (<i>Canis Graius
Scotius.</i>)—This dog, in point of form, is similar
in all respects to the common grey-hound,
differing only in its being of a larger size, and
the hair being wiry, in place of that beautiful
sleekness which distinguishes the coat of the
other. Their colour for the most part is of a
reddish brown or sandy hue, although they are
sometimes to be met with quite black. I saw
some powerful animals of this description in
the north of Ireland, in possession of the small
farmers and peasants of the mountainous districts.
They are said to be the only dogs which
are capable of catching the hares which inhabit
those mountain ranges,—the common greyhound
wanting strength for such a laborious
chace. These dogs in Ireland are almost universally
dark iron grey, with very strong
grizzly hair, and are much superior in many
respects to any I have seen in Scotland. I remark
a peculiarity in those Irish hounds, which
was that of having very small but extremely
brilliant and penetrating hazel-coloured eyes;
their teeth were also very strong and long.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are informed by Topsel, that the dog was
used for tracing thieves in Scotland, and also on
the borders of England, and that he had an
excellent sense of smelling. Even at the present
day he has the sense in a more acute state
than the common greyhound; and it is probable
that in early times he was still more distinguished
by an active power of scent.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Italian Greyhound</i>, (<i>Canis Graius
Italianus.</i>)—Is about half the size of the
common greyhound, and is perfectly similar
in form. His shape is exquisitely beautiful,
and he has a most delicate appearance. The
general colour of this handsome dog is a pale
mouse brown, sable, or white. The skin is
very sleek, and the hair extremely fine and
short. He does not thrive well in Great
Britain, the climate being too cold for his delicate
constitution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Italian greyhound is too small to have
sufficient speed for taking a hare, and is in consequence
never employed in the chace, his
principal use being an attendant on the great.
In Italy, men of rank are frequently seen either
walking or riding followed by several of these
dogs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Turkish Greyhound</i>, (<i>Canis Egyptius</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—This is a diminutive variety of the
greyhound, probably reduced to its smallest
size from the influence of climate. It is little
more than half the bulk of the Italian greyhound,
and like the same animal, both in this
country and in Italy, is an attendant on people
of rank, and usually kept as a pet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Turkish greyhound is quite naked,
with only a few scattered hairs on its tail.
The colour of the skin is leaden or black, and
has all the appearance of leather. His ears
are long and erect. This dog is said to possess
great attachment to his master. We have
heard of one which belonged to a pacha who
was beheaded, that laid itself down on the
body of his murdered master and expired.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that the greyhound of Great Britain
when taken to Turkey, quickly degenerates,
and becomes a poor spiritless animal,
without the least desire for sporting. This is
not peculiar to the greyhound, but extends to
all dogs brought from temperate climates.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sonnini, who travelled through the Ottoman
empire, mentions that he endeavoured
by every means in his power to ascertain whether
this singular dog was really a native of
Turkey, but that he had sought in vain for it
in that country. He further remarks, that it
is not in the temperate climate of Turkey
that dogs lose their hair, nor even under the
burning sun of Egypt.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The breeding of the greyhound is recommended
to be from the well tried and best
bitches, as an indifferent dog was supposed
from such a cross, to get better whelps than if
the excellence was inverted, and the bitch but
tolerable; the surest way to have the whelps
excellent, is to have both sire and dam good,
and not to exceed four years old; if any inequality
in their age, it is recommended to
be on the bitch’s side, provided the dog be
young.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Wood Grouse</i>, <i>Cock of the Wood</i>,
or <i>Capercalzie</i>.—(<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>Legrand Coq de Bruyère</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird
is as large as the turkey, is about two feet nine
inches in length, and weighs from twelve to
fifteen pounds. The bill is very strong, convex,
and of a horn colour; over each eye there
is a naked skin, of a bright red colour; the eyes
are hazel; the nostrils are small, and almost hid
under a covering of short feathers, which extend
under the throat, and are there much
longer than the rest, and of a black colour; the
head and neck are elegantly marked with
small transverse lines of black and grey, as are
also the back and wings, but more irregularly;
the breast is black, richly glossed with green
on the upper part, and mixed with a few
white feathers on the belly and thighs; the
sides are marked like the neck, the tail consists
of eighteen feathers, which are black, those
on the sides are marked with a few white spots;
the legs are very stout, and covered with brown
feathers; the toes are furnished on each side
with a strong pectinated membrane. The female
is considerably less than the male, and
differs from him greatly in her colours; her
throat is red; the transverse bars on the head,
neck, and back, are red and black; the breast
is of a pale orange colour; belly barred with
orange and black, the top of each feather
white; the back and wings are mottled with
reddish brown and black; the scapulars tipped
with white; the tail is of a deep rust colour,
barred with black, and tipped with white.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful kind is found chiefly in high
mountainous regions, and is very rare in Great
Britain. Mr. Pennant mentions one, as an
uncommon instance, which was shot near
Inverness. It was formerly met with in Ireland,
but is now supposed to be extinct there.
In Russia, Sweden, and other northern countries,
it is very common: it lives in the forests
of pine with which those countries abound,
and feeds on the cones of fir trees, which, at
some seasons, give an unpleasant flavour to its
flesh, so as to render it unfit for the table; it
likewise eats various kinds of plants and berries,
particularly the juniper. Early in the
spring the season for pairing commences;
during this period the cock places himself on
an eminence, where he displays a variety of
pleasing attitudes; the feathers on his head
stand erect, his neck swells, his tail is displayed,
and his wings trail almost on the
ground; his eyes sparkle, and the scarlet patch
on each side of his head assumes a deeper dye;
at the same time he utters his well-known cry,
which has been compared to the sound produced
by the whetting of a scythe; it may be
heard at a considerable distance, and never
fails to draw round him his faithful mates.
The female lays from eight to sixteen eggs,
which are white, spotted with yellow, and
larger than those of the common hen: for
this purpose she chooses some secret spot,
where she can sit in security: she covers her
eggs carefully over with leaves, when she is
under the necessity of leaving them in search
of food. The young follow the hen as soon
as they are hatched, sometimes with part of
the shell attached to them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Black Grouse</i>, <i>Black Game</i>, or
<i>Black Cock</i>.—(<i>Tetrao Tetrix</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le
Coq de Bruyère à queue fourchue</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This
bird, though not larger than the common
hen, weighs nearly four pounds: its
length is about one foot ten inches, breadth
two feet nine. The bill is black, the eyes
dark blue; below each eye there is a spot of
dirty white colour, and above a larger one, of
a bright scarlet, which extends almost to the
top of the head; the general colour of the
plumage is a deep black, richly glossed with
blue on the neck and rump; the lesser wing
coverts are dusky brown; the greater are white,
which extends to the ridge of the wing, forming
a spot of that colour on the shoulder when
the wing is closed; the quills are brown, the
lower parts and tips of the secondaries are
white, forming a bar of white across the wing;
there is likewise a spot of white on the bastard
wing; the feathers of the tail are almost square
at the ends, and, when spread out, form a curve
on each side; the under tail coverts are of a
pure white; the legs and thighs are of a dark
brown colour, mottled with white; the toes
are toothed on the edges like those of former
species. In some of our specimens the nostrils
were thickly covered with feathers, whilst
in others they were quite bare, probably owing
to the different ages of the birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds, like the former, are found
chiefly in the high situations in the northern
parts of our island; they are common in Russia,
Siberia, and other northern countries:
they feed on various kinds of berries and other
fruits, the produce of wild and mountainous
places: in summer they frequently come
down from their lofty situations for the sake
of feeding on corn. They do not pair, but, on
the return of spring, the males assemble in
great numbers at their accustomed resorts, on
the tops of the high and heathy mountains,
when the contest for superiority commences,
and continues with great bitterness till the
vanquished are put to flight: the victors, being
left in possession of the field, place themselves
on an eminence, clap their wings, and with
loud cries give notice to their females, who
immediately resort to the spot. It is said
that each cock has two or three hens, which
seem particularly attached to him. The female
is about one-third less than the male,
and differs from him considerably in colour,
her tail is likewise much less forked. She
makes an artless nest on the ground, where
she lays six or eight eggs of a yellowish colour,
with freckles and spots of a rusty brown. The
young cocks, at first, resemble the mother,
and do not acquire their male garb till towards
the end of autumn, when the plumage gradually
changes to a deeper colour, and assumes
that of a bluish black, which it afterwards
retains.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red Grouse</i>, <i>Red Game</i>, <i>Gorcock</i> or
<i>Moorcock</i>.—(<i>Tetrao Scoticus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>L’Altagas</i>,
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The length of this bird is fifteen
inches; the weight about nineteen ounces.
The bill is black; the eyes hazel; the nostrils
shaded with small red and black feathers; at
the base of the lower bill there is a white spot
on each side; the throat is red: each eye is
arched with a large naked spot, of a bright
scarlet colour; the whole upper part of the
body is beautifully mottled with deep red and
black, which gives it the appearance of tortoise-shell;
the breast and belly are of a purplish
hue, crossed with small dusky lines; the
tail consists of sixteen feathers of equal length,
the four middlemost barred with red, the others
black; the quills are dusky; the legs are
clothed with soft white feathers down to the
claws, which are strong, and of a light colour.
The female is somewhat less; the naked skin
above each eye is not so conspicuous, and the
colours of her plumage in general are much
lighter than those of the male.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is found in great plenty in the
wild, heathy, and mountainous tracts in the
northern counties of England: it is likewise
common in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland.
Mr. Pennant supposes it to be peculiar
to Britain; those found in the mountainous
parts of France, Spain, Italy, and elsewhere,
as mentioned by M. Buffon, are very probably
varieties of this kind, and no doubt would
breed with it. It is to be wished that attempts
were more frequently made to introduce a
greater variety of these useful birds into this
country, to stock our waste and barren moors
with a rich fund of delicate and wholesome
food; but till the legislature shall alter or
abrogate our very unequal and injudicious
game laws, there hardly remains a single hope
for the preservation of such birds of this species
as we now have.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red grouse pair in spring; the female lays
eight or ten eggs on the ground. The young
ones follow the hen the whole summer; as
soon as they have attained their full size, they
unite in flocks of forty or fifty, and are then
exceedingly shy and wild.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>White Grouse</i>, <i>White Game</i> or <i>Ptarmigan</i>.—(<i>Tetrao
Lagopus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Lagopéde</i>,
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird is nearly the same
size as the red grouse. Its bill is black; the
upper parts of its body are of a pale brown
or ash colour, mottled with small dusky spots
and bars; the bars on the head and neck are
somewhat broader, and are mixed with white;
the under parts are white, as are also the
wings, excepting the shafts of the quills, which
are black. This is its summer dress, which
in winter is changed to a pure white, excepting
that in the male there is a black line between
the cill and the eye. The tail consists
of sixteen feathers; the two middle ones are
ash-coloured in summer and white in winter;
the next two are slightly marked with white
near the ends; the rest are wholly black;
the upper tail coverts are long, and almost
cover the tail. The white grouse is fond of
lofty situations, where it braves the severest
cold; it is found in most of the northern parts
of Europe, even as far as Greenland. In this
country it is to be met with on the summits
of some of our highest hills, chiefly in
the Highlands of Scotland, in the Hebrides
and Orkneys, and sometimes, but rarely, on
the lofty hills of Cumberland and Wales.
Buffon, speaking of this bird, says that it
avoids the solar heat, and prefers the biting
frosts on the tops of mountains; for as the
snow melts on the sides of the mountains, it
constantly ascends till it gains the summit,
where it forms holes and burrows in the snow.
They pair at the same time as the red grouse;
the female lays eight or ten eggs, which are
white spotted with brown. She makes no
nest, but deposits them on the ground. In
winter they fly in flocks, and are so little accustomed
to the sight of man, that they are
easily shot or taken in a snare. They feed on
the wild productions of the hills, which sometimes
give the flesh a bitter but not unpalatable
taste; it is dark-coloured, and, according to
M. Buffon, has somewhat the flavour of the
hare.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Hunting for grouse during the basking hour
of the day, is rigidly prohibited by all gentlemen
who compile sporting directories; and
yet every shooter knows, that at these proscribed
hours himself is commonly on the
moors. Morning and evening, when the birds
are on foot in search of food, is undoubtedly
preferable to the duller portion of the day,
when they are accustomed to indulge in a
<i>siesta</i>. But, generally, some considerable distance
must be travelled before the sportsman
can reach his beat from his quarters. The
morning is consumed on horseback or in the
shooting-cart; the same road must be again
accomplished before night; and hence the
middle of the day is, of necessity, the portion
devoted to pursuit of game.</p>

<p class='c006'>To find the birds when, satisfied with food,
they leave the moor to bask in some favourite
haunt, requires both patience and experience;
and here the mountain-bred sportsman proves
his superiority over the less-practised shooter.
The packs then lie closely, and occupy a small
surface on some sunny brow or sheltered hollow.
The best nosed dogs will pass within a
few yards, and not acknowledge them; and
patient hunting, with every advantage of the
wind, must be employed to enable the sportsman
to find grouse at this dull hour.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if close and judicious hunting be necessary,
the places to be beaten are comparatively
few, and the sportsman’s eye readily detects
the spot where the pack is sure to be discovered.
He leaves the open feeding-grounds for
heathery knowes and sheltered valleys; and
while the uninitiated wearies his dogs in vain
over the hill-side, where the birds, hours before,
might have been expected, the older
sportsman profits by his experience, and seldom
fails in discovering the dell or hillock,
where, in fancied security, the indolent pack is
reposing.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gruel</span>, <i>s.</i> Food made by boiling oatmeal in water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gruel is a useful drink for horses on many
occasions, and, when made carefully, sweetened
with treacle or sugar, and sometimes seasoned
with salt, they will often drink it, and save the
trouble of drenching. It is a good vehicle for
such medicines as are of a stimulating or acrimonious
nature, such as oil of turpentine.
Gruel is made either with oatmeal or grits,
barley meal or pearl barley, fine wheat flour or
arrow root; it may be made also with sago,
salep or tapioca; either of these to be boiled
in water, and, for some purposes, in milk and
broth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gruel is often made merely by stirring some
oatmeal into warm water, but it is better when
boiled: and when grits or pearl barley are
employed, it should be boiled a short time, and
the first water thrown away; the gruel will
then be free from an unpleasant taste which
these substances contract by keeping: when
they are first crushed or bruised, the gruel is
richer, and more expeditiously made. Gruel
is a useful restorative for weak or convalescent
horses, being very nutritious and easy of digestion;
perhaps nothing is more nutritious than
wheat flour gruel made with milk and sweetened
with sugar. In India it is a common
practice to give horses strong broths, thickened
with grain or flour, and seasoned with pepper
or other spices, when they work hard, or as a
restorative cordial. Infusion of malt makes a
good nutritive drink for horses; but good
<i>sweet</i> grits make an excellent gruel. Oatmeal
is sometimes musty, and gruel made with
it has often some degree of bitterness. When
gruel is given as a cordial restorative after hard
work, a little beer and ginger may, on some
occasions, be added. Horses are very nice
in their drinking, therefore the gruel should
be made in a clean saucepan, free from the
smell of meat, smoke, or fat. For some purposes,
or where it is inconvenient to boil the
gruel, a little oat, barley, or wheat meal, may
be stirred into warm or cold water. This in
Ireland is termed a <i>white drink</i>.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is rather larger than the common
species. Bill, irides, and legs red; the upper
part of the head is red-brown; greyish on the
forehead; chin and throat white, encircled
with black; over each eye a band of white;
fore part and sides of the neck cinereous,
spotted with black; back, wings, and rump,
grey-brown; breast pale ash-colour; belly
rufous; sides marked with linear streaks of
black, white, and orange; the tail composed
of sixteen feathers of a rufous-colour, except
the six middle ones, which are more or less
grey-brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The habits of this species differ somewhat
from the common partridge. This frequently
perches on a tree, and will breed in confinement,
which the other is never known to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel says that they are now plentiful
near Oxford, the Marquis of Hertford having
imported many thousand eggs, which were
hatched under hens, and liberated; and so
early as 1777, he says he saw a covey, consisting
of fourteen of these birds, several of
which he shot; many coveys may be found
in the neighbourhood of Ipswich, on preserved
manors, where they seem to prefer the waste
heathy ground to corn-fields, the favourite
haunts of the common species.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a curious fact, that the Guernsey partridge
should be so much changed in its nature
by passing the British Channel from Picardy
to Kent, not above the third of a degree in
difference of latitude, and yet, prolific as they
are on the south side of the Channel, they
become less inclined to propagation, even in
the same sort of soil, in the north, which has
rendered every exertion to naturalise them to
any extent ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is very plentiful in Spain and
Portugal, frequenting the vineyards, especially
in winter. Bechstein informs us that they
have been found in Austria and Bohemia,
where, however, they are, as with us, very
rare in a wild state. Woody and mountainous
countries, he adds, seem to please them
more than the plains. Wheat and corn of
all sorts, with the leaves of several plants,
and insects in turn, furnish them with their
food; they never become so familiar as the
quail, but sufficiently so to breed in the
aviary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Why this should be called Guernsey partridge
we cannot imagine, since we are credibly
informed it is very rare in that island. The
common species breed there, but are scarce;
whether this ever bred there is uncertain,
though they are known to breed in the island
of Jersey. It is also found in various parts of
Asia and Africa, and is called by the name of
the Red-legged Partridge.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Guinea-hen</span>, <i>s.</i> A small Indian hen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pintada, or Guinea Hen, has been
said to unite the character and properties of
the pheasant and the turkey. It is about the
size of the common hen, but standing high
upon its legs gives it the appearance of a
larger size. The back is round, with the tail
turned downwards, like the partridge. It is
an active, restless, and courageous bird, and
will even attack the turkey, although so much
above its size. The Guinea fowls assimilate
perfectly with the common species, in habits
and in kinds of food; but have this peculiarity,
that the cocks and hens are so nearly
alike, it is difficult to distinguish them.
They have also a peculiar gait and cry, or
chuckling. The head is covered with a kind
of casque, with wattles under the bill, and
the whole plumage is either black or dark
grey, speckled with regular and uniform white
spots. The pintada is generally supposed to
be a native of Guinea, whence its additional
name; but it is in equal plenty in America.
In those countries it perches on trees, and, in
a wild state, makes its nest in the holes of
the palm tree. It is gregarious, and often
found in large flocks. Like the peacock, it
may be said to be universally domesticated.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is sometimes, but not invariably, a
distinction of colour in certain parts, between
the cock and hen pintada; the manner and
gait of the cock, however, soon distinguish
him. However long domesticated, these birds
retain some part of their original wild habits,
and will stray in search of a place in which
to drop their eggs, without any apparent solicitude
as to their security. They lay an
abundance of eggs, smaller than those of the
common hen, speckled, resembling wild,
rather than common, eggs. It sometimes
happens that they are everlasting layers, in
which case, and indeed generally, it is most
profitable to hatch pintadas under a common
hen, which will cover an additional number
of those small eggs. The chicks are extremely
tender, and should not be hatched
too early in the spring; a sudden change of
the wind in March, to the north-east, has
destroyed many a brood of them.—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gull</span> (<i>Larus canus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>), <i>s.</i> A sea bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species weighs fifteen or sixteen
ounces; length about seventeen inches; bill
yellow; irides hazel. The head, neck, tail,
and under parts of the body, white; the back,
scapulars, and wing coverts, ash-colour—the
former tipped with white; the primary quills
black; the two or three first have a spot of
white across the ends, but the tips are black—the
rest are tipped with white; the secondaries,
like the back, tipped with white; legs dull
white, or tinged with green.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is one of the most plentiful species
found on our coast. They breed upon the
ledges of the rocks close to the sea-shore,
sometimes not far above the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eggs are two or three in number, of a
dull olive-brown, blotched with dusky, the size
of a small hen’s. When disturbed they are exceedingly
clamorous, and not much alarmed
by being shot at. They are frequently seen
in winter, at a considerable distance from the
coast, and in severe weather they flock with
the rooks. They follow the plough for the
sake of the larvæ of the chaffer (<i>Scarabæus
melolontha</i>), and of worms. The young are
brown, mottled with white, the tail having a
brown bar near the end; the white commences
in the second year, and the spots on the wing
and the bar on the tail gradually disappear.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agilis.</i> You seem very decided as to your
opinion of the relative value between London-made
guns, and those at a much less price
manufactured in the country. In what qualities
do you suppose the advantages to consist,
and how do you prove these qualities may
not exist as well in a country as a London-made
gun? Pray state your opinion at length.
I have never heard the matter fully discussed,
though I have certainly seen much confidence
shown by the advocates of each.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peritus.</i> The value is derived from four
causes: goodness of raw material, temper,
close fitting, and adaptation of the several
parts to each other, in shape, position, and
substance, as fittest to fulfil the duties for
which they are separately and collectively intended,
in the production or convenience, permanence,
and effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us consider this in the same light in
which we should view any other branch of
merchandise; first, it must be conceded, that
wherever the best maker may be, there the
highest quality of produce will be found; it is
<i>likely</i>, therefore, that the material offered to
the London maker will be superior to that
brought for sale to the comparatively small
consumer (in price if not in quantity) in the
country; the well-known competition existing
between all London makers, renders it probable
that he will use his utmost exertions to
secure this advantage in the highest degree.
Secondly: with regard to temper there are
two things to be considered, namely, the degree
of hardness required to prevent a movement
from wearing itself away; and next,
with reference to its action upon other parts
in contact with it, as in some machines we
have wheels bushed with brass to diminish
friction. Great tact is requisite in this matter;
first, to know the temper required; secondly,
to give it. The workman who can
effect this, is valuable in proportion to his
knowledge; is he likely to remain in the
country at low wages, or to become the servant
of the highest bidder? Close-fitting:
an accurate eye and practised hand are absolutely
necessary to effect this, which is a main
cause of permanence in a gun-lock, as thereby
all parts bear their even proportion of stress,
and (the temper and position of all parts being
correct) an even wear is the result. But the
most practised workman requires an extension
of time, in some degree proportionate to the
goodness of his work, comparing it with that
of others less skilful, and this adds to the
price; the London maker can best afford to
pay that price.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, the fitness of the parts for the duties
they have to fulfil. It may be said here,
that the greater the quantity of material manufactured,
the greater degree of knowledge
must be attained by the manufacturer. Assuming
then that the superiority of material
is shown, we have to prove that the cheap
manufacturer either cannot, by quantity, obtain
such a knowledge of the requisite shape
of the parts of a gun, as, when put together,
shall make it equal to that of a London maker;
or, if in possession of that knowledge,
cannot, in the same degree, avail himself of
it. Supposing, then, that he does take the
pattern of the most approved shape for his
guide (a circumstance we find not to be commonly
the case), or even in the absence of
equal opportunities of comparison, that great
spur to improvement, can invent a better shape
than others, this can only refer to the handling
of the gun; its working, as before shown,
depending so much upon material, temper,
and putting together, that it possesses the form
of goodness only, without the reality; and as
well might you expect to procure an article of
dress equally convenient, lasting, and fitting,
of a country tailor, as that which may be had
of a first-rate workman in London, as procure
an article of the nature of a gun of the same
degree of excellence in the country as in town.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agilis.</i> Have you not omitted the consideration,
that all workmen can work cheaper
in the country, from the diminished price of
food and house-rent, than in large towns; as
also the enormous profits made by London
gun-makers?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peritus.</i> The advantage you here mention,
does not come into play—it is a matter
of consideration for the workman alone. I
would admit it, did I consider that the workman
himself was ill-paid, but the contrary is
the fact. It has already been conceded, that,
although a gun progresses in value as it progresses
in price, yet not in an equal ratio, and
part of the difference consists in the greater
(I might most say undue) pay, in proportion
to his labour, which a first-rate workman can
procure; and secondly, in the great credit
which any one maker may obtain over others
from the known excellence of his work:
these latter are two little monopolies, and must
be paid for while they exist; but it is your
business to fix a limit upon this by selecting
from the best makers, and procuring the most
for your money; and you may be certain, that
although large manufactories can be carried
on with greater advantage in the country, in
circumstances where moderate ability is required,
and many hands used, and machinery
can also be called into play upon the same
terms, yet superior manual dexterity will
always overcome the difference of dearness of
living and present itself where there is and
ever must be the greatest mart, and most
continued as well as highest bidders for it;
to wit, in that place where the manufacture
to be produced is in the highest credit and
perfection. And as these two will, therefore,
continue to operate upon each other, the demand
for guns and the perfection of their manufacture,
will draw the best workmen, and
they will again produce the most perfect guns:
and London will thus continue the best mart
for the buyer as well as the seller, until some
other city spring up, where the purchasers of
the article become more numerous, and the
talents of the workmen more appreciated.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>That our times should be as far distinguished
for increased effect and superior elegance
in the formation of fire-arms, as for
any other mechanical improvement, will be
admitted by all but the most prejudiced of
the old school. Antique gunners may still be
found, who are obstinate in preferring the
flint to the percussion plan. But any person
who has suffered the disappointments that the
best guns on the former principle will entail
upon those who carry them, and particularly
in wet and stormy weather, will freely admit
the wonderful advantages that simple and effective
invention, the copper-cap, confers upon
the modern sportsman. The misery entailed
upon the man who in rain and storm attempts
to load and discharge a flint gun, may be
reckoned among the worst upon the human
catalogue; and if he who has suffered repeated
disappointments of eternal misses and
dilatory explosions from a thick flint and a
damp pan, tried the simple and elegant improvement
now in general use, he would
abandon the stone gun for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been said that gun-making is only
brought to perfection in London, and that the
Irish are not able to compete with their English
rivals. I am, I confess, decidedly partial
to a London gun; and while I admit that I
have occasionally met with excellent fire-arms
produced by Dublin makers, yet they are, in
finish and elegance, generally behind those
which one gets from any of the leading artists
in the great metropolis. To point to any particular
name among the host of London makers,
would be absurd. From more than a dozen a
person will be certain of obtaining a first-rate
implement; and from the Mantons, Purdy,
Egg, and many others, guns of the most efficient
qualities and beautiful finish will be procured.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Trial between French and English Guns.</i>—We
then made trial of some guns of the manufactory,
and it may be reasonably supposed
the best were selected. I had only brought
two of my own, one of which was my coach
gun, not more than two feet long, but even this
far surpassed those produced by the manufactory.
They made some shots at the distance
of ninety-eight yards, but did not succeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was afterwards agreed to have a full and
fair trial of my guns against the manufactory,
and each party was naturally anxious for success.
The Poker, or Bonaparte, as the gun
is termed, opened the ball, and she threw her
shot so exactly, that the French admitted,
“une mouche ne pouvoit pas l’echapper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Theirs in return failed, after which they assayed
about four others. The next was my air
gun, at ninety-three yards, against their rifle.
I shot within an inch of their mark though it
was not fully pumped; the day was extremely
sultry, and yet my next shot was still more
exact.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next trial was my double rifle, which
was, apparently, greatly in their favour, as the
sight to a single rifle is far more accurate. On
preparing to reload, I found that, owing to some
mistake, the loader and the bullet moulds
were either lost or mislaid. However, some
bullets were found to fit, and, after loading with
powder merely by guess, I made eight shots,
each sufficient to pierce through a deer’s head,
and one even touched the edge of the white.</p>

<p class='c006'>We had several other trials both with rifles
and air guns, but the result afforded a convincing
proof of the superiority of the English manufactures:
several bets were made on this occasion,
and general Beaumont, the appointed
judge, decided impartially in favour of my guns,
but, out of respect for the civilities I had received,
I ordered a single and double barrelled
gun of the best make.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The mounting of their guns at Versailles is
certainly excellent, and the carving of their
stocks is most beautifully conceived and is capitally
executed, but their barrels are not fitted
in that workman-like manner which constitutes
a striking excellence in the English manufactories.
They are also very inferior to my
countrymen in the art of browning, and in the
construction of their locks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manufactory at Versailles was under
the patronage of the First Consul, and he frequently
ordered the most costly pieces, as presents
for foreign princes, or general officers; one
gun was produced which was then completing
for the Consul, at the price of eight hundred
guineas. The sum was certainly very great,
but I remember receiving a fowling piece as a
present from Lord Rockingham, which cost his
lordship four hundred guineas, in consequence
of my having killed a sparrow, which had
perched on the top of Wentworth house.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Anno</i> 1712, a brass gun was advertised to
be shot for, at Hoxton, which was in the shape
of a walking cane, might be used either as a gun
or pistol, and which contained a telescope, a
dial on the head, and a perpetual almanac.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Directions for cleaning guns.</i>—Let your
barrels be first washed perfectly clean with
cold, and then fill each of them with hot
water; which, by the time it has nearly run
out at the touch-holes, will accelerate their
being wiped dry, as much as though boiling
water had been used; and before they have
completely discharged the water, stop the muzzles
and touch-holes; and after shaking it up
and down in the barrels, turn it out at the
muzzles, by which means you will effectually
stir up and expel any extraneous matter that
may have lodged in the bottom of the chambers.
To ascertain this, hold them with the
touch-holes towards the window, and (with the
breechings which I have recommended) you
will, by looking into each muzzle, plainly perceive
the light in the chamber appearing like
one dot surrounded by two (and sometimes
three) rings. I have recommended washing
guns with cold water, from having found that
it always more readily removes the foulness
occasioned by the powder, which, from sudden
heat, is apt, at first, to dry and adhere more
closely to the calibre: whereas, with cold
water, it remains in a moist state, and immediately
mixes.</p>

<p class='c006'>In cleansing barrels, a little fine sand may
not be amiss, and will generally answer in removing
the lead. If hot water should be required
for this purpose, the gun may be scoured
with it, after having been washed with cold.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gun-makers generally apply hot water to
clean the barrels if much leaded, and afterwards
finish with cold; but cold water is best,
and the tow being strewed over with steel-filings,
will better remove the lead, and at the
same time do no injury to the inside polish of
the barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every shooter should have the breeches of
his guns taken out at least twice a year. To
undo them without springing the barrels, let
him use tallow and wax mixed, and anoint the
threads; steeping the barrels in warm water
before trying to unscrew them; any fault may
be easily discovered by thus inspecting the
barrels.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If a stupid fellow wedges dry tow into your
gun, with the cleaning rod, pour boiling water
on it, and the rod may then be turned round
and drawn out. I remember this occurred
with a large punt-gun, at which I caught four
men hauling away most unmercifully, but to
no effect; I luckily came by and saved the
destruction of the cleaning-rod, if not the injury
of the barrel, by suggesting this simple
contrivance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gunpowder</span>, <i>s.</i> The powder put into guns to be fired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gunpowder is composed of very light charcoal,
sulphur, and well refined saltpetre. The
powder used by sportsmen in shooting game is
generally composed of six parts of saltpetre,
one of charcoal, and one of sulphur; but these
proportions, as well as the introduction of other
ingredients, and the sizes of the grains, are
undoubtedly varied by the different manufacturers
in the composition of the powders of
the same denominations, and are always kept
profoundly secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>The materials are put into a wooden trough,
where they are ground together, to render the
contact of the nitrous and combustible particles
intimate and equal throughout the whole
mass. The mixture is occasionally sprinkled
with water to form an amalgam, which is
afterwards granulated, and to prevent the finer
particles of the sulphur and the charcoal from
flying off, which would necessarily alter the
proportion of the composition. The powder-makers
employ more or less time in the operation
of grinding, in proportion to the quantity
and quality of the saltpetre. When they
conceive that the ingredients are properly
mixed together, they from the paste form
these little grains, which, being dried, obtain
the name of gunpowder.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two general methods of examining
gunpowder, one with regard to its <i>purity</i>,
the other with regard to its <i>strength</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its <i>purity</i> is known by laying two or three
little heaps near each other upon white paper,
and firing one of them. For if this takes fire
readily and the smoke rises upright, without
leaving any dross or feculent matter behind,
and without burning the paper, or firing the
other heaps, it is esteemed a sign that the sulphur
and nitre were well purified, that the
coal was good, and that the ingredients were
thoroughly incorporated together; but if the
other heaps also take fire at the same time, it
is presumed, that either common salt was
mixed with the nitre, or that the coal was not
well ground, or the whole mass not well beat
or mixed together; and if either the nitre or
sulphur be not well purified the paper will be
black or spotted.</p>

<p class='c006'>To determine the <i>strength</i> of powder, dry
it perfectly and ascertain how many sheets of
paper it will drive the shot through at the
distance of ten or twelve yards. In this trial
we should be careful to employ the <i>same sized
shot</i> in each experiment—the quantity both
of the shot and the powder being regulated
by exact weight, otherwise we cannot, even in
this experiment, arrive to any certainty in
comparing the strength of different powders,
or of the same powder at different times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel, in speaking of gunpowder,
gives the following recipe for increasing its
strength. We entirely coincide in his opinion
that it is quite unnecessary to augment the
force of modern gunpowder, and insert the
directions rather for the experimentalist than
the sportsman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The following method of increasing the
force of gunpowder one-third in proportion to
its original goodness, was discovered by a physician
of Fogano, in Tuscany, whose name
was Francesco. To every pound of powder
add four ounces of quick lime, fresh and well
pulverised; let the whole be shaken until the
mixture is perfect, and afterwards kept for
use in a close stopped vessel. To the chemists
is left to decide upon what principle the
lime acts in strengthening the powder. The
experiment is said to be certain. It is necessary
to add, that the powder used in priming
must be unmixed with lime. Without artificially
augmenting the strength of gunpowder,
that made by Messrs. Pigou and Andrews
will be found excellent; and it is to be feared,
if a gentleman cannot kill with the above, no
chemical preparation will much assist his endeavours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The concluding observations are taken from

many years ago, and entitled “An Essay on
Shooting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Powder ought to be kept very dry; every
degree of moisture injures it. Good powder,
however, does not readily imbibe moisture;
and, perhaps, there is no greater proof of the
bad quality of powder, than its growing damp
quickly when exposed to the air. This readiness
to become moist, depends upon the saltpetre
employed in the composition not having
been freed from the common salt it contains
in its crude state, and which, in consequence,
has a very strong attraction for watery particles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Powder may acquire a small degree of
dampness, and be freed from it again by drying,
without much injury to its quality. But
if the moisture is considerable, the saltpetre
is dissolved, and the intimate mixture of the
several ingredients thereby entirely destroyed.
Drying powder with too great a heat also injures
it; for there is a degree of heat, which,
although not sufficient to fire the powder, will
yet dissipate the sulphur, and impair the composition
by destroying the texture of the grains.
The heat of the sun is, perhaps, the greatest
it can with safety be exposed to, and, if properly
managed, is sufficient for the purpose;
when this cannot be had, the heat of a fire,
regulated to the same degree, may be employed;
and for this end, a heated pewter
plate is perhaps as good as anything, because
pewter retains so moderate a heat, that there
can be little danger of spoiling the powder by
producing the consequences before-mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is observable that damp powder produces
a remarkable foulness in the fowling-piece
after firing, much beyond what arises
from an equal quantity of dry powder; and
this seems to arise from the diminution of the
activity of the fire in the explosion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unless the sportsman is <i>very particular
indeed</i> in the mode of keeping his powder, we
would recommend him always to air it and
his flask before he takes the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>Flasks made of copper or tin are much
better for keeping powder in than those made
of leather, or than small casks; the necks of
these should be small, and well stopped with
cork.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>To Prepare Hackles.</i>—First, pick and
bunch them, and be careful they are the feathers
of old cocks, otherwise they will not be
worth a farthing when dyed, as they will all
curl in on each edge, and shrivel up in the
points. Bunch each colour by themselves,
and throw them into a basin of hot water.
Take them out one by one, and rub soap on
them downwards, dipping them occasionally
in the water till you see they are clean; dip
them in a weak solution of alum water, and
then wash them very well in clean water, and
they are done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every shade of red will come out of the
dye, differing in colour, whether olive or cinnamon.
For olives, ground richly in turmeric,
and throw into the same liquor the size
of a hazel nut of best madder. Boil in that a
quarter of an hour, and throw in a small bit of
copperas, first lifting out your hackles till the
copperas is dissolved, and when the liquor
boils, throw in your feathers for an instant,
and you have fine olives. Black hackles dyed
in this way, become a rich green olive, or
dooghadoo. For cinnamons ground richly in
turmeric, all red hackles; then put in two
teaspoonfuls of cochineal, ground or powdered,
boil them in that for a quarter of an hour,
then put in one teaspoonful of best brazil
dust, and boil for a quarter of an hour, and
you have fine cinnamons. Any dirty tawneys,
or grizzle hackles may be dyed in this, and
it will improve them much. There is a sort
of reddish cuckoo hackle that may be dyed in
turmeric and madder, as in the olive hackle
process, but not to have any copperas. There
is also a yellowish white with a black vein in
the middle, and edged with black. All whites,
natural yellows, or yellowish whites for the
drakes. There is a scald whitish cuckoo hackle
with very little black in it—have nothing
to do with them. All those marked as above
should be dyed in the following way:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Take one chip of young fustic, and two or
three seedy sprigs of French weed; boil in
this till they come to a faint yellow: draw
them, if you wish a bunch of that colour, and
if not, put in one pinch of turmeric, and one
of madder; boil in this for a quarter of an
hour, and I think you will have fine hackles
for the drakes. You have no richness from
the weed, but when you add the turmeric
and madder you have. In every instance except
this, I condemn and forbid the dyeing
with turmeric and young fustic, as it will
ruin every thing that is dyed in it—it gives so
bad a colour.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To stain hackles of a fine rich Gold
Colour.</i>—Ground strongly in turmeric, then
add a tea-spoonful of best madder, boil well
for fifteen minutes, and draw them. Add
then two spoonfuls more of madder, and boil
for the same time, and draw again. Then
add three more, and boil as before; and, lastly,
add six spoonfuls of madder, and boil for half
an hour, and you have four fine shades of gold
colours.—<i>Ancient Recipes.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Haddock</span>, <i>s.</i> A sea fish of the cod kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>The haddock, one of the commonest fishes
in the London markets, begins to be in roe
in the middle of November, and so continues
until the end of January; from that time until
May they are thin tailed, and much out of
season. The grand shoal of haddocks comes
periodically on the Yorkshire coasts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fishermen assert, that when the sea is
rough, haddocks sink down into the ooze and
sand at the bottom, and there shelter themselves
until the storm subsides; their reason
for this assertion is, that in boisterous weather
they take none, and those that are caught immediately
after a storm, have their backs
covered with mud. The bulk of the haddock
is seldom known to exceed fourteen pounds;
these are uncommon, and extremely coarse,
the best for the table weighing from two to
three pounds. The black spot beyond the
gills, is the mark which superstition interprets
to be the impression left by the finger and
thumb of St. Peter, when he took the tribute
money out of the mouth of a fish of this species,
and which has been ever since that miracle
continued to the whole race of haddocks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The haddock taken on the Irish coasts are
much superior to what is found in the English
markets. Those of seven or eight pounds
weight are preferred to smaller fish, being
considered finer and firmer.—<i>Daniel, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hair</span>, <i>s.</i> One of the common teguments of the body; a single hair; any
thing proverbially small; small filaments issuing out of the pores of the
skins of animals, and serving for the most part as a covering. The constituent
parts of hair are animal matter, oil, silex, sulphur, carbonate of
lime, &amp;c.—<i>Crabbe.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Hair that is most proper, is that taken
from a young, healthy, grey, or white stallion,
and which is of a pale transparent water-colour;
that from the middle of the tail is the best.
The hairs should be sorted singly, and the
biggest, roundest, and freest from blemishes,
made up into small bundles; the next sized
hairs, and all that are sound and good, are to
be alike sorted and parcelled out; they are
then to be laid in clean spring water for twelve
hours; after that, washed well, and dried either
with bran, or by hanging them in a room where
the heat of a fire or sun comes (they must not
be placed too near a fire); when dry, they
should be again sorted, and the best done up
five or six score together, with their root-ends
quite equal, and tied round with thread at
both ends and in the middle, and should be
kept in a dry place. Hair must not touch
oil, which will make it hollow and soon decay;
it ought to be kept in parchment. Dipping
it in water every two or three months,
and afterwards slowly drying it, will preserve
it for years.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Sorrel, chestnut, or brown-coloured hairs
are best for ground angling, especially in
muddy waters, as they nearly resemble the
colour of the water; white, grey, or darkish
white hair, is for clear streams. Some use a
pale watery green for weedy rivers in summer.
Black will only do for rivers immediately
flowing from mosses.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To make the hair grow in horses.</i>—When

the part at night; wash off the ointment with

dogs should have their hides rubbed every
day with a hair cloth, or a wisp of straw; this
dislodges the furfuraceous matter of the skin,
and prevents its adhesion, which forms the
first step to mange: it also assists general
circulation, and stands in the stead of exercise.
This practice of rubbing would prove an excellent
substitute for washing in many cases,
particularly where water proves injurious,
which it sometimes does to delicate dogs.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p>THE HARE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The generic character of the hare consists
in its having two front teeth, both above and
below; and the upper pair duplicate, two small
interior ones standing behind the others: the
forefeet with five, and the hinder with four
toes.</p>

<p class='c006'>These animals live entirely on vegetable food,
and are all remarkably timid. They run by a
kind of a leaping-pace, and in walking they use
their hind feet as far as the heel. Their tails
are either very short (called in England scuts),
or else they are entirely without.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>The Common Hare.</i>—This little animal
is found throughout Europe, and indeed in
most of the northern parts of the world. Being
destitute of weapons of defence, it is endowed
by Providence with the passion of fear.
Its timidity is known to every one: it is attentive
to every alarm, and is, therefore, furnished
with ears very long and tubular, which
catch the most remote sounds. The eyes are
so prominent, as to enable the animal to see
both before and behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hare feeds in the evenings, and sleeps
in his form during the day; and as he generally
lies on the ground, he has the feet protected
both above and below, with a thick covering of
hair. In a moonlight evening, many of them
may frequently be seen sporting together, leaping
about and pursuing each other: but the
least noise alarms them, and they then scamper
off, each in a different direction. Their
pace is a kind of gallop, or quick succession of
leaps; and they are extremely swift, particularly
in ascending higher grounds, to which,
when pursued, they generally have recourse,
here their large and strong hind legs are of singular
use to them. In northern regions, where,
on descent of the winter’s snow, they would,
were their summer fur to remain, be rendered
particularly conspicuous to animals of prey,
they change in the autumn their yellow grey
dress, for one perfectly white; and are thus
enabled, in a great measure, to elude their
enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>In more temperate regions, they choose in
winter a form exposed to the south, to obtain
all the possible warmth of that season: and in
summer, when they are desirous of shunning
the hot rays of the sun, they change this for one
with a northerly aspect: but in both cases they
have the instinct of generally fixing upon a
place where the immediately surrounding objects
are nearly the colour of their own bodies.</p>

<p class='c006'>In one hare that a gentleman watched, as
soon as the dogs were heard, though at the distance
of nearly a mile, she rose from her form,
swam across a rivulet, then lay down among
the bushes on the other side, and by this means
evaded the scent of the hounds. When a hare
has been chased for a considerable length of
time, she will sometimes push another from its
seat, and lie down there herself. When hard
pressed, she will mingle with a flock of sheep,
run up an old wall, and conceal herself among
the grass on the top of it, or cross a river several
times at small distances. She never runs
in a line directly forward, but constantly doubles
about, which frequently throws the dogs
out of the scent; and she generally goes against
the wind. It is extremely remarkable that
hares, however frequently pursued by the dogs,
seldom leave the place where they were brought
forth, or that in which they usually sit; and
it is a very common thing to find them after
a long and severe chase, in the same place the
following day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females have not so much strength and
agility as the males; they are, consequently,
more timid, and never suffer the dogs to approach
them so near, before they rise as the
males. They are likewise said to practise more
arts, and double more frequently.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal is gentle, and susceptible even
of education. He does not often, however,
though he exhibits some degree of attachment
to his master, become altogether domestic: for
although taken very young, brought up in the
house, and accustomed to kindness and attention,
no sooner is he arrived at a certain age,
than he generally seizes the first opportunity
of recovering his liberty, and flying to the
fields.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whilst Dr. Townson was at Gottingen, he
had a young hare brought to him, which he took
so much pains with, as to render it more familiar
than these animals commonly are. In the
evenings it soon became so frolicsome, as to
run and jump about his sofa and bed; sometimes
in its play it would leap upon, and pat
him with his forefeet, or whilst he was reading,
even knock the book out of his hand. But
whenever a stranger entered the room, the little
animal always exhibited considerable alarm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Borlase saw a hare that was so familiar
as to feed from the hand, lie under a chair in
a common sitting room, and appear, in every
other respect, as easy and comfortable in its
situation as a lap-dog. It now and then went
out into the garden, but after regaling itself
always returned to the house as its proper habitation.
Its usual companions were a greyhound
and a spaniel, both so fond of hare-hunting,
that they often went out together,
without any person accompanying them. With
these two dogs this tame hare spent its evenings:
they always slept on the same hearth,
and very frequently would rest itself upon
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hares are very subject to fleas. Linnæus
tells us, that cloth made of their fur will attract
these insects, and preserve the wearer from
their troublesome attacks. In India the hare
is hunted for sport, not only with dogs, but
with hawks, and some species of the cat genus.
The flesh, though in esteem among the Romans,
was forbidden by the Druids, and by the Britons
of the early centuries. It is now, though
very black, and dry, and devoid of fat, much
esteemed by the Europeans, on account of its
peculiar flavour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female goes with young about a month;
she generally produces three or four at a litter,
and this about four times in a year. The eyes
of the young ones are open at birth: the dam
suckles them about twenty days, after which
they leave her, and procure their own food.
They make forms at a little distance from each
other, and never go far from the place where
they were brought forth. The hare lives about
eight years.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some believe that hares propagate but once
a year, but, in the author’s opinion, they breed
from February to the end of harvest. The
doe chooses some thick dry brake, high grass,
clover, or standing corn, to kindle in; her
paps come forwarder under her belly, than
those of almost any quadruped; she does not
long suckle her young; if she did, and had
many, the udder would be drawn too big, and
be inconvenient whilst the hare was running;
she brings forth differently from the rabbit,
her offspring being completely formed and
quick-sighted the instant they are dropped.
Among naturalists it is a received notion that
the hare, especially the buck, seldom lives
beyond seven years, and that when either is
killed, another succeeds to occupy its place;
whence is derived the proverb—“The more
hares you kill, the more you will have to hunt;”
for when the buck and doe live undisturbed
together a little time, they suffer no stranger
to reside within their limits. It is also a well
experienced truth, that some places are remarkable
for being seldom without hares, and
others (although as likely, in all appearance,
to harbour them) rarely with any. Whether
it is any particular excellence in the feed, in
the situation for forming advantageously, for
warmth, hearing, or seeing, that induces them
to prefer certain spots to others, or that on the
death of a buck or doe, another succeeds, and
they possess their usual circle, cannot be ascertained,
but the fact is perfectly established.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The first ring a hare takes is generally the
foundation of the ensuing pastime, all the
doubles she afterwards makes are in a great
measure like the first; a hare will go over
great part of trailed land, and visit her works
of the preceding night and morning; sometimes
a buck will take endways over fresh
ground, without offering to return; the doe
usually runs in a circle, unless with young, or
having recently kindled; at such times she
often runs forward, and scarcely ever escapes
with life, being naturally unfit for fatigue:
however, both sexes greatly regulate their
conduct according to the season and weather.
After a rainy night, in a woody country,
neither buck nor doe will keep the cover,
owing to the drops of wet hanging on the
spray; they therefore run the highways or
stony lanes, for as the scent naturally lies
strong, they hold the roads which take the
least; not that a hare judges upon what soil
the scent lies weakest; it is her ears that
chiefly direct her, for the hounds being
oftener at fault on the hard paths than the
turf, she finds herself not so closely pressed,
and is not so much alarmed with the continual
cry of the dogs at her heels. The
louder the cry, the more she is terrified, and
flies the swifter; the certain effect of which
is, a heart broken sooner than with a pack
equal in number and goodness, but who spend
their tongues less free. The same principle
directs the hare to run to the covers in autumn;
when the ground is dry, and the wind cold at
north or east; she then keeps the paths that
are covered with leaves, which are so continually
falling and blowing about, that the
best hounds can carry no scent; her alarms
are consequently short, and she rests contented
where she is least disturbed.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When a hare rises out of form, if she erects
her ears, and at first runs slowly, with her
scut cast over her back, it is surely old and
crafty. When a hare is hunted to her form,
along the hard highways, and feeds far away
from cover, and that her doublings and crossings
are wide and large, it is a buck; for the
does generally keep close to the side of some
cover, and, when going to feed in the corn-fields,
seldom cross over the furrows, but
follow the track of them: when hunted they
turn frequently, use many stratagems, and
rarely leave the country round their seat,
whilst the buck, after two or three turns about
his form, runs straight forward four or five
miles, and then probably squats in some place
where he has before preserved himself. A
buck or jack hare may also be known by his
head being shorter, his ears more grey, his
shoulders redder, and the body being smaller
than the doe, and, at his first starting, by the
whiteness of his hinder parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>They who make a business of hare-finding
(and a very advantageous one it is, in some
counties), are enabled to find them in any
weather, by observing the direction of the
wind. People frequently do not find hares,
from not knowing them in their forms. A
gentleman coursing with his friends, was
shown a hare that was found sitting: “Is
that a hare?” he cried; “then, by Jove, I
found two this morning as we rode along.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>According to the season of the year, the
hare is to be looked for: if it be spring, upon
fallows or green corn; during the autumn, in
stubbles or turnips; in winter they will seat
themselves near houses, in brambles and tufts
of thorns.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Hares will certainly, when hard pressed,
go to vault; that is, take the ground like a
rabbit.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Fecundity of Hares.</i>—A male and female
hare were put together by Lord Ribblesdale,
for a year, when the offspring amounted to
sixty-eight. A couple of rabbits, inclosed for
the same period, produced about three hundred.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Feet of Hares.</i>—Tender feet in dogs are
owing to the softness of that fleshy substance
called the ball of the foot; but nature has to
the hare been singularly liberal in this part by
supplying her with such feet as are not subject
to, and indeed scarcely susceptible of hurt, so
as to incommode her in running. The balls
of her feet, instead of hard flesh, are covered
with strong coarse fur, suited so well for the
purpose, that she never treads easier or to
more advantage than on the hardest beaten
track, or rugged, stony road; the very surface
which cripples a dog she glides over with
pleasure. In a frost she has an evident superiority
to most creatures; the horse does
not at that season take his gallops for fear of
foundering; the greyhound or hound would
in running start all their claws, and tear their
soles to pieces, whilst the hare treads as soft as
if she went on wool.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hare Warren.</i>—The warren should be
paled, and the meuses made of brick; but to any
person making a warren, Mr. Beckford recommends
examining the traps, boxes, and stoppers,
all of which have peculiarities not easy to be
described. His town warren is in a wood of near
thirty acres, and is cut into many walks; a
smaller warren, which would perhaps answer
as well, should have only one walk, and that
round the outside of it. No dog must ever be
allowed to enter it, and traps for stoats and
polecats should be constantly set. Parsley
sown in it will induce the hares to keep at
home. When hares at the end of a season
become shy of the traps from having been
often caught, it will be necessary to drive them
in with spaniels. The warren hares will be
found very thick round the warren, for they
will be unwilling to leave it, and when disturbed
by dogs will immediately go in. The
number of hares which a warren will supply
is hardly to be conceived; but Mr. B. prefers
a warren in the midst of an open country
(which might be stopped close on hunting
days), to the catching hares in traps, and then
turning them down. A warren so situated
would supply the whole country with hares,
which, after one turn round it, would most
probably run straight on end.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>The Varying Hare.</i>—This species has a
very soft fur, which in summer is grey, with a
slight mixture of tawny; the tail is always
white. The ears are shorter, and the legs
more slender than those of the common hare,
and the feet more closely and warmly furred.
In size this animal is somewhat smaller.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides other cold parts of Europe, the
varying hare is found on the tops of the highest
Scotch hills, never descending to the plains.
It never mixes with the last species, though
common in the same neighbourhood. It does
not run fast, and when alarmed takes shelter
in clefts of the rocks.</p>

<p class='c006'>In September it begins to change its grey
coat and resume its white winter dress, in
which only the tips and edges of the ears
and the soles of the feet are black. In the
month of April it again becomes grey. It
is somewhat singular that although this animal
be brought into a house, and even kept in
stoved apartments, yet it still changes its colour
at the same period that it does among its native
mountains.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Hounds for hunting box hares should not
be too fleet, and they are to be hunted like a
pack of fox hounds, as a trap hare runs very
much in the same manner, and will even top
the hedges; Mr. B. concludes his remarks
upon the running of trap hares, with the method
recommended by a gentleman to insure
them to run straight, which was tying a piece
of riband to their ears.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hounds mostly used for hare hunting,
are the deep-tongued, thick-lipped, broad and
long hung southern hounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fleet, sharp-nosed dog, ears narrow,
deep-chested, with thin shoulders, showing a

his shoulders.</p>

<img src='images/i_257.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This dog is now almost universally used in
Great Britain for hare hunting. He was originally
generated in a double cross, between
the small beagle, the southern hound, and the
dwarf fox.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are, however, various harriers produced
by crosses introduced in breeding, dictated
by knowledge and experience, and depending
on the kind of country they hunt in,
and the wish or fancy of the owner of the
pack; all of which are a great alteration in
the blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>The harrier pursues the hare with great
eagerness and speed, allowing her but little
time to breathe or double. The keenest
sportsmen often find it difficult to keep up
with this dog, and with a strong hare it is
rather fatiguing work. There is a great deal
of melody and cheerful harmony in the voices
of harriers during the chase.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Beckford, who was justly esteemed
one of the best judges of dogs in Britain, endeavoured,
as far as possible, to breed his harriers
with much bone and strength within a
small compass, and, at the same time, of a
handsome make. These respective qualities
he obtained; and his hounds ran remarkably
well together, went fast, had all the alacrity
that could be desired, and would hunt the
coldest scent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the harrier is the best adapted for
hare hunting, yet there are situations where he
is too weak, being ill-suited for swampy and
marshy lands, such as those of Lancashire and
Lincolnshire, and many other places. The
large low southern hound seems best calculated
for such localities. Harriers which are of a
larger description, and crossed for the purpose
of speed, are only superior in open countries,
where, for want of covert, the hare will run
five or six miles right out without a single
turn. In such cases the pleasure of the chase
may be compared to those of fox-hunting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harriers, in Mr. Beckford’s judgment, to be
good, must be kept to their proper game.
Hounds cannot be perfect unless used to one
scent, and one style of hunting; to run fox
with them teaches them to skirt, and is of
great disservice to them. The high scent
which a fox leaves, the straightness of his
course, the eagerness of the pursuit, and the
hallooing that usually accompanies it, all contribute
to spoil a harrier.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Hawks (<i>Accipitrina</i>, <i>Vigors</i>) are birds of
prey, belonging to the falcon family (<i>Falconidæ</i>,
<span class='sc'>Leach</span>), and characterised by the wings
being short, and, when closed, scarcely reaching
to the end of the tail; the first quill feather very
short, the third nearly equal to the fourth, which
is the longest in the wing; shanks plaited, long,
and slender; middle toe greatly exceeding the
two lateral ones in length; claws much hooked,
and very sharp; flight rapid and direct. They
pounce upon their prey on the wing, and are
so bold as to attack much larger birds than
themselves.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Breaking of Hawks.</i>—When the hawk
is placed upon the fist with his hood on, he
will at first <i>bait</i>, (flutter off,) when he is to
be replaced gently by the hand; but he will
very soon learn to sit still. He must be
carried on the fist during the greater part of
the day frequently, and stroked with a feather
on his back and legs.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he is to be fed, the hood must be
taken off. At first, this is best done at night,
with a candle so placed as to give no more
light than is absolutely necessary; but in two
or three days this precaution will not be required,
and he may be unhooded, and fed by
daylight.</p>

<p class='c006'>He must now be brought, by degrees, to
stand quiet when the hood is to be put on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The brail is used for this purpose. This is
a thong of soft leather, with a slit running
longitudinally along the middle, of such a
length as to admit the pinion joint.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the pinion joint has been introduced
into the slit, the lower end of the thong is
brought backwards under the wing, and tied
to the other end above it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wing is thus confined, and in such a
way as to remove it but little from its natural
position, and so that it can receive no injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another very effectual way to make a
hawk stand quiet is, by causing water to
stream upon him, from a wisp of hay or
straw, until he is thoroughly drenched. This
should always be done in the morning, and
he should be carried on the fist until he is
dry, with his wing <i>brailed</i>, be stroked with
a feather, and hooded and unhooded very
frequently.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he has become a little accustomed
to the hood, neither the brail nor the drenching
will be necessary, but he must be carried
almost all day upon the fist. The hood is to
be occasionally taken off, and he may then be
allowed for a short time to pull upon a stump
or pinion from which he can get but little
meat.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few mouthfuls should always be given
to him the moment the hood is put on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hawks, when hooded, are always quiet.
In the field the hood prevents them from
<i>baiting</i> when birds rise, and, at other times,
from being alarmed at any thing that may
approach them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may, perhaps, appear paradoxical to assert,
that hawks, by being kept hooded, are brought
nearer to their natural habits, but this is undoubtedly
the case, for by this treatment they
are induced to remain at rest when they are
not either feeding, or in pursuit of game; and
such are their habits in a wild state, when
left undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the hawk is become tolerably tame,
he may be unhooded, and, after having eaten
a few mouthfuls, be placed on the block, and
enticed to come from thence to the fist when
held near him. He will soon learn to fly to
it when it is presented to him at the distance
of several feet, the fist being, of course,
always well garnished with meat.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he has been practised in this manner
for a few days, if he be unhooded on the
fist, and a small piece of meat be thrown on
the ground, to the distance of two or three
feet, he will fly down to it, and having eaten
it, fly back to the fist, enticed, as usual, by
the offer of food.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The sport of hawking is generally placed at
the head of those amusements that can only
be practised in the country, and probably it
obtained this precedency from its being a
pastime so generally followed by the nobility,
not in this country only, but also upon the
continent. Persons of high rank rarely appeared
without their dogs and their hawks;
the latter they carried with them when they
journeyed from one country to another, and
sometimes even when they went to battle,
and would not part with them to procure their
own liberty when taken prisoners. Sometimes
they formed part of the train of an ecclesiastic.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds were considered as ensigns of
nobility: and no action could be reckoned
more dishonourable to a man of rank than to
give up his hawk.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot trace the origin of hawking to an
earlier period than the middle of the fourth
century. Julius Firmicus, who lived about
that time, is the first Latin author that speaks
of falconers, and the art of teaching one species
of birds to fly after and catch others.</p>

<p class='c006'>The grand fauconnier of France was an officer
of great eminence; his annual salary was
four thousand florins; he was attended by fifty
gentlemen, and fifty assistant falconers; he
was allowed to keep three hundred hawks; he
licensed every vender of hawks in France,
and received a tax upon every bird sold in
that kingdom, and even within the verge of
the court; and the king never rode out upon
any occasion of consequence without this officer
attending him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Edward III., according to Froissart, had
with him in his army when he invaded France,
thirty falconers on horseback, who had charge
of his hawks; and every day he either hunted,
or went to the river for the purpose of hawking,
as his fancy inclined him.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may also here notice, that the ladies
not only accompanied the gentlemen in pursuit
of this diversion, but often practised it by
themselves; and, if we may believe a contemporary
writer, in the thirteenth century, they
even excelled the men in knowledge and exercise
of the art of falconry, which reason, he
very ungallantly produces, in proof that the
pastime was frivolous and effeminate. Hawking
was forbidden to the clergy by the canons
of the church; but the prohibition was by no
means sufficient to restrain them from the
pursuit of this favourite and fashionable
amusement. On which account, as well as
for hunting, they were severely lashed by the
poets and moralists; and, indeed, the one was
rarely spoken of without the other being included;
for those who delighted in hawking
were generally proficients in hunting also.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the hawk was not flying at her game,
she was usually hood-winked, with a cap or
hood provided for that purpose, and fitted to
her head; and this hood was worn abroad as
well as at home. All hawks taken upon
“the fist,” the term used for carrying them
upon the hand, had straps of leather, called
jesses, put upon their legs. The jesses were
made sufficiently long for the knots to appear
between the middle and the little fingers of
the hand that held them, so that the lunes,
or small thongs of leather, might be fastened
to them with two tyrrits, or rings; and the
lunes were loosely wound round the little
finger. It appears that sometimes the jesses
were of silk. Lastly, their legs were adorned
with bells, fastened with rings of leather,
each leg having one; and the leathers, to
which the bells were attached, were denominated
bewits; and to the bewits was added
the creance, or long thread, by which the bird
in tutoring, was drawn back, after she had
been permitted to fly; and this was called the
reclaiming of the hawk. The bewits, we are
informed, were useful to keep the hawk from
“winding when she bated,” that is, when she
fluttered her wings to fly after her game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Respecting the bells, it is particularly recommended
that they should not be too heavy,
to impede the flight of the bird; and that they
should be of equal weight, sonorous, shrill,
and musical; not both of one sound, but the
one a semitone below the other; they ought
not to be broken, especially in the sounding
part, because, in that case, the sound emitted
would be dull and unpleasing. “There is,
says the book of Saint Alban’s, great choice of
sparrow-hawk bells, and they are cheap enough;
but for goshawk bells, those made at Milan,
are called the best; and, indeed, they are excellent;
for they are commonly sounded with
silver, and charged for accordingly. But we
have good bells brought from Dordreght
(Dort), which are well paired, and produce a
very shrill, but pleasant sound.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The person who carried the hawk was provided
with gloves for that purpose, to prevent
their talons from hurting his hand. In the
inventories of apparel belonging to King
Henry VIII. such articles frequently occur;
at Hampton Court, in the jewel house, were
seven hawkes’ gloves embroidered.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Sebright</i>—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hay</span>, <i>s.</i> Grass dried to fodder cattle in winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much in a horse’s condition depends on the
quality of his hay; good hay is easily chosen,
and the smell and colour afford a test of its
quality not to be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hazard</span>, <i>s.</i> Chance, accident; chance of danger; a game at dice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any number of persons may play hazard.
The person who takes the box and dice, throws a
main, that is to say, a chance for the company,
which must be above four, and not exceed
nine, otherwise it is no main, consequently
he must keep throwing till he brings five, six,
seven, eight, or nine; this done, he must
throw his own chance, which may be any
above three, and not exceeding ten: if he
throw two aces or trois-ace (commonly called
crabs), he loses his stakes, let the company’s
chance, called the main, be what it will. If
the main should be seven, and seven or eleven
be thrown immediately after, it is what is
called a nick, and the caster (the present
player) wins out his stakes: also, if eight be
the main, and eight or twelve thrown immediately
after, it is also called a nick, and the
caster wins his stakes. The caster throwing
any other number for the main, such as is
admitted, and bringing the same number
directly afterwards, that is likewise termed
a nick, and he then also wins whatever stakes
he has made.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every three successive mains the caster
wins, he is to pay half a guinea to the box or
furnisher of the dice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The meaning of a stake or bet at this game
differs somewhat from the other. If a person
choose to lay a sum of money with the
thrower or caster, he must put his cash upon
the table, within a circle which is described
for that purpose; when he has done this, if
the caster agree to it, he knocks the box upon
the table at the person’s money with whom
he intends to bet, or particularly mentions at
whose money he throws, which is sufficient,
and he is obliged to answer whatever sum is
down, unless the staker calls to cover; in
that case the caster is obliged to stake also,
otherwise the bets would be void. It is optional
in the person who bets with the thrower, to bar
any throw which the caster may be going to
cast, provided neither of the dice be seen; if
one die should be discovered, the caster must
throw the other to it, unless the throw is barred
in proper time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common odds, which are absolutely
necessary to be understood, before any person
attempts to play or bet at this game, are as
follow: if seven be thrown for the main, and
four the chance, it is 2 to 1 against the person
who throws; if six to four be thrown, 5
to 3; if five to four, 4 to 3; seven to nine,
3 to 2; seven to six, 3 to 2, barring the two
trois; with the two trois, only six to five;
seven to five, 3 to 2; six to five, an even bet,
barring the doublets or the two trois; with
the trois, 5 to 4; eight to five, an even bet,
barring the two fours; five to four with the
two fours; nine to five, even; nine to four, is
4 to 3; the nick of seven is 7 to 2, but often
laid but 10 to 3; and five to one you do not
nick six or eight.</p>

<p class='c006'>To illustrate these calculations still more
clearly, the following table will be serviceable:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Hedgehogs abound in my gardens and fields.
The manner in which they eat the roots of
the plantain in my grass walk is very curious:
with their upper mandible, which is much
longer than their lower, they bore under the
plant, and so eat the root off upwards, leaving
the tuft of leaves untouched. In this respect
they are serviceable, as they destroy a very
troublesome weed; but they deface the walks
in some measure by digging little round holes.
It appears, by the dung that they drop upon
the turf, that beetles are no inconsiderable
part of their food. In June last I procured a
litter of four or five young hedgehogs, which
appeared to be about five or six days old;
they, I find, like puppies, are born blind, and
could not see when they came to my hands.
No doubt their spines are soft and flexible at
the time of their birth, or else the poor dam
would have but a bad time of it in the critical
moment of parturition: but it is plain that
they soon harden; for these little pigs had
such stiff prickles on their backs and sides as
would easily have fetched blood, had they not
been handled with caution. Their spines are
quite white at this age; and they have little
hanging ears, which I do not remember to be
discernible in the old ones. They can, in
part, at this age draw their skin down over
their faces; but are not able to contract themselves
into a ball, as they do, for the sake of
defence, when full grown. The reason, I suppose,
is, because the curious muscle that enables
the creature to roll itself up into a ball
has not then arrived at its full tone and
firmness. Hedgehogs make a deep and warm
hybernaculum with leaves and moss, in which
they conceal themselves for the winter: but I
never could find that they stored in any winter
provision, as some quadrupeds certainly do.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Jesse says, “I had also a tame hedge-hog,
which nestled before the fire, on the stomach
of an old lazy terrier dog, who was much
attached to it, and the best understanding
existed between them.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sagacity of the Hedgehog.</i>—During the
summer of 1818, as Mr. Lane, gamekeeper
to the Earl of Galloway, was passing by the
wood of Glascaden, near Garlieston, in Scotland,
he fell in with a hedgehog, crossing the
road at a small distance before him, carrying
on its back six pheasant’s eggs, which upon
examination he found it had pilfered from a
pheasant’s nest hard by. The ingenuity of
the creature was very conspicuous, as several
of the remaining eggs were holed, which must
have been done by it, when in the act of rolling
itself over the nest, in order to make as
many adhere to its prickles as possible. After
watching the motions of the urchin for a short
time longer, Mr. Lane saw it deliberately
crawl into a furze bush, where its nest was,
and where the shells of several eggs were
strewed around, which had at some former
period been conveyed thither in the same
manner.—<i>White’s Selborne</i>—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This well known species, commonly called
hedge sparrow, needs little description. The

head and neck brown, mixed with ash-colour;
back and wing coverts darker brown, edged
with rufous brown; throat and breast dull ash-colour;
belly dirty white; sides and vent tawny
brown. The female has less ash-colour
about the head and breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hedge sparrow is found in all parts of
England; has a pleasing song, which it begins
with the new year, if the weather is mild;
breeds early, making a nest in March, composed
of green moss and wool, and lined with
hair, which is placed in some low evergreen
shrub, thick brush, or cut hedge; frequently
builds in faggot piles. The eggs are four or
five in number, blue; their weight about
twenty-eight grains.</p>

tribe that remains with us the whole year.

</div>

<p class='c006'>Although the heron is of a long, lank,
awkward shape, yet its plumage gives it, on
the whole, an agreeable appearance; but when
stripped of its feathers, it looks as if it had
been starved to death. It seldom weighs more
than between three and four pounds, notwithstanding
it measures about three feet in
length, and in the breadth of its wings, from
tip to tip, above five. The bill is six inches
long, straight, pointed, and strong, and its
edges are thin and slightly serrated; the upper
mandible is of a yellowish horn colour,
darkest on the ridge, the under one
yellow; a bare skin, of a greenish colour,
is extended from the beak beyond the
eyes; the irides of which are yellow, and
give them a fierce and piercing aspect.—The
brow and crown of the head are white,
bordered above the eyes by black lines, which
reach the nape of the neck, where they join a
long flowing pendent crest of the same colour.
The upper part of the neck, in some, is white,
in others pale ash, the forepart lower down is
spotted with a double row of black feathers,
and those which fall over the breast are long,
loose, and unwebbed; the shoulders and scapular
feathers are also of the same kind of texture,
of a grey colour generally streaked with
white, and spread over its down-clothed back.
The ridge of the wing is white; coverts and
secondaries lead colour; bastard wings and
quills of a bluish black, as are also the long,
soft feathers, which take their rise on the sides
under the wings; and, falling down, meet at
their tips, and hide all the under parts: the
latter, next the skin, are covered with a thick,
matted, dirty-white down, except about the
belly and vent, which are almost bare. The
tail is short, and consists of twelve feathers of
a cinereous or brownish lead-colour; the legs
are dirty-green, long, bare above the knees, and
the middle claw is jagged on the inner edge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female has not the long flowing crest,
or the long feathers which hang over the
breast of the male, and her whole plumage is
more uniformally dull and obscure. In the
breeding-season they congregate in large societies;
and, like the rooks, build their nests
on trees, with sticks, lined with dried grass,
wool, and other warm materials. The female
lays from four to six eggs, of a pale, greenish-blue
colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The heron is described by Buffon as exhibiting
the picture of wretchedness, anxiety,
and indigence, condemned to struggle perpetually
with misery and want, and sickened by
the restless cravings of a famished appetite, &amp;c.
However faithful this ingenious naturalist may
have been in pourtraying the appearance of the
heron, yet others are not inclined to adopt his
sentiments in describing its habits and manners,
or to agree with him in opinion that it is
one of the most wretched of animated beings.
It is probable that it suffers no more than other
birds, many species of which employ equal attention
in looking for their prey, and it is not
unlikely that the heron derives pleasure from
it instead of pain. This bird, however, is of a
melancholy deportment, a silent and patient
creature; and will, in most severe weather,
stand motionless a long time in the water, fixed
to a spot, in appearance like the stump or root
of a tree, waiting for its prey, which consists of
frogs, waternewts, eels, and other kinds of fish;
and it is also said that it will devour field-mice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The heron traverses the country to a great
distance in quest of some convenient or favourite
fishing spot, and in its aerial journeys soars
to a great height, to which the eye is directed
by its harsh cry, uttered from time to time
while on the wing. In flying it draws the head
between the shoulders, and the legs stretched
out, seem, like the longer tails of some birds,
to serve the office of a rudder. The motion
of their wings is heavy and flagging, and yet
they get forward at a greater rate than would
be imagined.</p>

<p class='c006'>In England herons were formerly ranked
among the royal game, and protected as such
by the laws; and whoever destroyed their eggs
was liable to a penalty of twenty shillings for
each offence. Heron hawking was at that time
a favourite diversion among the nobility and
gentry of the kingdom, at whose tables this
bird was a favourite dish, and was as much esteemed
as pheasants and peacocks.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Great White Heron.</i> (<i>Ardea alba</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Heron blanc</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The great white
heron is of nearly the same hulk as the common
heron, but its legs are longer. It has no crest,
and its plumage is wholly white; its bill yellow,
and its legs black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its character and manner of living are the
same as those of the common heron, and it is
found in the same countries, though this species
is not nearly so numerous. It has rarely
been seen in Great Britain. Pennant, in his
Arctic Zoology, says it is found in the Russian
dominions, about the Caspian and Black Seas,
the lakes of Great Tartary, and the river Irtisch,
and sometimes as far north as latitude
53°. Latham says it is met with in New York,
in America, from June to October; at different
seasons of the year it is found in Jamaica,
and in the Brazils: and our circumnavigators
have met with it at New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Night Heron, Lesser Ash-coloured
Heron or Night Raven.</i> (<i>Ardea Nycticorax</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Bihoreau</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The
length of this bird is about twenty inches; the
bill is three inches and three quarters long,
slightly arched, strong, and black, inclining to
yellow at the base; the skin from the beak
round the eye is bare, and of a greenish colour;
irides yellow. A white line is extended
from the beak, over each eye a black patch,
glossed with green, covers the crown of the
head and nape of the neck, from which three
long narrow white feathers tipped with brown,
hang loose and waving: the hinder part of the
neck, coverts of the wing, sides and tail, are
ash-coloured; throat white, forepart of the
neck, breast, and belly, yellowish white or buff;
the back black, the legs a greenish yellow.
The female is nearly of the same size as the
male, but she differs considerably in her plumage,
which is less bright and distinct, being
more blended with clay or dirty white, brown,
grey, and rusty ash-colour, and she has not the
delicate plumes which flow from the head of
the male.</p>

<p class='c006'>The night heron frequents the sea shores,
rivers, and inland marshes, and lives upon
crickets, slugs, frogs, reptiles, and fish. It remains
concealed during the day, and does not
roam abroad until the approach of night, when
it is heard and known by its rough, harsh, and
disagreeable cry, which is by some compared
to the noise made by a person straining to
vomit. Some ornithologists affirm that the female
builds her nest on trees, others that she
builds it on rocky cliffs: probably both accounts
are right. She lays three or four white
eggs.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is not numerous, although
widely dispersed over Europe, Asia, and America.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bird is indeed very uncommon in this
country. Latham mentions one in the Leverian
Museum, which was shot, not many miles
from London, in May 1782.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Voracity of the Heron.</i>—In the month of
April 1818, as a person was walking a short
distance from the river Mole, in the neighbourhood
of Cobham Park, Surrey, where
H. C. Combe, Esq. has a heronry, he was surprised
by a pike in weight full 2lbs. dropping
from the air immediately before him: on looking
up, he perceived a large heron hovering
over him, which had no doubt dropped the fish
from its beak. And also, during the same
month, another individual near the above spot,
saw a heron take a fish from the water, and
after carrying it to a bank insert its bill into
the vent of the fish, beginning to suck its entrails;
he drove away the bird, and on taking
up the fish, found it to be a pike weighing a
pound and upwards.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Some hawks will not attack a heron, when
it is first shown to them; but they may
generally be brought to it by flying them at
a cock, of a light colour, and by tying meat
upon a heron’s back, and allowing them to
feed there. Small pieces of elder are put
upon the heron’s beak, to prevent him from
wounding the hawk in training. The herons
are caught by a slip-knot at the end of a long
string, so arranged round their nests as to be
drawn about their legs when they come upon
their eggs. This is best done about sun-set;
and the man who is to draw the string, must
place himself to leeward of the nest. Herons
will not feed when they are first taken; it is
therefore necessary to cram them with food,
and to tie a piece of mat round their necks,
to prevent them from throwing it up again.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A well-stocked heronry in an open country
is necessary for this sport. The herons go
out in the morning to rivers and ponds at a
very considerable distance, in search of food,
and return to the heronry towards the evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is at this time that the falconers place
themselves in the open country, down wind of
the heronry; so that when the herons are
intercepted on their return home, they are
obliged to fly against the wind to gain their
place of retreat. When a heron passes, <i>a cast</i>
(a couple) of hawks is let go. The heron disgorges
his food when he finds that he is pursued,
and endeavours to keep above the hawks
by rising in the air; the hawks fly in a spiral
direction to get above the heron, and thus the
three birds frequently appear to be flying in
different directions. The first hawk makes
his stoop as soon as he gets above the heron,
who evades it by a shift, and thus gives the
second hawk time to get up and to stoop in his
turn. In what is deemed a good flight, this is
frequently repeated, and the three birds often
mount to a great height in the air. When
one of the hawks seizes his prey, the other
soon <i>binds to him</i>, as it is termed, and buoyant
from the motion of their wings, the three
descend together to the ground with but little
velocity. The falconer must lose no time in
getting hold of the heron’s neck when he is on
the ground, to prevent him from injuring the
hawks. It is then, and not when he is in the
air, that he will use his beak in his defence.
Hawks have, indeed, sometimes, but very
rarely, been hurt by striking against the heron’s
beak when stooping, but this has been purely
by accident, and not (as has been said) by the
heron’s presenting his beak to his pursuer as a
means of defence.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the heron flies down wind, he is
seldom taken, the hawks are in great danger
of being lost, and as the flight is in a straight
line, it affords but little sport.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Pennant</i>—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Heronry</span>, or <span class='sc'>Heronshaw</span>, <i>s.</i> A place where herons breed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Belon mentions it as one of the extraordinary
feats performed by the divine king Francis
I., that he formed two artificial heronries
at Fontainebleau,—“the very elements themselves,”
he adds, “obeying the commands of
this divine king (whom God absolve!!!), for to
force nature is a work partaking of divinity.”
In order to enhance the merits of these French
heronries, he undertakes to assert, that they
were unknown to the ancients, because they
are not mentioned in any of their writings;
and for the same reason he concludes that there
are none in Britain. Before Belon’s time,
on the contrary, and before the “Divine” constructor
of heronries in France was born, there
were express laws enacted in England for the
protection of herons, it being a fine of ten shillings
to take the young out of the nest, and
six shillings and eight-pence for a person, without
his own grounds, killing a heron, except
by hawking, or by the long-bow; while in subsequent
enactments, the latter penalty was increased
to twenty shillings, or three months’
imprisonment. At present, however, in consequence
of the discontinuance of hawking,
little attention is paid to the protection of heronries,
though, I believe, none of the old statutes
respecting them have been repealed.
Not to know a hawk from a heron-shaw (the
former name for a heron) was an old adage,
which arose when the diversion of heron-hawking
was in high fashion: it has since been
corrupted into the absurd vulgar proverb, “not
to know a hawk from a hand-saw.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the breeding season they congregate, and
make their nests very near each other. Mr.
Pennant mentions having seen eighty nests on
one tree. We once saw a heronry on a small
island in a lake in the north of Scotland,
whereon there was only one scrubby oak tree,
which not being sufficient to contain all the
nests many were placed on the ground.—<i>Sebright</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Herring</span>, <i>s.</i> A small sea-fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all migrating fish, the herring and the
pilchard take the most adventurous voyages.</p>

<p class='c006'>This mighty army begins to put itself in
motion from the Icy Sea early in the spring:
this body is distinguished by that name, for
the word herring is derived from the German
heer, an army, to express their number, which
is so vast, that were all the men in the world
loaded with herrings, they could not carry
the thousandth part away. No sooner, however,
is their asylum quitted, but millions of
enemies collect to thin their squadrons. The
fin fish and cacholot swallow barrels at a
yawn; the porpoise, the grampus, the shark,
and the whole numerous tribe of dog-fish, desist
from making war upon each other, and
make the herring their easy prey. The unnumbered
flocks of sea fowl, that chiefly inhabit
near the pole, watch the outset of their
migration and spread extensive ruin. In this
exigence the defenceless emigrants find no
other safety but by crowding closer together,
and leaving to the outermost the danger of
being first devoured. Thus, like frighted
sheep (which ever run together in a body),
each finding some protection in being but one
of many that are equally liable to invasion,
they separate into shoals: those to the west
visit the American shores, while those holding
to the east pour down towards Europe, endeavouring
to evade their merciless pursuers
by approaching the first shore that presents
itself, which is that of Iceland, in the beginning
of March. Upon their arrival on that
coast, this phalanx, notwithstanding its diminutions,
is still of amazing extent, depth, and
closeness, covering an extent of shore as large
as the island itself; the whole water seems
alive, and by their foes the herrings are cooped
up so closely, that any hollow vessel put into
it takes them out of the water without further
trouble. The power of increasing in these
animals exceeds our idea, as it would in a very
short time outstrip all calculation. A single
herring, it is affirmed, if suffered to multiply
unmolested and undiminished for twenty years,
would show a progeny greater in bulk than ten
such globes as that we live upon; but happily
the balance of nature is exactly preserved,
and their consumption is equal to their fecundity.
Upon this account, we must consider the
fish and fowl that so incessantly attack them,
not as plunderers, but as the benefactors of
mankind: without their aid the sea would
soon be overcharged with the burden of its
own productions, and that element, which at
present distributes health and plenty to the
shore, would but load it with putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>These collective masses that come upon our
coasts, begin to appear off the Shetland Isles
in April and May; these are only the fore-runners
of the grand shoal which comes in
June, and their arrival is marked by the numbers
of birds, such as gannets and others, which
follow them as their prey. But when the
main body approaches, its breadth and depth
alters the very appearance of the ocean. They
divide into distinct columns of five or six
miles long, and three or four broad, while the
water before them ripples as if forced out of
its bed; sometimes they sink for ten or fifteen
minutes, then rise again to the surface, on
which in bright weather they reflect a variety
of splendid colours, like a field bespangled
with the most precious gems, in which, or
rather in a much more valuable light, should
this stupendous gift of Providence be considered
by the inhabitants of the British Isles.
The fishermen are ready prepared for their
reception, and by nets made for the occasion
they sometimes take above two thousand barrels
at a single draught.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this check from the Shetland Isles,
which divide the army into two parts, one
wing takes to the eastern shores of Great Britain,
and fills every bay and creek with its
numbers; the other pushes on towards Yarmouth,
the great and ancient mart of herrings;
they then pass through the British Channel,
and after that in a manner disappear. Those
which take to the west, after offering themselves
to the Hebrides, where the great stationary
fishery is, proceed towards the north
of Ireland, where being interrupted they make
a second division; that to the western side is
scarcely perceived, being soon lost in the immensity
of the Atlantic, whilst the other,
which passes into the Irish Sea, rejoices and
feeds the inhabitants of most of the coasts
that border upon it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The herring is always found in shoals, and
on some occasions are crowded so close together,
as to fill the sea, at least so far as our
implements can reach, from top to bottom.
Ships are said to have been retarded in their
course in passing through these shoals, and
instances are recorded where these little fishes
have been left by the ebbing of the tide in
heaps three feet deep upon the shores for
many miles in extent. It is universally credited
among those conversant in the herring
fishery, that no other fish will go into the
middle of a shoal. The whale, to whom they
are a favourite repast, and who swallows a
thousand at once, never ventures into the
shoal, but hovers about the skirts of it, and
regularly follows their course. The dog-fish,
which in vast troops assiduously attend the
herrings wherever they go, carefully keep
aloof from the great mass of them; so it is
with other fishes, who delight in the herring
as a prey, but as a body seem to dread their
multitudes.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Herring Fishing.</i>—To approach the fleet
was a task of some difficulty. The nets, extended
in interminable lines, were so frequent,
that much skill was necessary to penetrate
this hempen labyrinth, without fouling
the back ropes. Warning cries directed our
course, and with some delay we treaded the
crowded surface, and, guided by buoys and
puckawns, found ourselves in the very centre
of the flotilla.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was an interesting scene; momently the
boats glided along the back ropes, which were
supported at short intervals by corks, and at
greater by inflated dog-skins, and raising the
curtain network, which these suspended, the
herrings were removed from the meshes, and
deposited in the boats. Some of the nets
were particularly fortunate, obliging their
proprietors to frequently relieve them of the
fish; while others, though apparently stretched
within a few yards, and consequently in the
immediate run of the herrings, were favoured
with but a few stragglers; and the indolent
fisherman had to occupy himself with a sorrowful
ditty, or in moody silence watched the
dark sea “like a strange soul upon the Stygian
banks staying for waftage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The darkness of the night increased the
scaly brilliancy which the phosphoric properties
of these beautiful fish produce. The bottom
of the boat, now covered with some
thousand herrings, glowed with a living light,
which the imagination could not create, and
the pencil never imitate. The shades of gold
and silvery gems were rich beyond description:
and much as I had heard of phosphoric
splendour before, every idea I had formed fell
infinitely short of its reality.—<i>Buffon</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c006'>Whether these immatured birds breed we
cannot be certain, but are inclined to think they
do, as we saw a great many of them intermixed
with the perfect ones in the gullery on
an island off St. David’s, where the nests were
innumerable: they seemed equally clamorous
with the others when disturbed. The nests
were on the top of the island, amongst the grass
and loose stones, composed of a small quantity
of long dry grass, the eggs, which were
two in number, of a dark olive-brown, with
dusky blotches. Like others of the genus,
this bird feeds indiscriminately on fish, and
various other productions of the sea, particularly
the star-fish. It is sometimes observed
to trample the soft sand, by moving its feet alternately
in the same place: for what purpose
this singular action is intended, we cannot say,
unless it is to force up the sand eels or other
hidden prey, as the one mentioned above did
the worms.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Hobby.</i> (<i>Falco subbuteo</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;

feet. The bill is blue; cere and orbits of the

of the head and back are of a bluish black;

the breast and belly are pale, marked with
dusky streaks; the thighs rusty, with long
dusky streaks; the wings brown; the two
middle feathers of the tail are of a deep dove
colour, the others are barred with rusty and
tipped with white. The female is much larger,
and the spots on her breast more conspicuous
than those of the male; the legs and feet are
yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hobby breeds with us, but is said to
emigrate in October. It was formerly used
in falconry, chiefly for larks and other small
birds, which were caught in a singular manner:
when the hawk was cast off, the larks,
fixed to the ground through fear, became an
easy prey to the fowler, who drew a net over
them. Buffon says that it was used in taking
partridges and quails.</p>

<p class='c006'>A male hobby perceiving a goldfinch in a
cage, within a window which happened to be
open, dashed at the imprisoned bird, notwithstanding
several persons were in the room;
but being alarmed at the natural vociferations
of some young ladies for the safety of their
darling, the intruder mistook the passage by
which he entered, and flew against the glass,
when his retreat was cut off, and he was secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species was formerly trained for hawking,
but more commonly used for taking partridges

daring, that is, the hobby was cast off, which

press it well, and throw it into clean water;
press it, and throw off the water, pour in
more, and do the same at least three times.
You must open your fur before you can dye

<p class='c006'>In the choice of hooks, those should be
preferred that are longish in the shanks,
strong, and rather deep in the bend, the point
fine and straight, and as true as it can be set
to the level of the shank (which, for fly making,
should be tapered off to the end, that the
fly may be the neater finished), the point
should be sharp and the barb of a proper
length; many experienced anglers, who have
impartially tried both kinds, consider these to
be more sure than the crooked hooks, that
they cause a smaller orifice, and are less liable
to break their hold. At Limerick, in Ireland,
the best of these hooks are manufactured. A
hook, whose point stands outwards, ought never
to be chosen, as it frequently scratches the
fish without laying hold; if the points were
somewhat shorter, and the barbs a trifle wider,
the hooks of every maker would be improved.
When hooks are blunt, a small whetstone will
restore their sharpness much better than a file,
which always leaves them rough and jagged.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I find, by sad experience, that in hook-making
the Irish are far before us; our workmen
either do not understand the method of forming
and tempering hooks, or they do not take
sufficient pains in their manufacture. It is
strange, that when so much of the angler’s
pleasure and success depends upon the quality
of his hooks, that more attention is not bestowed
upon their fabrication. The art of
forming, and the process of tempering them,
appears simple enough; and that little difficulty
is required to attain it, is evident from
the fact that many fishermen make their own
hooks. For my own part, however, I consider
hook-making to be an unnecessary accomplishment
for the angler, as the best hooks in
the world can be procured without trouble, and
at a trifling expense, from O’Shaughnessy of
Limerick.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I have even made a hook, which, though a
little inferior in form, in other respects, I think
I could boast as equal to the Limerick ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>I never used any hooks for salmon-fishing
except those which I am sure have been made
by O’Shaughnessy of Limerick; for even
those made in Dublin, though they seldom
break, yet they now and then bend; and the
English hooks, made of cast-steel, in imitation
of Irish ones, are the worst of all.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Hooks, to whip on.</i>—When hooks are
armed, especially to hair, it should be done
with small but strong silk, well rubbed with
shoemaker’s wax, after having smoothed the
shank with a whetstone, to hinder its fretting;
from a straw’s breadth below the top of the
hook, wrap the silk about the bare shank until
it comes to the top, which will prevent its
slipping, or cutting the line from frequently
using; then lay the hair or gut on the inside
and whip the silk downwards almost to the
bend of the hook; the colour of the arming
silk should be as near that of the baits used as
may be, and its size be regulated by the thickness
of the wire, hair, or gut, to which it is
joined. In whipping on a hook, it is to be

<p class='c006'>The generic character of horses, according
to Linnaeus, is, that the fore-teeth are twelve
in number, the upper six erect and parallel,
the lower six more prominent; the tusks are
solitary, included, remote; teats two, inguinal:
they fight by biting, and kicking with
the hind feet; and they have the singular
property of breathing only through the nostrils,
and not through the mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cuvier places the horse in the class Mammalia,
which contains those animals that suckle
their young, and forms the ninth genus of his
sixth order, called Pachydermata, of which
order the following are characters:—Skin very
thick; some of the genera are partially without
teeth, others with three sorts of teeth;
quadrupedal, generally with hoofs, and the
toes varying in number; stomach simple, and
they do not ruminate; without clavicles, or
collar-bones. They are either herbivorous or
omnivorous, and their habits are various. They
generally inhabit the temperate and torrid zone.</p>

<p class='c006'>The genus Equus is subdivided by Cuvier
into six species, and thus defined:—Incisory
teeth, six in the upper jaw, and six in the under;
two canines, one above and one below, on
each side of the cutting or incisory teeth, (the
females of some of the species with no canine
teeth,) and six cheek teeth, or grinders, on
each side, on both jaws; they are furrowed on
both sides with flat crowns and several ridges
of enamel. Between the canines and cheek
teeth is a void space; the upper lip is susceptible
of considerable motion; the eyes are
large; the pupil oblong-ovate, placed laterally;
their sight excellent, and, although not
formed for seeing in the night, they can distinguish
objects very clearly in the dark;
ears rather small, pointed, and erect, having
great mobility in the external conch, so that
their hearing is very acute, and is the sense
which, in all probability, they possess in the
greatest perfection; feet, with a single apparent
toe, covered with a thick hoof; the tail
is furnished with long hair, or with a tuft at
the extremity; mammæ two, inguinal; the
stomach is simple and membranaceous, and
the intestines and cæcum very large.</p>

<p class='c006'>The six species of this genus are the horse,
ass, common zebra, zebra of the plains, quagga,
dzhiggtai, with the mule, which may be
regarded as a sub-species.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all quadrupeds, the horse possesses,
along with grandeur of stature, the greatest
elegance and proportion of parts. By comparing
him with the animals above or below
him, we find that the ass is ill made, and that
the head of the lion is too large; that the
limbs of the ox are too slender, and too short
in proportion to the size of his body; that the
camel is deformed; and the grosser animals,
as the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and elephant,
may be considered as rude and shapeless
masses. The great difference between
the head of man and that of the quadruped,
consists in the length of his jaws, which is
the most ignoble of all characters. But,
although the jaws of the horse be very long,
he has not, like the ass, an air of imbecility,
nor, like the ox, of stupidity. The regularity
and proportion of the parts of his head, give
him a light and sprightly aspect, being gracefully
attached to his finely arched neck,
which is well supported by the beauty of his
chest. He elevates his head, as if anxious to
exalt himself above the condition of other
quadrupeds. In this noble attitude he regards
man, face to face. His eyes are open, lively,
and intelligent; his ears handsome, and of a
proper height, being neither too long, like
those of the ass, nor too short, like those of
the bull. His mane adorns his graceful neck,
and gives him the appearance of strength and
courage. His long bushy tail covers, and
terminates with advantage, the extremity of
his body. His tail, very different from the
short tails of the deer, elephant, and hippopotamus,
and from the naked tails of the ass,
camel, and rhinoceros, is formed of long, thick
hairs, which seem to rise from his crupper,
because the trunk from which they proceed
is very short. He cannot, like the lion,
elevate his tail; but, though pendulous, it
becomes him better; and as he can move it
from side to side, it serves him to drive off
the flies, which incommode him; for though
his skin is very firm, and well garnished with
close hair, it is, nevertheless, very sensible.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Brown says, the head of the horse should
not be too long, and it ought to be rather thin
than otherwise. The front should be narrow,
and a little convex; the eye-pits well filled,
and the eye-lids thin; the eyes large and
prominent, clear, lively, and sparkling with
fiery glances; the pupil should be large; the
under jaw should be a little thick, but not
fleshy; the nose slightly arched; the nostrils
open and deep, and divided by a thin septum
or partition; the ears should be small, erect,
and narrow, but not too stiff, and placed on
the upper part of the head, at a proper distance
from each other, but not too wide, as
this always gives a horse a disagreeable aspect;
the mouth should be delicate, and moderately
split; the withers sharp and elevated; the
shoulders flat and not confined; the back
equal, a little arched lengthwise, and raised
on each side of the spine, which should have
the appearance of being slightly sunk; the
flanks short and full; the crupper round and
plump; the haunches well furnished with
muscular flesh; the dock, or fleshy part of
the tail, firm and thick; the thighs large and
muscular; the hough round before, broad on
the sides, and tendinous behind; the shank
thin before, and broad on the sides; the tendon
Achillis prominent, strong, and well detached
from the leg-bone; and the fetlock somewhat
prominent, and furnished with a small tuft of
long hair behind; the pasterns should be of a
middling length, and pretty large; the coronet
a little elevated; the hoof black, solid, and
shining; the instep high; the quarters round;
the heels broad, and a little prominent; the
frog thin and small, and the sole thick and
concave.—<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Arabian</span>—<span class='sc'>Hunter</span>—<span class='sc'>Roadster</span>,

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The horse is considered to have been originally
a native of what is called the old world,
and by the industry of man to have been
planted in the new. It appears from the sacred
records, that his subjugation did not take
place until many years after that of the camel
and the ass.</p>

<p class='c006'>At what precise time foreign horses were
brought into Britain is uncertain; but it is not
improbable that it was a very early one, since
history informs us they were sufficiently numerous,
and their uses well known, when
Julius Cæsar invaded the island. Whether
these early horses were the entire produce of
Britain, or whether they had already been
mixed, it is likely that their intercourse with
the Roman cavalry would introduce new
races, as diversified as the countries from
whence the Romans themselves drew their
own immense supplies. Freed from their
conquerors, the English cultivated the arts of
peace, and were consequently not unmindful
of the horse, which was become, as early as
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 930, so valuable that Athelstan prohibited
their exportation.</p>

<p class='c006'>William the Conqueror brought with him the
means of greatly improving the island horse;
and the barons who accompanied him, being
spread over the kingdom, in their newly acquired
estates, rapidly diffused a valuable
mixture among the native breeds. One of
these nobles (Roger de Belesme, Earl of
Shrewsbury) is particularly celebrated for introducing
Spanish stallions into his Welsh
possessions.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1121, the first Arabian horse on record
was imported into England, and the crusades,
which soon succeeded, were the means of introducing
a large accession of eastern horses
from the Levant. The traffic in horses now
began to assume much of its future character:
Smithfield was established as a horse-market;
and the dealing in this animal was already
become a regular profession, as well as already
garnished with much of its trickery.</p>

<p class='c006'>To Edward the Second the breed of English
horses owes much of its early improvement:
he procured cavalry horses from Lombardy,
Italy, and Spain, and heavy draught horses
from Flanders. From this time the public
attention appears to have been particularly
directed to the necessity of improving the
breed of horses; and many public ordinances
were promulgated to that effect. In the
reigns of Henry VII. and VIII. it became
common to import foreign stallions for this
purpose from Barbary and Spain; and, in the
two following reigns, others were imported
from Belgium, Flanders, and Denmark; and
as the former were intended to improve the
speed, spirit, and beauty, these latter added
greatly to the size of the future breeds. As
early as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
there were horse-races in England; but these
appear to have been principally confined to
trials of speed and continuance over uncertain
grounds between native horses. In the reign
of Henry VIII., horses either procured from
Barbary, or bred from such, were expressly
used for this purpose; and we may date the
systematic improvement in the breed, by the
admixture of what we call <i>blood</i>, to have its
origin about this time.</p>

<p class='c006'>James the First pursued the system, and
imported from Barbary a set of the finest
mares, for purity of breed and excellence of
form, which could be procured: these, known
significantly as the <i>Royal Mares</i>, greatly
assisted the general purpose. James also imported
an Arabian, whose own qualities, as
well as those of his produce, not answering to
the expectations raised, the breed for many
years became in disrepute. Regular race-courses
were now established, and racing was
conducted on fixed principles, and confined
within rules. Charles the First encouraged
these sports, and to him we owe the establishment
of the Newmarket course; and in such
estimation were they, as connected with the
national good, that even the fanaticism of
Cromwell gave way to it, for he also had his
stud of race-horses. The Restoration gave a
new impulse to racing, and a new impetus to
the improvements meditated. The Arabian
was again resorted to, and, on the renewed
trials, his proceeds justified the former expectations.
From that time to the present,
by a judicious mixture of <i>crossings</i> of the
native and the eastern horses, in different degrees
of consanguinity, according to the different
purposes for which they are required,
we now stand unrivalled among nations; and
we now send our breeds back to eastern
countries, to meliorate that <i>blood</i> which we
originally borrowed from them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The old English hound or Talbot.</i> (<i>Canis
Sagax</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—This is undoubtedly the
origin of those famous hounds for which Great
Britain is celebrated above all other countries.
In former times this dog was of a pure white,
but is now generally of a white and black colour,
and tanned over the eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>This majestic animal is distinguished by
his great size and strength; his body is long,
his chest deep, and his ears long and sweeping,
with great gravity of expression. From the
particular formation of his organs, or from the
extraordinary moisture which always flows
from his nose, or from some other unknown
cause, he is endowed with the most exquisite
sense of smelling, and can discover scent hours
after other dogs have given up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the talbot hunts with great certainty,
yet he becomes tedious from the slowness
of his motions; this, however, enables
him to receive more distinctly the directions
of the huntsman. And he can trace with a
cold scent, which he is too apt to make so by
his want of speed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The talbot, in the “History of Manchester,”
is stated to be the original breed of this island,
used by the ancient Britons in the chase of
larger kinds of game, with which the country
at one time abounded. They were common
in all parts of the kingdom, and were much
larger than they are at present; and have
been gradually declining in consequence of
mixing them with lighter dogs for the purpose
of increasing their speed. We have no doubt
that, from this cause, the breed will eventually
become extinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said, that the tone of his voice is peculiarly
deep, sonorous, powerful, and mellow.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Among sportsmen it is generally understood
that hounds of the middle size are the most
proper, all animals of that description being
stronger than such as are either very small
or very large. The shape ought to be particularly
attended to; for, if the hound be not
well proportioned, he can neither run fast
nor do much work. His legs ought to be
straight, his feet round and not very large, his
shoulders back, his breast rather wide than
narrow, his chest deep, his back broad, his
head small, his neck thin, his tail thick and
bushy and well carried. None of those young
hounds which are out at the elbows, or such
as are weak from the knee to the foot, should
ever be taken into the pack. That the pack
may look well, the hounds should be as much
as possible of a size; and if they be also handsome,
the pack will then be perfect. This,
however, contributes nothing to the goodness
of a pack, for very unhandsome packs, consisting
of hounds entirely different in size and colour,
often afford very good sport.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is only necessary that they should run
well together; to which indeed a uniformity
in size and shape seems to contribute. The
pack that can run ten miles, or any other considerable
space, in the shortest time, may be
said to go fastest, though the hounds taken separately
might be considerably inferior to
others in point of swiftness. A pack of hounds
considered in a collective body, go fast in proportion
to the excellence of their noses and
the head they carry. Packs composed of
hounds of various kinds seldom run well.
When the packs are very large, the hounds
are seldom sufficiently hunted to be good;
twenty or thirty couple, therefore, or at most
forty, will be sufficient for the keenest sportsman
in this country, as thus he may be enabled
to hunt three and even four times a week.
The number of hounds to be kept must however,
in a considerable degree, depend on the
strength of the pack, and the country in which
they hunt. They should be left at home as
seldom as possible; and too many old hounds
should not be kept. None ought to be kept
above five or six seasons, though this also is
somewhat uncertain, as we have no rule for
judging how long a hound will last. In breeding
hounds, considerable attention ought to
be paid to the dog from which you breed. All
such are to be rejected as have a tender nose,
or are babblers or skirters. An old dog should
never be put to an old bitch. January, February,
and March, are the best months for
breeding; late puppies seldom thrive. After
the females begin to grow big with young,
it will not be proper to let them hunt any
more, or indeed to remain for a much longer
time in the kennel. Sometimes these animals
will have an extraordinary number of
whelps. Mr. Beckford informs us, that he
has known a bitch have fifteen puppies at a
litter; and he assures us, that a friend of his
informed him, that a hound in his pack brought
forth sixteen, all alive. In these cases it is
proper to put some of the puppies to another
bitch, if you want to keep them all; but, if
any are destroyed, the best coloured ought to be
kept. The bitches should not only have plenty
of flesh, but milk also; and the puppies
should not be taken from them till they are
able to take care of themselves; their mothers
will be relieved when they learn to lap milk,
which they will do in a short time. After
the puppies are taken away from their mother,
the litter should have three purging balls
given them, one every other morning, and
plenty of whey the intermediate day. If a
bitch bring only one or two puppies, and you
have another that will take them, by putting
the puppies to her, the former will soon be fit
to hunt again. She should, however, be first
physicked, and it will also be of service to
anoint her dugs with brandy and water.
Whelps are liable to the distemper, to which
dogs in general are subject, and which frequently
makes great havoc among them at
their walks. Young hounds should be fed
twice a day, as they seldom take kindly to the
kennel-meat at first, and the distemper is
most apt to seize them at this time. It is impossible
to determine how many young hounds
ought to be bred in order to keep up the
pack, as this depends entirely on contingencies.
The deficiencies of one year must be
supplied by the next; but it is probable, that
from thirty to thirty-five couple of old hounds,
and from eight to thirty-five couple of young
ones will answer the purpose, where no more
than forty couple are to be kept. A considerable
number, however, ought always to be
bred; for it is undoubtedly and evidently true,
that those who breed the greatest number of
hounds must expect the best pack. After
the hounds have become acquainted with the
huntsman, and answer to their names, they
ought to be coupled, and walked out among
sheep; and two dogs should not be coupled
together, when you can avoid it. As young
hounds are awkward at first, a few ought only
to be sent out at a time, with people on foot,
and they will soon afterwards follow a horse.
With regard to the first entering of hounds
to a scent, our author gives the following directions:—“You
had better enter them at
their own game; it will save you much trouble
afterwards. Many dogs, I believe, like
that scent best which they were first blooded
to: but, be this as it may, it is most certainly
reasonable to use them to that which it is
intended they should hunt. Hounds ought
to be entered as soon as possible, though the
time must depend on the nature of the country
in which they are. In corn countries hunting
may not be practicable till the corn is cut
down; but you may begin sooner in grass
countries, and at any time in woodlands.
Hounds at their first entrance cannot be encouraged
too much. When they are become
handy, love a scent, and begin to know what
is right, it will then be soon enough to chastise
them for what is wrong; in which case
one severe beating will save a great deal of
trouble. When a hound is flogged, the whipper
in should make use of his voice as well
as his whip. They should be low in flesh
when you begin to hunt, the ground being
generally hard at that time, so that they are
very liable to be shaken. Sometimes the
huntsman turns down a cat before them,
which they kill; and, when the time of hunting
approaches, he turns out young foxes or
badgers; taking out some of the most steady
of his old hounds to lead on the young ones.
Small covers and furze brakes are drawn with
them to use them to a halloo, and to teach
them obedience. If they find improper game,
and hunt it, they are stopped and brought
back; and as long as they will stop at a rate,
they are not chastised. To render fox-hunting
complete, no young hounds should be
taken into the pack the first season; a requisite
too expensive for most sportsmen. The
pack should consist of about forty couple of
hounds, that have hunted one, two, three, four,
or five seasons. The young pack should consist
of about twenty couple of young hounds,
and an equal number of old ones. They
should have a separate establishment, and the
two kennels should not be too near one another.
When the season is over, the best of
the young hounds should be taken into the
pack, and the draft of old ones exchanged for
them. Many must be bred to enable a
sportsman to take in twenty couple of young
hounds every season. It will always be easy
to keep up the number of old hounds, for,
when your own draft is not sufficient, drafts
from other packs may be obtained, and at a
small expense. When young hounds are
hunted together for the first season, and have
not a sufficient number of old ones along with
them, it does more harm than good.”—<i>Vide</i>

<p class='c006'>The hucho is the most predatory fish of the
salmo genus, and is made like an ill-fed trout,
but longer and thicker. He has larger teeth,
more spines in the pectoral fin, a thicker skin,
a silvery belly, and dark spots only on the
back and sides. I have never seen any on
the fins. The ratio of his length to the girth
is as eight to eighteen, or, in well-fed fish, as
nine to twenty; and a fish, eighteen inches
long by eight in girth, weighed 16,215 grains.
Another, two feet long, eleven inches in girth,
and three inches thick, weighed 4lbs. 2¼ oz.
Another, twenty-six inches long, weighed 5lbs.
5oz. Of the spines in the fins, the anal has
nine, the caudal twenty, the ventral nine, the
dorsal twelve, the pectoral seventeen: having
numbered the spines in many, I give this as
correct. The fleshy fin belonging to the genus
is, I think, larger in this species than in any
I have seen. Bloch, in his work on fishes,
states, that there are black spots on all the
fins, with the exception of the anal, as a character
of this fish: and professor Wagner informs
me, he has seen huchoes with this peculiarity;
but, as I said before, I never saw any
fish with spotted fins; yet, I have examined
those of the Danube, Save, Drave, Mur, and
Izar: perhaps, this is peculiar to some stream
in Bavaria; yet the huchoes in the collection
at Munich have it not. The hucho is found
in most rivers tributary to the Danube—in
the Save and Laybach rivers always; yet the
general opinion is, that they run from the
Danube twice a year, in spring and autumn.
I can answer for their migration in spring,
having caught several in April, in streams
connected with the Save and Laybach rivers,
which had evidently come from the still dead
water into the clear running streams, for they
had the winter leech, or louse, of the trout
upon them; and I have seen them of all sizes
in April in the market at Laybach, from six
inches to two feet long; but they are found
much larger, and reach thirty, or even forty
pounds. It is the opinion of some naturalists
that it is only a fresh-water fish; yet this I
doubt, because it is never found beyond certain
falls—as in the Traun, the Drave, and
the Save; and, there can be no doubt, comes
into these rivers from the Danube; and probably
in its largest state, is a fish of the Black
Sea. Yet it can winter in fresh water; and
does not seem, like the salmon, obliged to
haunt the sea, but falls back into the warmer
waters of the great rivers; from which it
migrates in spring, to seek a cooler temperature,
and to breed. The fishermen at Gratz
say they spawn in the Mur, between March
and May. In those I have caught at Laybach,
which, however, were small ones, the ova
were not sufficiently developed to admit of
their spawning that spring. Marsigli says
that they spawn in the Danube in June. You
have seen how violently they pursue their
prey; I have never taken one without fish in
his stomach; yet, when small, they will take
a fly. In the Kleingraben, which is a feeder
to the Laybach river, and where they are
found of all sizes—from twenty pounds downwards—the
little ones take a fly, but the
large ones are too ravenous to care about so
insignificant a morsel, and prey like the largest
trout, often hunting in company, and chasing
the small fish into the narrow and shallow
streams, and then devouring them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hucho, as you have seen, preys with
great violence, and pursues his object as a foxhound
or a greyhound does. I have seen
him in repose; they lie like pikes, perfectly
still, and I have watched one for many
minutes, that never moved at all. In this
respect their habits resemble those of most
carnivorous and predatory animals. It is probably
in consequence of these habits, that they
are so much infested by lice, or leeches, which
I have seen so numerous in spring as almost
to fill their gills, and interfere with their respiration,
in which case they seek the most
rapid and turbulent streams to free themselves
from these enemies. They are very shy, and,
after being hooked, avoid the baited line.
I once saw the hucho, for which I was fishing,
follow the small fish, and then the lead of
the tackle; it seemed as if this had fixed his
attention, and he never offered at the bait
afterwards. I think a hucho that has been
pricked by the hook becomes particularly
cautious, and possesses, in this respect, the
same character as the salmon. In summer,
when they are found in the roughest and most
violent currents, their fins (particularly the
caudal fin) often appear worn and broken; at
this season they are usually in constant motion
against the stream, and are stopped by no cataract
or dam, unless it be many feet in height,
and quite inaccessible. In the middle of September,
I have caught huchoes perfectly clean
in rapid cool streams, tributary to the Laybach
and the Save rivers; and, from the small development
of their generative system at this
time, I have no doubt that they spawn in
spring. On the 13th of September, 1828, I
caught, by spinning the small dead fish, three
huchoes that had not a single leech upon their
bodies, and they were the first fish of the kind
I ever saw free from these parasites.</p>

<p class='c006'>They migrate generally when the water is
foul, and, except in the spring and autumn,
do not so readily run at the bait. I was once
nearly a month seeking for one in rivers in
which they are found, between the end of
June and that of July, without being able to
succeed in even seeing one alive; and, as far
as my information goes, the two places where
there is most probability of taking them, are
at Laybach and Ratisbon, in the tributary
streams to the Save, and in the Danube; and
the best time, in the first of these situations, is
in March and April, and, in the second, in
May. I am told, likewise, that the Izar,
which runs by Munich, is a stream where
they may be caught, when the water is clear:
and I have seen in the fish market at Munich
very large huchoes.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I am inclined to believe that the hucho is
to be found in some of the mountain loughs
in Connaught. Certainly I have seen fish
of the salmo genus, taken in rivers communicating
with deep lakes in the hills, which
strikingly resemble the fish described by Sir
Humphry.—<i>Salmonia</i>—<i>Editor.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Hunting among the Britons is of great antiquity.
Dio Nicæus, speaking of the inhabitants
of the northern parts of this island, tells
us, they were a fierce and barbarous people,
who tilled no ground, but lived upon the depredations
they committed in the southern districts,
or upon the food they procured by hunting.
Strabo also says, that the dogs bred in
Britain were highly esteemed upon the continent,
on account of their excellent qualities
or hunting; and these qualities, he seems to
hint, were natural to them, and not the effect
of tutorage by their foreign masters.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the expulsion of the Danes, and during
the short restoration of the Saxon monarchy,
the sports of the field still maintained
their ground. Edward the Confessor, whose
disposition seems rather to have been suited
to the cloister than to the throne, would join
in no other secular amusements; but he took
the greatest delight, says William of Malmsbury,
“to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit
of game, and to cheer them with his voice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>During the tyrannical government of William
the Norman, and his two sons who succeeded
him, the restrictions concerning the
killing of game were increased. The privilege
of hunting in the royal forests was confined
to the king and his favourites; and, to
render these receptacles for the beasts of the
chase more capacious, or to make new ones,
whole villages were depopulated, and places
of divine worship overthrown.</p>

<p class='c006'>King John was particularly attached to the
sports of the field; and his partiality for fine
horses, hounds, and hawks, is evident, from
his frequently receiving such animals, by way
of payment, instead of money, for the renewal
of grants, fines, and forfeitures, belonging to
the crown.</p>

<p class='c006'>Edward III. took so much delight in hunting,
that even at the time he was engaged in
war with France, and resident in that country,
he had with him in his army sixty couple of
stag hounds, and as many hare hounds, and
every day he amused himself with hunting or
hawking.</p>

<p class='c006'>James I. preferred the amusement of hunting
to hawking or shooting. It is said of this
monarch, that he divided his time betwixt his
standish, his bottle, and his hunting; the last
had his fair weather, the two former his dull
and cloudy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be a needless task, to quote the
passages in the poetical and prose writings of
the last three centuries, which prove that this
favourite pastime has lost nothing of its relish
in modern times, but, on the contrary, seems
to be more generally practised.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If you have the whole country to yourself,
and can hunt on either side of your house, as
you please, never (when you can help it) fix
your place of hunting till you see what the
weather is.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before a huntsman goes into the kennel to
draft his hounds, let him determine within
himself the number of hounds he intends to
take out; as likewise the number of young
hounds that he can venture in the country
where he is going to hunt. Different countries
may require different hounds: some may
require more hounds than others. It is not
an easy matter to draft hounds properly; nor
can any expedition be made in it without some
method.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the place of meeting and time are
fixed, every huntsman ought to be as exact to
them as it is possible for him to be. On no
account is he to be before the time; yet, on
some occasions, it might be better, perhaps, for
the diversion, were he permitted to be after it.
The course your huntsman intends to take in
drawing ought always to be well understood
before he leaves the kennel.</p>

<p class='c006'>If your huntsman, without inconvenience,
can begin drawing at the farthest cover down the
wind, and so draw from cover to cover up the
wind till you find, let him do it.—<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Cover</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>While hounds are drawing for a fox, let
your people place themselves in such a manner
that he cannot go off unseen. I have
known them lie in sheep’s scrapes on the side
of hills, and in small bushes, where huntsmen
never think of looking for them; yet,
when they hear a hound, they generally shift
their quarters, and make for closer covers.
Gentlemen should take this necessary part of
fox-hunting on themselves, for the whipper-in
has other business to attend to.</p>

<p class='c006'>Huntsmen, whilst their hounds are drawing,
or are at fault, frequently make so much
noise themselves, that they can hear nothing
else: they should always have an ear to a
halloo. I once saw an extraordinary instance
of the want of it in my own huntsman,
who was making so much noise with
his hounds, which were then at fault, that a
man hallooed a long while before he heard
him; and when he did hear him, so little did
he know whence the halloo came, that he rode
a couple of miles the wrong way, and lost the fox.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though a huntsman ought to be as silent as
possible at going into a cover, he cannot be too
noisy at coming out of it again; and if at any
time he should turn back suddenly, let him
give as much notice of it as he can to his
hounds, or he will leave many of them behind
him; and should he turn down the wind, he
may see no more of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are times when hounds should be
helped, and at all times they must be kept
forward: hounds will naturally tire on a cold
scent, when stopped by sheep, or other impediments;
and when they are no longer able
to get forward, will oftentimes hunt the old
scent back again, if they find that they can
hunt no other. It is the judicious encouraging
of hounds to hunt when they cannot run,
and the preventing them from losing time by
hunting too much when they might run,
that distinguishes a good sportsman from a bad
one. Hounds that have been well taught will
cast forward to a hedge of their own accord:
but you may assure yourself this excellence is
never acquired by such as are left entirely to
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though I like to see fox-hounds cast wide
and forward, and dislike to see them pick a
cold scent through flocks of sheep to no purpose,
yet I must beg leave to observe, that I
dislike still more to see that unaccountable
hurry which huntsmen will sometimes put
themselves into the moment their hounds are
at fault. Time ought always to be allowed
them to make their own cast; and if a huntsman
is judicious, he will take that opportunity
to consider what part he himself has next
to act; but instead of this, I have seen hounds
hurried away the very instant they came to a
fault, a wide cast made, and the hounds at
last brought back again to the very place from
whence they were so abruptly taken, and
where, if the huntsman had had a minute’s
patience, they would have hit off the scent
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>When your huntsman makes a cast, I hope
he makes it perfect one way before he tries
another, as much time is lost by going backwards
and forwards. You will see huntsmen,
when a forward cast does not succeed, come
slowly back again: they should return as fast
as they can.</p>

<p class='c006'>In large covers, if there are many roads, in
bad scenting days, when these roads are dry,
or after a thaw, when they carry, it is necessary
your huntsman should be near to his
hounds to help them, and hold them forward.
Foxes will run the roads at these times, and
hounds cannot always own the scent. When
they are at fault on a dry road, let not your
huntsman turn back too soon; let him not
stop till he can be certain that the fox is not
gone on. The hounds should try on both
sides the road at once: if he perceives that
they try on one side only, on his return let
him try the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a fox runs up the wind when first found,
and afterwards turns, he seldom, if ever, turns
again. This observation may not only be of
use to your huntsman in his cast, but may be
of use to you, if you should lose the hounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>When you are pursuing a fox over a country,
the scent being bad, and the fox a long
way before, without ever having been pressed,
if his point should be for strong earths that
are open, or for large covers, where game is in
plenty, it may be acting wisely to take off the
hounds at the first fault they come to; for
the fox will go many miles to your one, and
probably will run you out of all scent; but if
he should not, you will be likely to change at
the first cover you come into: when a fox has
been hard pressed, it is my opinion, that he
never should be given up.</p>

<p class='c006'>A perfect knowledge of his country certainly
is a great help to a huntsman: if yours,
as yet, has it not, great allowance ought to be
made.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a country where there are large earths,
a fox that knows the country, and tries any of
them, seldom fails to try the rest. A huntsman
may take advantage of this; they are
certain casts, and may help him to get nearer
to his fox.</p>

<p class='c006'>Great caution is necessary when a fox runs
into a village: if he is hallooed there, get
forward as fast as you can. Foxes, when tired,
will lie down anywhere, and are often lost
by it. A wide cast is not the best to recover
a tired fox with tired hounds: they should
hunt him out, inch by inch, though they are
ever so long about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>A huntsman must take care, where foxes
are in plenty, that he does not run the heel;
for it frequently happens that hounds can run
the wrong way of the scent better than they
can the right, when one is up the wind, and
the other down.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a huntsman hears a halloo, and has
five or six couple of hounds along with him,
the pack not running, let him get forward
with those which he has: when they are on
the scent, the others will soon join them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let him lift his tail hounds, and get them
forward after the rest: it can do no hurt.
But let him be cautious how he lifts any
hounds to get them forward before the rest:
it always is dangerous, and foxes are sometimes
lost by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds are hunting a cold scent, and
point towards a cover, let a whipper-in get
forward to the opposite side of it. Should the
fox break before the hounds reach the cover,
stop them, and get them nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a fox persists in running in a strong
cover, lies down often behind the hounds, and
they are slack in hunting him, let the huntsman
get into the cover to them: it may make
the fox break; it may keep him off his toil;
or may prevent the hounds from giving him up.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not often that slow huntsmen kill
many foxes: they are a check upon their
hounds, which seldom kill a fox but with a
high scent, when it is out of their power to
prevent it. Activity is the first requisite in a
huntsman to a pack of fox-hounds: a want
of it no judgment can make amends for; but
the most difficult of all his undertakings is
the distinguishing betwixt different scents, and
knowing with any certainty the scent of his
hunted fox. Much speculation is here required;
the length of time hounds remain at
fault; difference of ground; change of weather;
all these contribute to increase the difficulty,
and require a nicety of judgment, and
a precision, much above the comprehension of
most huntsmen.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds are at fault, and cannot make
it out of themselves, let the first cast be
quick; the scent is then good, nor are the
hounds likely to go over it: as the scent gets
worse, the cast should be slower, and be more
cautiously made. This is an essential part of
hunting, and which, I am sorry to say, few
huntsmen attend to. 1 wish they would remember
the following rules, viz.: that, with
a good scent, their cast should be quick; with
a bad scent, slow; and that, when the hounds
are picking along a cold scent, they are not to
cast them at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds are making a good and regular
cast, trying for the scent as they go, suffer
not your huntsman to say a word to them: it
cannot do any good, and probably may make
them go over the scent.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds come to a check, a huntsman
should observe the tail hounds: they are
least likely to over-run the scent, and he may
see by them how far they brought it. In most
packs there are some hounds that will show
the point of the fox, and, if attended to, will
direct his cast. When such hounds follow
unwillingly, he may be certain the rest of the
pack are running without a scent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Different countries require different casts:
such huntsmen as have been used to a woodland
and inclosed country, I have seen lose
time in an open country, where wide casts are
always necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>When you want to cast round a flock of
sheep, the whipper-in ought to drive them the
other way, lest they should keep running on
before you.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most huntsmen like to have all their hounds
turned after them, when they make a cast: I
wonder not at them for it, but I am always
sorry when I see it done; for till I find a
huntsman that is infallible, I shall continue to
think the more my hounds spread the better:
as long as they are within sight or hearing, it
is sufficient. Many a time have I seen an obstinate
hound hit off the scent, when an
obstinate huntsman, by casting the wrong way,
has done all in his power to prevent it. Two
foxes I remember to have seen killed in one
day by skirting hounds, whilst the huntsman
was making his cast the contrary way.</p>

<p class='c006'>When your hounds are divided into many
parts, you had better go off with the first fox
that breaks. The ground will soon get tainted,
nor will hounds like a cover where they are
often changing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The heading a fox back at first, if the cover
be not a large one, is oftentimes of service to
hounds, as he will not stop, and cannot go off
unseen. When a fox has been hard run, I
have known it turn out otherwise; and hounds
that would easily have killed him out of the
cover, have left him in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a fox has been often headed back on
one side of a cover, and a huntsman knows
there is not any body on the other side to halloo
him, the first fault his hounds come to, let
him cast that way, lest the fox should be gone
off; and if he is in the cover, he may still recover
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suffer not your huntsman to take out a
lame hound. If any are tender-footed, he will
tell you, perhaps, that they will not mind it
when they are out: probably they may not;
but how will they be on the next day? A
hound, not in condition to run, cannot be of
much service to the pack; and taking him out
at that time may occasion him a long confinement
afterwards. Put it not to the trial.</p>

<p class='c006'>All hounds go fast enough with a good
scent; but it is the particular excellence of a
fox-hound, when rightly managed, to get on
faster with an indifferent scent than any other
hound, and it is the business of a huntsman to
encourage this. Every minute you lose is
precious, and increases your difficulties; and
while you are standing still the fox is running
miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>When hounds flag from frequent changes
and a long day, it is necessary for a huntsman
to animate them as much as he can: he must
keep them forward, and press them on; for it
is not likely, in this case, that they should
over-run the scent: at these times the whole
work is generally done by a few hounds, and
he should keep close to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The many chances that are against you in
fox-hunting; the changing frequently; the
heading of the foxes; their being coursed by
sheep-dogs; long faults; cold hunting, and
the dying away of the scent; make it necessary
to keep always as near to the fox as you
can; which should be the first and invariable
principle of fox-hunting. Long days do great
hurt to a pack of fox-hounds. I set out one
day last winter from the kennel at half-past
seven, and returned home a quarter before
eight at night, the hounds running hard the
greatest part of the time. The huntsman
killed one horse and tired another, and the
hounds did not recover it for more than a
week.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The whole system of hunting is so revolutionised
that the preparation which a horse
now requires is very different to what it was
in former times. The hour of meeting is seldom
before eleven: the find generally quick
and certain; and horses are often not more
than five or six hours from their stables after
the best day’s sport; and the ground they go
over is frequently not so much as a plating
race horse performs in contending three or
four-mile heats. Having said this, I see no
reason to doubt the propriety of feeding, sweating,
and muzzling the hunter much in the
same manner as the race horse, only making
due and proper allowance for the relative nature
of their work; particularly as to not
stripping the hunter too much of his flesh; or
losing sight of the natural difference between
the thorough-bred horse and the cock-tail.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There is certainly no country in the world
where the sport of hunting on horseback is
carried to such a height as in Great Britain at
the present day, and where the pleasures of a
fox-chase are so well understood, and conducted
on such purely scientific principles. It
is considered the <i>beau ideal</i> of hunting by
those who pursue it. There can be no doubt
that it is infinitely superior to stag-hunting,
for the real sportsman can only enjoy that
chase when the deer is sought for, and found
like other game which are pursued with
hounds. In the case of finding an outlying
fallow-deer, which is unharboured in this manner,
great sport is frequently afforded; but
this is rarely to be met with in Britain. So
that fox-hunting is now the chief amusement
of the true British sportsman; and a noble
one it is: the artifices and dexterity employed
by this lively, crafty animal, to avoid the dogs,
are worthy of our admiration, as he exhibits
more devices for self-preservation than any
other beast of the chase.</p>

<p class='c006'>In many parts of this and the sister island,
hare-hunting is much followed, but fox-hunters
consider it as a sport only fit for women
and old men. But although it is less arduous
than that of the fox-chase, there are charms
attached to it which compensate for the hard
riding of the other.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The hunting match given by the Prince Esterhazy,
Regent of Hungary, upon the signing
the treaty of peace with France, was a day’s
sport, that bids fair to vie in point of blood (if
the King of Naples’ slaughter be excepted) with
any of those recorded in modern history, as
there were killed, 160 deer, 100 wild boars,
300 hares, and 80 foxes. The king had a larger
extent and a longer period for the exercise of
his talents, and it is proved that during his
journey to Vienna, in Austria, Bohemia, and
Moravia, he killed five bears, 1820 boars,

<p class='c006'><i>Anecdotes of Hunting.</i>—The late Duke
of Grafton, when hunting, was thrown into a
ditch; at the same time a young curate, calling
out “Lie still, my lord,” leaped over him,
and pursued his sport. Such an apparent want
of feeling, we may presume, was properly resented.
No such thing: on being helped out
by his attendant, his grace said, “That man
shall have the first good living that falls to my
disposal; had he stopped to have taken care of
me, I never would have given him any thing;”
being delighted with an ardour similar to his
own, or with a spirit that would not stoop to
flatter.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>“In this pursuit I (Colonel Thornton) sunk
more than once, into a quagmire, where the
prince’s whipper-in some years since, was hesitating
whether he should go to the assistance
of some hounds which had got an old stag at
bay, but on his master’s asking if he were afraid,
he immediately dashed in and sunk to rise no
more.” It is indeed reported, that neither himself
nor his horse were ever found.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>One of the sons of Gosden, whose father
was celebrated as the bold rider of Datchett,
was out upon his favourite poney with the
king’s stag hounds; he came to a part where
the present D—— of C—r—d, was refusing
a leap, when the bolder son of Nimrod,
without thinking of the importance and rank
of the person he was addressing, exclaimed,
“Stand away, and let me take it, a pretty sort
of a duke you are.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>He (the huntsman) died, some time since, at
Duffry-hall, the seat of Cæsar Colclough, Esq.
at the advanced age of ninety-six, near sixty
years of which he passed in the Colclough family.
He acted in the triple capacity of
huntsman, steward, and master of the family.
During the rebellion in 1798, he and his family
acted with uncommon fidelity to their
employers, as one of his sons, when Mr. C.
was obliged to fly, came down to protect the
house and property, and he never quitted his
post. Another of his sons brought off horses
and clothes to his master, at the risk of his
life, when he was informed where to find him,
and during that period the old man buried a
large quantity of the family plate, which he
afterwards conveyed to a place of safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>Until the last year of his life he regularly
went out with the hounds, and his voice retained
its clearness and sweetness. He was
well known to all sportsmen in that part of
Ireland.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The celebrated Saunderson, professor of
mathematics, at Cambridge, who was entirely
destitute of sight, continued to hunt until a
very advanced stage of life; his horse was accustomed
to follow that of his servant, and the
satisfaction of Saunderson was extreme when
he heard the cry of hounds and the huntsmen,
and which he used to express with all the eagerness
of those who, possessing their eye-sight,
could consequently be more gratified by the
incidents of the chase.—<i>Strutt</i>—<i>Beckford</i>—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Thornton</i>—<i>&amp;c.

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hunt</span>, <i>s.</i> A pack of hounds; a chase; pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Hunter</span>, <i>s.</i> One who chases animals for pastime; a dog that scents game
or beasts of prey; a horse employed in hunting.</p>

<p class='c006'>To obtain a useful hunter, let the person
purchase a well-bred mare, not so much regarding
her size as her points of action—particularly
requiring that she have a sound constitution
and good legs. Let him send her to a
horse of good form, <i>with freedom of action</i>
and a sound constitution; also being particular
as to the state of his legs and feet. Never let
him breed from a naturally infirm horse, whose
legs have shown more than ordinary weakness;
and, above all, let him fix upon one which
has what the veterinary profession call a short
canon; that is, the bone extending from the
knee to the fetlock, commonly called the shank
bone. Let him begin to breed from his mare
before she is much injured by work; as in
that case, if she does not breed to please him
with her first and second foal, he can dispose
of her and purchase another.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very celebrated fox-hunter has observed,
that “the goodness of the horse generally
goes in at the mouth.” Let the breeder,
then, bear this in mind, and take care that the
foal be dropped early, and the dam well fed
for the first two months with bran mashes,
carrots, &amp;c., till the spring grass arrives. If
the mare should prove a good nurse, the colt
will not require corn till he is weaned, which
on no account should be delayed beyond the
first or second week in September. Here the
grand mistake has arisen, to which we are
indebted for such numbers of mis-shapen
horses as this country abounds in. Farmers,
in general, never think of weaning their colts
till after Michaelmas, long before which period
there is little or no virtue in grass, but, on
the contrary, it is sour and unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c006'>From weaning time to the following May,
the colt should be well kept on a full allowance
of sweet hay, with at least two good feeds
of oats per day, and <i>he should be kept warm</i>.
He should have a head collar on, with a small
strap hanging down to his knees, which will
admit of his being handled every day; and
every two months his toes should be rasped,
and his heels opened a little with the drawing
knife. In March or April he should have
two mild doses of physic, which will cause
him to grow; and when the weather is warm
he should be turned out into a good upland
pasture for the summer, with plenty of shade
and water, but taken up every month to have
his legs examined and his toes rasped. The
second week in September he should be
housed again for the winter, when his belly
should be the measure for his corn. When
docked, his tail should be left eight inches in
length, which will preclude the disagreeable
necessity of having the operation repeated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early in the following spring, when turned
two years old, he should be broken, but not
backed; and physicked as before directed.
In the first or second week in June he should
be cut; and when recovered he should be
turned out for the summer. When taken up
again for the winter, he should have two mild
doses of physic, and be very well kept, giving
him a few carrots, or a large bran mash once
a week. Very early in the spring he should
have a little more very mild physic; and in
a fortnight afterwards he should be backed,
and taught his paces by a person who understands
his business. Idleness, from this time
forth, will be an enemy to him; and as soon
as he is perfect in his paces, he should do
what in the training stables is called “a little
work.” Exercise will strengthen his legs,
enlarge his muscles, improve his form, and
make him grow. From this time forth he
should be treated as a horse in every respect
but in his work, which should be moderate till
the fifth year; but previously to that time a
customer will always be ready for him, and if
his owner is disposed to part with him, his
average price will be from one to two hundred
sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I say a colt should be treated as a
horse after the third year, I mean, of course,
that he should be treated after the system I
have laid down for hunters, and not allowed
his summer’s run at grass. Hard meat will
make him powerful and handsome: grass
will render him, comparatively speaking,
heavy, pot-bellied, and shapeless.</p>

<p class='c006'>I omitted to mention one very essential
part of the education of a colt designed for a
hunter. His action—particularly that of his
shoulders—will be greatly benefited by riding
him up and down hill, and trotting him
gently in deep ground. He should also be
taught to leap at three years old. If there
should be the least appearance of a curb, the
iron should at once be applied.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The hunter should be taken up certainly
not later than the twentieth of July. Soon
after this period the nights begin to get chilly,
and his coat would receive a check if exposed
to them. It would lose that soft, silky feel,
which it generally has if the horse is in perfect
health previously to that time. When first
taken to house he should be kept as cool as
possible, and, if it can be avoided, there should
not be more than one horse in every other
stall, be the stable ever so large. As his
bowels will be relaxed by the grass he has
been eating, his physic should be milder than
usual; but that must depend upon previous
knowledge of the constitution of the horse.
Generally speaking, five drachms and a half
would be sufficient, if well prepared by bran
mashes beforehand. I do not approve of
strong physic; because it is useless to give it,
when mild, with proper preparation, will do
what is required of it; but it is not in the
power of a drachm or two of <i>good</i> aloes to
destroy a horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the time he is ready for his second dose,
he will be in some measure reconciled to the
change of temperature—from the open air to
that of a confined stable—and a little more
caution is necessary during the operation of it.
Unless the weather happens to be very warm,
he should have a hood on him if he goes out
early in the morning, and, at all events, one
warm body cloth, or his coat may receive a
check which it will not recover for some time.
If he has had his first dose, a day or two after
he was taken up—say the 20th of July—allowing
seven clear days between the <i>setting</i>
of each dose, he will be through it all by
about the 17th of August, up to which time,
and for a week afterwards, he should have
nothing but gentle walking and trotting exercise,
of about an hour and a half at a time,
before heat of the day; and by no means
should a brush be laid upon him, as it opens
the pores of his skin, and renders him more
susceptible of cold. Indeed, all the grooming
he requires at this time is to have his legs well
rubbed—particularly with the hand—three or
four times a day, and oftener if the circulation
be languid, and his body well wisped with a good
solid <i>hay</i> wisp, a little damped. Should a horse
have had some physic at grass in the summer,
or <i>late</i> in the spring, before he was turned
out, and not appear foul, it may be better to
stop a fortnight or three weeks between his
second and third dose: and, if a bit of soft
ground can be found, to give him a little
work in the time. If his two other doses did
not work him hard, it will be advisable to add
half a drachm of aloes to the third dose, as it
will take more to move his bowels now than
it did before he got the hard meat into him,
and had a little work.</p>

<p class='c006'>The condition of a horse must proceed by
slow degrees: it is the work of time; and it
is in vain to expect it on any other terms than
as the result of a long course of preparation,
followed by severe work. In a clear fortnight
after he has had his last dose of physic,
he should begin to do some work; for without
it no progress can be made. This, however,
should be gradual; and for the first
month should consist of long protracted exercise,
rather than what is called “good work.”
He should be kept out of his stable for three
or four hours in the course of the day; and if
ridden gently across a country, and now and
then with a pack of harriers (weather permitting),
it will greatly promote his condition, by
hardening his flesh, increasing his strength,
and improving his wind. At this time the
use of alteratives is indispensable. By their
mild and gradual impression a healthy action
of the bowels is obtained, and thereby what
in stable language is called “fog,” (but which
might more properly be termed debility, or
depression of strength,) is got rid of, and the
general appearance and condition of the animal
much improved. Indeed, without the
use of alterative medicines—exclusively of
physic—no hunter can be got into blooming
condition; that is to say, to look well in his
skin, to dry immediately after a sweat, and to
be in full vigour of body. Of these medicines
there are several sorts in use; but the
diuretic and diaphoretic are in my opinion the
best. It is almost needless to observe, that
the latter act upon the skin: but as sensible
perspiration in the horse is not to be obtained
by medicine without difficulty, and having
recourse to larger doses than may be safe or
convenient for him to take when at work, and
it is insensible perspiration that we wish to
obtain, these alteratives should be combined;
for it is from their gradual and almost imperceptible
operation that we are to look for the
effect we wish to produce. Antimony forms
the principal diaphoretic; and from its weight
a sufficient quantity—one ounce divided into
four parts—may be given him every day in
his corn for eight days together; but this
should be given when the weather is warm,
or danger from catching cold may arise, from
the pores of the skin being relaxed. With
proper precautions, however, none is to be apprehended,
and the effect on the general
health and appearance of the horse is striking.
If the diaphoretic alterative, in the
quantity above stated, be not given before the
horse begins to work, and the weather becomes
cold and wet, it is better to combine it
with the diuretic, by giving him a very mild
urine ball twice a week, for three weeks in
succession, with half an ounce of antimony,
finely levigated, in each ball. These medicines
combined will check that excitement of
the general habit which always accompanies a
transition from rest to work, purify the blood,
and give tone and vigour to the system.
Nitre has been much used by grooms as a
cooling diuretic, and a preventive of disease
from such causes; but it must be borne in
mind that nitre is a strong repellant, and of a
debilitating nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this, however, without a good stable,
and good stable management, is of no avail.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking next of feeding, Nimrod says:—Formerly
wheat was given to race horses,
as more nourishing than oats; but now the
latter form the chief food for all descriptions
of horses. Beans, however, have for some
time been allowed to hunters, and when given
with discretion are most beneficial. Two single
handfuls in each feed of corn is the allowance
for a hunter who is fed (as he ought to
be) five times a day.</p>

<p class='c006'>About eight pounds a-day of hay, or one truss
a-week, is considered sufficient for a hunter
that will eat five feeds of corn per day. A
larger quantity is found to increase the size,
consequently the weight of the carcase, to injure
the wind, and destroy the digestive
powers. If one handful of good hay be found
in his rack, he should have no more till next
stable time, when his appetite will be sharp.
If given to eat his straw, the setting muzzle,
in this case, must be made use of.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hunters are not always to be fed alike: allowance
should be made for the distance to
covert; for when a horse has to go twelve or
fourteen miles in a morning to meet hounds,
he may be allowed a little more hay overnight,
than if he had but four or five, as he
will empty his stomach on the road, and there
is reason to expect a long day. As to whether
a hunter should have any water on the
morning of hunting, that is a point not so
much considered as it ought to be, for we
should be guided by his constitution. If he
is apt to scour, and throw off his meat on the
road, I should recommend his having none;
but if, on the other hand, he holds his meat
well in him, has some distance to go, and is
not called on till ten or eleven o’clock in the
day, he should have six or eight swallows, or
godowns, as the grooms call them, between
five and six in the morning. This quantity
of water, or more, is always given to the race
horse on the day he runs his race, as it makes
him enjoy his food, and digest it afterwards,
and it is all absorbed by the time he is called
upon to run. Nothing is so apt to make
horses scour as change of food and water; for
which reason it is advisable that a hunter
should go from his own stable to meet hounds,
if the distance does not exceed fifteen or sixteen
miles, rather than sleep out, and be subject
to the effects alluded to. If, however, he
does sleep out, and is affected by the change,
he should be watered before he leaves home,
and have very little where he sleeps, which
will in some measure counteract the evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking of stable management, Nimrod
says:—As no man can make good work without
good tools, so no servant can do his duty
by a stud of hunters without proper materials
to go to work with. He must have a
good stable, some loose boxes, and a good
saddle-room with fire-place: he must have
lots of horse-clothes of all descriptions, bandages,
hot water, gruel, lancets, tweezers, and
a few drugs—the very best old hay and corn,
good exercising ground, and, above all, plenty
of strength in his stable; for there are two
ways of dressing a horse—one to warm him,
and the other to starve him. Dressing a
horse vigorously removes obstructions in the
smaller vessels, promotes the circulation of
the blood, and in bad weather is a substitute
for exercise.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to a horse coming round after
a hard day, even supposing him to be in the
hands of the best of grooms, that must, in
some measure, depend on the stuff he is made
of; but, generally speaking, he should come
out about the sixth day after the severest run.
If his legs have received no injury, he should
come out three times in a fortnight, at least
during the open weather; and he will be the
better for being out twice a week if there have
been no tiring days. Some horses require
much more work than others; but none of
them can go the pace, and continue it over a
country, unless they are in strong work.</p>

<p class='c006'>General rules cannot be individually applied;
but there is one respecting a hunter
which I have held inviolable; and that is,
that, under all circumstances, whether the intervals
between his hunting have been long or
short, he should have a sweat, and go for a
mile nearly at the top of his speed on the day
before hunting. I have generally adopted the
following plan:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Let some heavy clothes be put on him,
and, with a light weight on his back, let him
go at a gentle rate six or eight times around a
large field that rides a little deep, till he
sweats kindly. Let him be followed to the
place by a man with some dry clothes and a
scraper, and, taking him into some building,
or under a warm hedge, let him be well
scraped, and have on his dry clothes. Then,
if short of work, let him have a good gallop
for a mile, and walk home. This treatment,
with proper care, is unattended with any danger
of catching cold, and, if followed by a
proper allowance of hay and water, will give
him a wonderful advantage over those horses
which have not been doing what he has done,
provided he drop into a quick thing with the
hounds the next day. I have seen hunters
led to be sweated by a boy riding a hack; but
however great an advocate I may be for preserving
horses’ legs by keeping weight off
them as much as possible, yet a horse cannot,
in my opinion, be worthy the name of a hunter
if he cannot carry a boy in his exercise.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having laid some stress upon the words,
proper allowance of hay and water on the
day before hunting, I will proceed to state
what I consider that allowance to be. In the
first place, if a horse will eat his corn in the
morning without water, he should have none
till he comes in from exercise, and is done up,
which should be by ten o’clock at farthest.
He should then have half a pail of water,
and a proportion of his hay, which should not
exceed, for a moderately-sized horse, ten
pounds a day. He should then be shut up
till four, when, before he is dressed over, he
should have another half pail of water, and
no more until he returns from hunting the
next day, unless it be a few swallows on the
morning he hunts, when his groom first comes
to him. If this quantity of hay is not sufficient
to satisfy his appetite, and there is an appearance
in the morning of straw in the manger, as
if he had been eating it, the setting-muzzle
should be put on him at ten o’clock, and should
remain on him for the night, but his groom
should be with him by five in the morning, to
relieve him. He should then have his two
feeds, at an interval of an hour, and proceed
to the covert at a gentle pace. If, when there,
provided he have been treated in the way I
have prescribed, he cannot carry his rider as
he ought to do, we must conclude nature forbids
it, as he will have had every assistance
from art.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When I first began to keep hunters, we
knew nothing of those great restoratives in
the stable—flannel bandages, hot water for
the legs, and gruel. Except in case of illness
they were never thought of. An old writer
on farriery, the Sieur la Fosse, speaks of
“the great advantage of keeping horses’ legs
warm, as preventing glanders and other accidents;”
but it is only within these few years
that bandages have been applied as part of the
clothing of a hunter; the benefit of which is,
in my opinion, incalculable. By their use
circulation is kept up in those parts where it
is apt to be most languid; and the practice of
washing legs in very warm water, and swathing
them in large folds of flannel, takes off
soreness and inflammation from blows and
other injuries, which all hunters are liable to
in a run over a strong country. Another advantage
attending them is, that they admit of
a horse being shut up in half the time it formerly
required to clean him, which enables
him to lie down, or roll, which he will always
do if in a loose house, before he gets stiff from
his work.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a cleanliness in not letting a hunter
be taken into his stable until the rough
dirt which hangs about him is removed; for
which purpose he should be taken under a
shed or into another stable; and the quickest
method of removing it is by the means of a
birch-broom. Three minutes will accomplish
this. He should then be taken into his own
stable, have two or three quarts of tepid
gruel, and his feet and legs above his knees
and houghs should be well washed in water
nearly hot. When sponged well with strained
sponges, one set of bandages should be swathed
around them. His head and body should be
well dried, which, if he is full of hard meat,
will not occupy more than an hour, when he
should be shut up in a loose house, well littered
down, and a small feed of corn allowed
him. In about two hours his groom should
come to him again; his bandages should be
taken off, his legs well wisped and hand-rubbed,
his head and body lightly brushed
over, and a dry set of bandages put on. A
lukewarm mash, with a feed of oats in it, and
three parts of a pail of tepid water, with a
very small quantity of hay, will make him
comfortable for the night; and on the following
morning he should go to exercise as soon
as it is light, and be walked for an hour with
an extra cloth and a hood. He should have
tepid water all that day, and a liberal allowance
of it, with his usual oats if he will eat
them, but no beans. If his appetite fails him,
and does not return before shutting-up time
that evening, he should have half a cordial and
half a diuretic-ball mixed together; which,
with a liberal allowance of tepid water, and an
hour and a half walking exercise on the third
day, will so far recover him as to enable him
to return to his former high feed on the
fourth; on the fifth or sixth have a sweat;
and on the seventh be fit for business again
(as far, at least, as his constitution is concerned)
after the hardest day, and will carry
his rider with more ease to himself than if he
had not gone through it.—<i>Nimrod.</i></p>

It is called by some writers canine madness,
and seldom makes its appearance till a considerable
time after the bite of the rabid animal.
In some few instances it has commenced
in seven or eight days from the accident, but
generally the patient continues in health for
twenty, thirty, or forty days, or even much
longer. The bite will in general be healed
long before that time, frequently with the
greatest ease, though sometimes it resists all
kinds of healing applications, and forms a
running ulcer, which discharges a quantity of
matter for many days. The approach of the
disease is known by the cicatrix of the wound
becoming high, hard, and elevated, and by a
peculiar sense of prickling at the part; pains
shoot from it towards the throat; sometimes
it is surrounded with livid or red streaks, and
seems to be in a state of inflammation; though
often there is nothing remarkable to be observed.
The patient becomes melancholy, loves
solitude, and feels sickness at the stomach.
Sometimes the peculiar symptoms, the dread of
water, comes on all at once; sometimes the
disease begins like a common sore throat, and
the soreness daily increasing, the hydrophobic
symptoms appear like a convulsive spasm of
the muscles of the fauces. In others the mind
is first affected, and a real dread of water
arises before the patient tries whether he can
swallow it. But in whatever manner this
symptom comes on, the most painful sensations
accompany every attempt to swallow
liquids. Nay, the bare sight of water, or any
thing clear, will give the utmost uneasiness, or
even throw the patient into convulsions. The
patient, however, is not as yet deprived of
reason; some have, merely by the dint of
resolution, conquered the dread of water,
though they never could overcome the convulsive
motions which the contact of liquids
occasioned: and yet this has been of no avail;
for the convulsions and other symptoms increasing
have always overpowered the individual
at last, and a great flow of viscid saliva
into the mouth now takes place, and it has the
same effect upon the fauces that other liquids
have. This therefore is blown off with violence,
which in a patient of Doctor Fothergill’s
occasioned a noise like the barking of a dog.
Patients then have an insatiable thirst, but
are unable to get down any drink without the
utmost difficulty, though sometimes they can
swallow bread soaked in liquids, slices of
oranges, or other fruits. There is a pain under
the scrobiculus cordis, as in the tetanus.
But the symptoms are so various, that they
cannot be enumerated, for we seldom read
two cases of hydrophobia which do not differ
very remarkably. Sometimes every member
is convulsed by fits, but most violently from
the navel up to the breast and œsophagus.
The fit comes on perhaps every quarter of an
hour; the fauces are not red, nor the tongue
dry; the pulse is not at all feverish; and,
when the fit is over, nearly like a sound pulse.
The face grows pale, then brown, and during
the fits almost black, the lips livid; the head
is drowsy, and the ears tingling; the urine
limpid. At last the patient is weary, the fits
are less violent, the pulse becomes weak, intermittent,
and not very quick; and at last
the whole body becomes cold. If the patient
can get sleep, so he will expire. The blood
drawn before death appears good in every
respect. The hydrophobia seems to be a
symptom peculiar to the human race; for the
mad animals which communicate the infection
do not seem to have any dread of water.
If the disease once exhibits its symptoms in
a human patient, the chances for recovery are
small indeed; there having never been one
well authenticated case of the recovery of a
really hydrophobous person. Prevention is
the only chance, and removal of the contagious
matter the only fair hope of preserving
life. Of all the means of removal, the cutting
out the part to which the tooth had been
applied is unquestionably the most effectual.
This therefore should not be delayed; one
quarter of an hour’s hesitation will sometimes
prove fatal. But besides cutting away the
part, careful washing may be used. Cold
water should be poured upon the wound from
a considerable height, that the matter may be
washed away with some force. Even after
removal by the knife, careful washing is still
proper. And after both these, to prevent, as
far as can be, the possibility of any contagious
matter lurking about the wounded part, it
should not be allowed to heal, but a discharge
of matter should be supported for several
weeks by ointment with cantharides, or similar
applications; by these means there is the
best chance of removing the matter at a sufficiently
early period. Prevention may also be
obtained by the destruction of the contagious
matter at the part; and where there is the
least reason to think that a complete removal
has not been obtained, these should always be
had recourse to. With this intention the actual
cautery, and burning with gunpowder,
have been employed; and fire is doubtless
one of the most powerful agents that can be
used for this purpose. Recourse has also been
had to washing, both with acids and alkalies.
Of the former vinegar has been chiefly used,
but more may be expected from the latter,
particularly from the caustic alkali, so far diluted
that it can be applied with safety; for
from its influence as a solvent of animal mucus,
it gives a better chance of a complete
removal of the poison.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The injured part must be destroyed, or be
cut out. Destroying it is the most safe and
certain, and the best applications for that purpose
are the lapis infernalis and the butter of
antimony. These are preferable to a hot
iron, which the ancients used, because a hot
iron forms a crust that acts as a defence to
the under parts instead of destroying them.
The lapis infernalis is much better than any
other caustic, as it melts and penetrates during
its application. The bitten part must be
destroyed to the bottom, and where there is
any doubt that the bottom of the wound is
not sufficiently reached, butter of antimony
should be introduced occasionally as deep as
possible, and incisions should be made, if necessary,
to lay open every part to the influence
of the caustic. In desperate cases incisions
should be made round the wound to prevent
the virus from spreading. The wound is to
be dressed for some time with poultices, to
assuage the inflammation caused by the caustics,
and afterwards with acrid dressings and
hot digestives, to create a discharge and drain
the injured parts.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is my practice, and I recommend it to
others when called to patients bitten by a
mad dog, to try them immediately, and from
time to time, with water, slopping it first
into a pewter pot, and from thence back to
the basin a few times, in order to detect as
early as possible the hydrophobia, or first decided
symptom produced by the poison of a
mad dog.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>An Italian surgeon of the hospital at Moscow,
being in the Ukraine in 1813, was requested
to give assistance to fifteen persons,
who had received the bite of a mad dog. A
deputation of elders waited upon him, and
entreated him to administer help to the unfortunate
persons through a peasant, who, during
several years, had acquired great reputation
for curing hydrophobia. M. Marochetti
consented upon certain conditions. The country
doctor then administered to fourteen of
the persons confided to him in a peculiar way.
The fifteenth, a young girl of fifteen, was
treated in the ordinary manner, for the purpose
of proving the effect of both modes of
treatment. To each of the fourteen he gave
daily one pound and a half of the decoction
of the buds of yellow broom flowers, and he
examined twice a day under the tongue the
place where, according to his statement, little
swellings were formed containing the virus of
madness. These swellings rose on the third
or ninth day, and were seen by M. Marochetti.
Very soon after they appeared, they were
touched with a red hot needle, after which the
patient gargled the part with the decoction of
broom. The result of this treatment was
that the fourteen patients were cured in six
weeks, whilst the young girl, treated differently,
died on the seventh day in the convulsions
of madness. Three years after M.
Marochetti paid a visit to the fourteen persons,
and they were all doing well. The same physician
being at Padolia, in 1818, had a new
opportunity of confirming this interesting discovery.
The happy result of this mode of
treatment was the same with twenty-six persons,
who had all been bit by a mad dog.—<i>Gazette

five or six eggs, paler than those of the crow,
and smaller; they rarely build in trees; in
Hampshire they sometimes breed in the rabbit
burrows. They are easily tamed, and may
be taught to pronounce several words; they
will conceal part of their food, and with it
small pieces of money, or toys. They feed
on insects, grain, fruit, and small pieces of
flesh; and are said to be fond of partridges’
eggs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James’s Powder</i> is composed chiefly of
antimony, and similar to that which is sold in

As a horse medicine, the latter is as useful
and efficacious as James’s Powder. It is an
excellent medicine in fevers of every kind;

never gave less than two drachms, and sometimes
three; and has seen even one ounce
given at a dose without the least inconvenience.
It appears to act on the skin like tartar emetic,
promoting insensible perspiration; its effect
is not so certain. It is sometimes joined with
opium, camphor, nitre, or ginger, according to
the nature of the disease: with ginger it is
prescribed for horses that are hide-bound;
but this compound is not proper in fevers, or
any complaint arising from inflammation. It
is most commonly given with nitre and camphor;

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Jaundice</span>, <i>s.</i> A distemper from obstructions of the glands of the liver.</p>

<p class='c006'>A peculiar yellowness of the membranes of
the eyes and mouth sometimes attends certain
disorders, which have on that account
been named yellows, or jaundice. Those disorders
consist in great heaviness of the head,
a peculiar languor and disinclination to motion,
yellowness, or a yellowish redness of the
inner surface of the eyelids, while little or no
dung is voided, and that little has mucus or
slime on its surface; the urine is scanty, and
high-coloured; in short there is great torpor
in all the organs of the body. This disorder
generally happens towards autumn, or the
latter part of summer, and may be caused, in
some measure, by the heat of the weather, as
well as by feeding immoderately, especially
upon hay, when it happens to be remarkably
good and sweet, such hay always tempting a
horse to eat immoderately: but it is produced
by immoderate feeding upon any kind of hay,
or even of corn. By this excess of food, assisted
by the heat of the weather, the stomach
is weakened, and the bowels become torpid;
the large bowels are in consequence loaded
with excrement, and the mesenteric veins with
blood. Hence the liver also becomes loaded
with blood, and performs its office imperfectly;
the bile therefore seems to be forced back upon
the circulation, or re-absorbed, and thus the
blood and all the secretions are tinged of a yellow
colour. The high colour of the membrane
of the eye is caused by the determination of
blood to the head, when the blood is forced
into vessels which in health convey only a colourless
and transparent fluid; and as the whole
mass of blood is loaded with bile, it appears in
those minute vessels of a yellow colour: and
generally that yellowness in the membranes
under the eyelids approaches towards redness,
or the colour of an orange. Bleeding is the
first remedy in this disorder; nor should blood
be taken off in small quantities at a time, from
a fear of increasing the animal’s apparent weakness,
which depends more upon the brain being
oppressed with blood than any thing else, but
in a full quantity, that is, to the extent of from
one to two gallons, or until the horse becomes
faint. The bowels should then be unloaded
by means of clysters and a purgative ball.</p>

<p>THE JAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful bird is not more than thirteen
inches in length. Its bill is black, eyes
white; the feathers on the forehead are white,
streaked with black, and form a tuft which it
can erect and depress at pleasure; the chin is
white, and from the corners of the bill on
each side proceeds a broad streak of black,
which passes under the eye; the hinder part
of the head, the neck, and the back, are of a
light cinnamon colour; the breast is of the
same colour, but lighter; lesser wing coverts
bay; the belly and vent almost white; the
greater wing coverts are elegantly barred with
black, fine pale blue and white alternately;
the greater quills are black, with pale edges,
the bases of some of them white; lesser quills
black; those next the body, chestnut; the
rump is white; tail black, with pale brown
edges; legs dirty pale brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The jay is a very common bird in Great
Britain, and is found in various parts of Europe.
It is distinguished as well for the
beautiful arrangement of its colours, as for its
harsh grating voice, and restless disposition.
Upon seeing the sportsman, it gives by its
cries the alarm of danger, and thereby defeats
his aim and disappoints him. The jay builds
in woods, and makes an artless nest, composed
of sticks, fibres, and tender twigs; the female
lays five or six eggs, of a greyish ash colour,
mixed with green, and faintly spotted with
brown. Mr. Pennant observes, that the young
ones continue with their parents till the following
spring, when they separate to form
new pairs. Birds of this species live on acorns,
nuts, seeds, and various kinds of fruits; they
will eat eggs, and sometimes destroy young
birds in the absence of the old ones. When
kept in a domestic state they may be rendered
very familiar, and will imitate a variety of
words and sounds. We have heard one imitate
the sound made by the action of a saw so
exactly, that though it was on a Sunday, we
could hardly be persuaded that the person
who kept it, had not a carpenter at work in
the house. Another, at the approach of cattle,
had learned to hound a cur dog upon them,
by whistling and calling upon him by his
name: at last, during a severe frost, the dog
was, by that means, excited to attack a cow
big with calf, when the poor animal fell on
the ice, and was much hurt: the jay was complained
of as a nuisance, and its owner was
obliged to destroy it.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This curious process consists in attaching to
the part that remains an exact substitute for
the piece lost. For this purpose the falconer
is always provided with pinions, (right and
left,) and with tail-feathers of hawks, or with
the feathers separated from the pinion, carefully
preserved and numbered, so as to prevent
mistake in taking a true match for the
injured feather. He then with a sharp knife
gently parts the web of the feather to be repaired,
at its thickest part, and cuts the shaft
obliquely forward, so as not to damage the
web on the opposite edge. He next cuts the
substitute feather as exactly as possible at the
corresponding point, and with the same slope.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the purpose of uniting them, he is provided
with an iron needle, with broad triangular
points at both ends; and after wetting
the needle with salt and water, he thrusts it
into the centre of the pith of each part, as
truly straight, and as nearly to the same
length in each as may be. When this operation
has been skilfully performed, the junction
is so neat that an inexperienced eye would
hardly discern the point of union; and as the
iron rusts, from having been wetted with
brine, there is little or no danger of separation.—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Incubation</span>, <i>s.</i> The act of sitting upon eggs to hatch them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Incubation.</i>—It is probable birds are endowed
with an instinctive power of regulating
the necessary heat for this purpose; of course,
should the heat of the air, together with the
natural warmth of the body, on the close contact
of the bird to the eggs, be too great, her
feelings would dictate the necessity of leaving
them for a time to cool. At the early period
of incubation birds quit their eggs more frequently
than at the time the fetus is more perfect.
Yet, in the advanced state, the embryo
young is not in more danger of being destroyed,
if so much; for we have frequently found a
living fetus in an egg that has been taken from
the nest two days. If, however, the young is
within a few hours of being excluded, and the
egg is suffered to be some time cold, it either
dies, or becomes so weak as not to be able to
extricate itself from the shell. Various degrees
of heat will enlarge the embryo young,
but regular heat seems necessary to its production;
and yet artificial heat, regulated by
the brooding of a bird, will not produce young
with such certainty. In Egypt, a vast quantity
of eggs are hatched by artificial heat in
stoves. It is probable, however, one third or
one fourth miscarry. The necessary heat for
this purpose is about ninety-six degrees of
Fahrenheit’s thermometer, or thirty-two of
Reaumur’s scale. Birds frequently turn and
change the situation of their eggs in the nest;
besides this, it is possible that the moisture
of the bird’s body may assist the natural
growth of the fœtus and the production of the
young.</p>

<p class='c006'>The male birds of some species supply the
place of the female on the nest; but then it is
of short duration, and rarely, if ever, when the
eggs are near hatching; at that time the female
is frequently fed by the male. This is not
common to all species, but very conspicuous
in the rook, the pigeon, and many others.
Many species of birds possess a reservoir for
food, called a craw, or crop; this seems to answer
the same purpose as the first stomach in
ruminating animals. Here it is the food is softened
and prepared for the stomach; from this
reservoir it is by some ejected for the purpose
of feeding their young; conspicuous in the
pigeon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rook has a small pouch under the
tongue, in which it carries food to its young.
It is probable the use of the craw may be extended
further than is generally imagined; for
besides the common preparation of the food to
assist its digestion in the stomach, there are
some species that actually secrete a lacteal
substance in the breeding season, which, mixing
with the half-digested food, is ejected to
feed and nourish the young. The mammæ,
from which this milky liquor is produced, are
situated on each side the upper part of the
breast, immediately under the craw. In the
female turtle dove we have met with these
glands tumid with milky secretion, and we
believe it common to both sexes of the dove
genus. The cormorant or pelican genus possess
no craw; but, to supply its place, they have
a loose skin at the base of the under mandibles,
capable of great distension, in which they
carry fish to their young. The bustard is said
to possess a bag of an astonishing size, for the
purpose of retaining water; but the most unaccountable
and extraordinary formation in the
trachea of many of the males of the duck genus,
called a labyrinth, is beyond our reach to
discover the use of, as well as the singular
flexure in the windpipe of the hooping swan

<p class='c006'><i>Attention during Incubation.</i>—There is
this distinction in the hen: in some, the desire
of sitting or incubation is predominant,
which they will repeat to the fifth or sixth
time in the year, to their emaciation or almost
destruction: in others the desire is so slight,
that they will probably sit but twice, or even
once in the season, and then not steadily. It
is for the skilful breeder to take advantage of
this variation of quality, the one kind furnishing
plenty of eggs for the other to sit upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is proper to place corn and water beside
the sitting hen, whenever it may appear necessary,
withdrawing them as soon as she is
satisfied, not only to encourage steadiness
of incubation, but to support the constitutions
of those in which the natural excitement
is so powerful, that they will remain
several successive days upon the nest, at the
risk of famishing. I have had instances of
hens of this description fainting outright, and
appearing as dead, on their finally leaving the
nest with the chickens, in a state of total
emaciation, having, probably, not eaten or
drank more than once in three or four days,
during the term of their incubation, twenty-one
days. The plan of feeding on the nest
should be invariably pursued with all frequent
sitters.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>They who write on natural history cannot
too frequently advert to instinct, that wonderful
limited faculty, which, in some instances,
raises the brute creation as it were above reason,
and in others leaves them so far below it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been remarked that every species of
bird has a mode of nidification peculiar to itself;
so that a schoolboy would at once pronounce
on the sort of nest before him. This
is the case among fields and woods and wilds;
but, in the villages round London, where
mosses and gossamer, and cotton from vegetables,
are hardly to be found, the nest of the
chaffinch has not that elegant, finished appearance,
nor is it so beautifully studded with lichens,
as in a more rural district; and the wren is
obliged to construct its house with straws and
dry grasses, which do not give it that rotundity
and compactness so remarkable in the
edifices of that little architect. Again, the
regular nest of the house martin is hemispheric;
but where a rafter, or a joist, or a cornice,
may happen to stand in the way, the nest is
so contrived as to conform to the obstruction,
and becomes flat, or oval, or compressed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following instances instinct is perfectly
uniform and consistent. There are three
creatures, the squirrel, the field-mouse, and
the bird called the nuthatch (<i>Sitta Europæa</i>)
which live much on hazel-nuts; and yet they
open them each in a different way. The
first, after rasping off the small end, splits the
shell in two with his long fore-teeth, as a man
does with his knife; the second nibbles a hole
with his teeth, as regular as if drilled with a
wimble, and yet so small that one would wonder
how the kernel can be extracted through
it: while the last picks an irregular ragged
hole with its bill: but as this artist has no
paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it,
like an adroit workman, he fixes it, as it were,
in a vice, in some cleft of a tree, or in some
crevice; when, standing over it, he perforates
the stubborn shell. We have often placed
nuts in the chink of a gate-post where nuthatches
have been known to haunt, and have
always found that those birds have readily
penetrated them. While at work they make
a rapping noise that may be heard at a considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is no doubt exceedingly difficult, and perhaps
impossible, to define where instinct ends,
and reason begins, in animals. But that some
of them are endowed with a faculty which
does not come under the usual notion of instinct,
by whatever other name we may choose
to call it, will, I think, hardly allow of a dispute.
This, as it strikes me, appears in the
different degrees of intelligence which we are
accustomed to recognize as elevating one species
of animal above another,—as the half-reasoning
elephant for instance, and the friend
of man, the dog, above numberless others.
Now, instinct of one tribe, one would think,
as much as in another, must be full and perfect,
and would not admit of our considering
the degree of intelligence manifested in one
species as higher or lower than that possessed
by another. Again: much more must we
conceive that the proper instinct of any species
will be fully, and therefore equally, possessed
by all individuals of that species. How,
then, upon the notion of mere instinct, shall
we account for that superiority of intelligence,
which is found in one individual, to others of
the same species, and which is familiar to those
who are employed about, or in any way in the
habit of conversing with, animals? But the
observation which appears to me most decidedly
to carry the faculties of animals to
something exceeding the measure and character
of instinct, is that of the new and ingenious
contrivances to which they will often have
recourse in situations, and upon occasions,
much too accidental and peculiar to admit of
our imagining that they could have been contemplated
and provided against in the regular
instinct of the whole species. This we should
naturally be disposed to conceive must have
been given to regulate the ordinary habits of
the animals, and adapted to those exigencies
of their mode of life which are continually
occurring, not to such as do rarely, and might,
one would be tempted to say, never occur. A
few instances will, perhaps, better explain
what I mean, and carry more persuasion than
my argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was one day feeding the poor elephant
(who was so barbarously put to death at
Exeter ’Change) with potatoes, which he took
out of my hand. One of them, a round one,
fell on the floor, just out of the reach of his
proboscis. He leaned against his wooden bar,
put out his trunk, and could just touch the
potato, but could not pick it up. After several
ineffectual efforts, he at last blew the
potato against the opposite wall with sufficient
force to make it rebound, and he then, without
difficulty, secured it. Now it is quite
clear, I think, that instinct never taught the
elephant to procure his food in this manner;
and it must, therefore, have been reason, or
some intellectual faculty, which enabled him
to be so good a judge of cause and effect.
Indeed, the reflecting power of some animals
is quite extraordinary. I had a dog who was
much attached to me, and who, in consequence
of his having been tied up on a Sunday morning,
to prevent his accompanying me to church,
would conceal himself in good time on that
day, and I was sure to find him either at the
entrance of the church, or, if he could get in,
under the place where I usually sat.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gentleman, a good shot, lent a favourite
old pointer to a friend who had not much to
accuse himself of in the slaughter of partridges,
however much he might have frightened
them. After ineffectually firing at some
birds which the old pointer had found for him,
the dog turned away in apparent disgust, went
home, and never could be persuaded to accompany
the same person afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been often much delighted with
watching the manner in which some of the
old bucks in Bushy Park contrive to get the
berries from the fine thorn-trees there. They
will raise themselves on their hind legs, give
a spring, entangle their horns in the lower
branches of the tree, give them one or two
shakes, which make some of the berries fall,
and they will then quietly pick them up.—<i>White’s

<p class='c006'>Hanging from the upper edge of the pupil
of the horse, are found two or three round
black bodies, as large as millet seeds. When
the horse is suddenly brought into an intense
light, and the pupil is closed, these bodies present
a singular appearance, being squeezed out
from between the edges of the iris. An equal
number, but much smaller, are attached to the
edge of the lower portion of the iris. Their
general use is probably to intercept portions of
light which would be troublesome or injurious;
but their principal function is accomplished
during the act of grazing. They are
larger on the upper edge of the iris, and are
placed on the outer side of the pupil, evidently
to obstruct the light in those directions
in which it would come with greatest force,
both from above and even from below, while
at the same time, the field of view is perfectly
open, so far as it regards the pasture on
which the horse is grazing.</p>

way, connected with this black point behind.

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Irish Horse</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>In some of the rich grazing counties, as
Meath and Roscommon, a large long blood
horse is reared of considerable value, but he
seldom has the elegance of the English horse;
he is larger headed, more leggy, ragged-hipped,
angular, yet with great power in the quarters,
much depth beneath the knee, stout and hardy,
full of fire and courage, and the best leaper in
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Irish horse is generally smaller than
the English. He is stinted in his growth, for
the poverty and custom of the country have
imposed upon him much hard work, at a time
when he is unfit for labour of any kind. For
this reason, too, the Irish horse is deficient in
speed. There is, however, another explanation
of this. The Irish thorough-bred horse
is not equal to the English. He is comparatively
a weedy, leggy, worthless animal, and
very little of him enters into the composition
of the hunter or the hackney.</p>

<p class='c006'>For leaping, the Irish horse is unrivalled.
It is not, however, the leaping of the English
horse, striding as it were over a low fence, and
stretched at his full length over a higher one;
it is the proper jump of the deer, beautiful to
look at, difficult to sit, and, both in height and
extent, unequalled by the English horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Iron is found in every part of the globe, in
the soil, in the water, and as a constituent of

of iron, used in medicine, are, 1st, sulphate
of iron, or salt of steel; 2d, muriate
of iron; 3d, subcarbonate of iron; 4th, tartarised
iron; 5th, red oxide of iron, or colcothar
of vitriol; 6th, rust of iron; and,
7th, scales of iron. They are all powerful
tonics in the human body, but not often given
to horses. The dose of No. 1, is from 1 drachm
to 3. No. 2, 1 drachm to 2 or 3. No. 3, 2

4 drachms to 6. No. 6, 2 drachms to 4. No. 7,
2 drachms to 4, finely powdered. Preparations
of iron are generally mixed with aromatics,
and sometimes with soda. Metallic preparations
should be used with great caution. Iron
is the most innocent, and possessed of considerable
tonic power; but, before it is employed,
wholesome food, moderate exercise, and good
grooming, should have a fair trial.</p>

<p class='c006'>The judcock, in its figure and plumage,
nearly resembles the common snipe;
but it is only about half its weight, seldom
exceeding two ounces, or measuring more,
from the tip of its beak to the end of its
tail, than eight inches and a half: the bill
is black at the tip, and light towards the base,
and rather more than an inch and a half in
length. A black streak divides the head
lengthwise from the base of the bill to the nape
of the neck, and another, of a yellowish colour,
passes over each eye to the hinder part
of the head: in the midst of this, above the
eye, is a narrow black stripe running parallel
with the top of the head from the crown to
the nape. The neck is white, spotted with
brown and pale red. The scapulars and tertials
are very long and beautiful; on their exterior
edges they are bordered with a stripe of
yellow, and the inner webs are streaked and
marked with bright rust colour on a deep
brown, or rather bronze ground, reflecting in
different lights a shining purple or green. The
quills are dusky. The rump is of a glossy
violet or bluish purple; the belly and vent
white. The tail consists of twelve pointed
feathers of a dark brown, edged with rust colour;
the legs are of a dirty or dull green.</p>

<p class='c006'>The judcock is of nearly the same character
as the snipe, it feeds upon the same kinds of
food, lives and breeds in the same swamps and
marshes, and conceals itself from the sportsman
with as great circumspection, among the
rushes or tufts of coarse grass. It, however,
differs in this particular, that it seldom rises
from its lurking place until it is almost trampled
upon, and, when flushed, does not fly to so great
a distance. It is as much esteemed as the snipe,
and is cooked in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Kennel.</i>—Is the place where hounds are
kept; upon the judicious construction of which,
their health, safety, and preservation, are
known greatly to depend. Those who take to,
or become possessed of, kennels ready built, frequently
continue them in the form they fall
into their hands; but such as encounter the
expense of new erections, cannot do better than
take a previous survey of the most approved
plans; amongst which the Duke of Bedford’s
at Woburn Abbey; the Duke of Richmond’s
at Goodwood, in Sussex; and Sir William
Rawley’s at Tendring Hall, Suffolk, are supposed,
for extent and convenience, to take the
lead of most others in the kingdom. Taste
and fashion may go a great way in the external
glare of such establishments; but health
and convenience should always prove the most
predominant considerations. It is universally
admitted, by all who have a practical knowledge
of this subject, that in large and regularly
hunted packs, two kennels are indispensably
necessary to the success and well doing
of the whole. When there is but one, it can
in the winter season be but seldom cleaned;
and even then the hounds are in a comfortless
state, from the dampness of the situation so
long as it remains. Cleanliness is so essentially
necessary in every apartment and department
of a kennel, that no continuance of
health in the hounds, or excellence in the field,
can be expected without it. They are individually
innately clean; and will never, if they
can avoid it, dung near where they lie. Air,
fresh straw, and ample room for the occasional
expansion of their weary limbs, are requisite
for the invigoration of the frame, and the preservation
of health. Hounds confined in a
body are more liable to disease than the same
animal single, and in a state of unrestrained
liberty; hence the necessity for counteraction,
by every means the most prudent precaution
can adopt. Hounds thus subject to, and constantly
attacked with disease, and even madness,
under the best and most judicious management,
must be evidently much more so
if surrounded with filth and nastiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>That some idea may be formed of the grandeur
of the buildings, and the liberal scale, of
the most celebrated hunting establishments, it
is only necessary to introduce a few explanatory
remarks upon the kennels of eminence
already mentioned. The superb edifice of the
Duke of Richmond is said (and probably with
great truth) to have cost £10,000, in its erection;
to which his Grace contributed no small
proportion of personal assistance. He is reported
to have been his own architect and
builder; to have dug his own flints, burnt his
own lime, made his own bricks, and framed
the woodwork in his own shops. The dog
kennel, abstracted from all other buildings,
stands alone, in such part of the park as to
form a grand and striking object from the principal
rooms of the mansion; the materials are
flints, finished at all the angles by a light grey-brick,
like the Lymington white stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distribution of the building is into five
compartments: two of them thirty-six feet
by fifteen, and three more thirty by fifteen;
these are called kennels, to which are annexed
two feeding rooms, twenty-eight by fifteen.
In each of these are openings at top,
for the admission of external air when necessary,
and stoves to qualify the air when too
cold. There are supplies of water, and drains
into a tank a considerable depth below, full of
rain water, from the surface of which to the
rise of the arch is eleven feet, so that no inconvenience
arises from smell, and the whole
can be occasionally cleared off by drains to
more dependent depths and dung pits, where
it becomes contributory to the purposes of
agriculture. Round the whole building is a
pavement five feet wide; airing yards, places
for breeding, and other conveniences, making
a part of each wing. To constitute a uniformity
of elegance, neatness, and perfection,
the huntsman and whipper-in have each a
parlour, kitchen, and sleeping-room, appropriated
to their own particular purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Duke of Bedford’s is an immense
establishment, upon a scale of too much extent
for particular description, as it includes
tennis court, riding-house, &amp;c., &amp;c., in one
stone-fronted building, of 266 feet in length,
with two wings of stables, containing stalls for
thirty-six hunters; and eleven loose houses
for horses sick and lame. As the dog kennel,
however, is the only part entitled to
notice under this head, it will create no surprise
that the richest subject should possess
the most complete in England.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is in length 405 feet, having the boiling
house in the centre, with feeding rooms adjoining,
and a granary behind. On the right
of the centre are apartments for two kennel-keepers,
two long lodging rooms for the hunting
hounds, with flues running along the wall
to preserve an equal temperature in the severity
of the winter season; spacious yards to
each, furnished with a fountain in the middle,
for the dogs to drink at; and water-cocks fixed
at proper distances to cleanse the pavement
when it may be required; adjoining to these
are seven hospitals for sick and lame hounds,
with yards to each. On the left are divisions
for litter, straw, &amp;c.; eleven apartments for
bitches and puppies, with yards to each; eleven
ditto for bitches in pup, with yards also; and
a large division for bitches at heat. In the
front is a large reservoir of water, which supplies
the fountains and different cocks in the
several yards within. Behind the whole is a
large airing-ground, flesh-house, and all requisite
conveniences. The huntsman’s dwelling-house
is a handsome building adjoining. The
number of hunting hounds kept in the kennel
are usually from sixty to seventy couple.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kennel of Sir William Rawley is by
no means equal to the external grandeur of
the two already described, but replete with
every internal convenience that an establishment
upon a somewhat smaller scale can possibly
require. It is situate about half a mile
from the family mansion, from the garden of
which it constitutes a picturesque appearance.
It is erected in a valley of the park, a spot
well adapted to the purpose, being equally
defended from the cutting easterly winds, and
the heat of the sun in its meridian, by a thick
skirting of the park and forest trees. Not
having the advantage of a rivulet to the water
courts, that want is amply supplied by a pump
which, by means of different cocks, turns the
water to every part of the premises, consisting
of the hunting kennel, or principal lodging-room,
which is twenty feet by eighteen in the
clear, eighteen feet high, and paved with flag-stones.
The beds or benches which cover
almost the whole area, are of original and
most admirable contrivance, being lathed like
some bedsteads, and are made to fold up with
joints, for the convenience of washing the
floor beneath them. This room, by means
of a flue of a peculiar construction, is heated
to any required temperature; and the hounds
after severe chases and in wet weather are
rendered dry and comfortable in a much less
time than they could be by any other means.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is also a kennel or lodging room for
the young hounds, of the same dimensions as
the former, and possessing the same conveniences
except the flue, which here would have
been superfluous. Several small kennels for
bitches in a state of gestation, as well as a
proportional number for those with puppies;
a paved court to the hunting kennel; a feeding
house, one-half of which is open, the
other under cover; a paved court to the kennel
for the young hounds; a pump and a
stone water cistern; a large grass yard for
airing the hounds belonging to the hunting
kennel, containing about an acre and three-quarters,
in which are a variety of lime, chestnut,
and other trees, forming an excellent
shade for the hounds during the summer season;
the young hounds have a similar convenience.
To these are annexed twelve small
kennels for puppies, well constructed for the
purpose. The hunting hounds generally consist
of about thirty-six couple, and the establishment
is conducted in such a style of
punctuality, order, and excellence, that it is
universally acknowledged equal to any and
inferior to none upon a similar scale, from
one extremity of the kingdom to the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next to the choice of a proper spot for, and
a judicious as well as a convenient structure
of the kennel, the management of the hounds,
when there, becomes a matter of serious consideration,
and requires a feeder of strict
sobriety, indefatigable industry, invariable
punctuality, great humanity, personal fidelity
to his employer, and a constant attention to
the business in which he is engaged, as upon
him in a great degree depends the health and
preservation of the hounds. Mr. Beckford
observes (in great proof of his practical knowledge
and personal experience) that no part
of the hunting establishment goes on so well
as when the master becomes an occasional
superintendent of his own concerns. He says,
as the sport in the field depends on the exquisite
sense of smelling so peculiar to the hound,
so care should be taken to preserve it, and
cleanliness is the surest means. The keeping
of the kennel sweet and clean, cannot therefore
be too strongly inculcated and impressed
upon the mind of the feeder; if he seems
habitually disposed to deviate from which, he
is not at all calculated for the office he has
undertaken.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preparation for feeding, as boiling the
meat, mixing the meal, and getting it ready
at the hours agreed on, is a matter that the
huntsman will of course take care (on his
part) never to have neglected; but there are
other considerations equally important, which
become entitled to attention. Hounds cannot
be properly fed by a single person; two are
(for a variety of reasons) unavoidably necessary,
and those two should be the feeder and
the huntsman, as hounds should be drafted
and fed according to their state of flesh and
condition. Some are much more voracious
than others, and will require a greater portion
of food; others look and work well with half
the quantity. The eye of the huntsman
should discriminate between the opposite descriptions;
in want of which attention the
pack will never be of equal appearance. When
any of the hounds are observed to be low in
flesh, off their appetites, bad feeders, or kept
under by the old and master hounds, it will
be a matter of advantage to draft them, and
let them feed under less restraint. Young
and impatient feeders fall into the very common
fault of feeding hounds with their meat
too hot; it is both a prevalent and injurious
error that should be totally abolished.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Beckford is of opinion, that hounds
poorer than the rest should be fed again, and
that they cannot be fed too often; as well as
that those hounds which become too fat, if
any, should be drafted off, and not permitted
to fill themselves. All hounds (particularly
young ones) should be often called over in
kennel; their names become more familiar to
them, and it teaches them obedience; this
lesson is practised, or should be, at the time
of feeding. Hounds should all be let out
into the airing ground to empty themselves
after feeding, to prevent an unnecessary accumulation
of filth and consequent effluvia in
the kennel. It may be a custom with some
to shut up the hounds for two or three hours
after they return from hunting, before they
are fed; if so, it is more entitled to contempt
than imitation. No plea can justify the practice;
they should have their meat ready for
feeding immediately on their return; once
gratified they enjoy their rest undisturbed,
the best and most natural foundation for renovation
of strength. Plenty of vegetables,
boiled in the meat copper once a week, is a
custom in most kennels, as it is also to throw
in a pound or two of sulphur (in proportion
to the number), particularly in the summer
season, when there is a greater tendency in
the blood to morbidity, particularly to cutaneous
diseases.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the hot months, when hounds do
not work, they require but a small proportion
of substantial food, compared to what is necessary
in the severity of the hunting season;
flesh may then be given very sparingly; the
less it is used in the summer, the less likelihood
there will be of seeing that malignant and
unwelcome visiter, the mange, amongst them.
Various opinions has been promulgated upon
the best, cheapest, and most nutritious food
for the support of the hounds in general; but
experience seems to have justified the consistency
of occasional changes, according to the
different seasons, and the different degrees of
work; without adhering too closely to one particular
mode, unassisted by such deviations as
circumstances may render not only prudent
and proper, but sometimes unavoidable. Horseflesh,
sheep’s trotters, raspings, greaves, bullocks’
paunches, (in a scarcity of flesh,) oatmeal,
and barley meal, constitute the principal
articles upon which hounds are known to subsist;
although they are differently prepared,
and differently administered, according to the
judgment, experience, whim, or caprice, of the
parties concerned. It is, however, universally
admitted, after a number of fair and impartial
trials, that, in respect to the two meals, they
act much more profitably and advantageously,
when used in a mixed state of nearly equal proportions,
than when either is given alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Beckford says, his feeder, who was a
good one, and of much experience, mixed the
meal in equal quantities; that the oatmeal he
boiled for half an hour; and then put out the
fire, adding the barley meal, and mixing both
together; his reason for boiling one, and not
the other, was, that boiling made the oatmeal
thick, and the barley meal thin; and that when
he fed with the barley meal only, it should not
be put into the copper, but mixed up with the
scalding liquor in a proper tub, or hogshead,
kept for the purpose. There are many little
things within the department of the feeder,
which, if neglected, become of serious consequence.
Nice observation should be made
upon the state of the bitches at all times; upon
the least indication of their going to heat, they
should be instantly removed; a few hours’ delay
may be the destruction of some of the best
hounds in the kennel. After their return on
a hunting day, he should ascertain whether
there are any hounds who have sustained injuries
in the feet by thorns, flints, &amp;c., in which
case a fomentation of warm pot liquor (or bran
water), followed by a washing of cold vinegar,
or salt and water, will generally effect a speedy
cure. Hounds, seriously lame, or palpably
sick, should be separated from the rest, and
placed where they can be more at ease, and
have better attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kennel, is a sporting term for the den in
which a fox deposits himself after his nocturnal
depredations, and to which he retires about
the dawn of day: being found by the hounds
in drawing covert, he is then said to be unkennelled,
and the chase begins. When safe
in some burrow, or hole, below the surface, he
is then said to lie at earth.—<i>Taplin.</i></p>

<p>THE KESTREL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The male of this species differs so much from
the female, that we have given a figure of it from
one we had in our possession, probably an old
one. Its length is fourteen inches; breadth two
feet three inches: its bill is blue; cere and eyelids
yellow; eyes black, the forehead dull yellow;
the top of the head, back part of the neck,
and sides as far as the points of the wings, are of
a lead colour, faintly streaked with black; the
cheeks are paler; from the corner of the mouth
on each side there is a dark streak pointing
downwards; the back and coverts of the wings
are of a bright vinous colour, spotted with
black; quill feathers dusky, with light edges;
all the under part of the body is of a pale rust
colour, streaked and spotted with black; thighs
plain; the tail feathers are of a fine blue grey,
with black shafts; towards the end there is a
broad black bar both on the upper part and
under sides; the tips are white: the legs are
yellow, and the claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kestrel is widely diffused throughout
Europe, and is found in the most temperate
parts of North America: it is a handsome bird;
its sight is acute, and its flight easy and graceful:
it breeds in the hollows of trees, and in
the holes of rocks, towers, and ruined buildings
it lays four or five eggs, of a pale reddish
colour: its food consists of small birds, field-mice,
and reptiles; after it has secured its prey,
it plucks the feathers very dexterously from
the birds, but swallows the mice entire and
discharges the hair, in the form of round balls
from its bill. This bird is frequently seen
hovering in the air, and fanning with its wings
by a gentle motion, or wheeling slowly round,
at the same time watching for its prey, on
which it shoots like an arrow. It was formerly
used in Great Britain for catching small birds
and young partridges.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Female Kestrel.</i>—This beautiful bird
is distinguished from every other hawk by its
variegated plumage: its bill is blue; cere and
feet yellow; eyes dark coloured, surrounded
with a yellow skin; its head is rust coloured,
streaked with black: behind each eye there is
a light spot; the back and wing coverts are
elegantly marked with numerous undulated
bars of black; the breast, belly, and thighs are
of a pale reddish colour, with dusky streaks
pointing downwards, vent plain; the tail is
marked by a pretty broad black bar near the
end; a number of smaller ones, of the same
colour, occupy the remaining part; the tip is
pale.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>This is one of our most common species,
being very generally spread throughout the
kingdom, especially in the more rocky situations
and high cliffs on our coast, where they
breed. The nest is made of a few sticks,
loosely put together, and lined with wool and
other soft materials, built in trees, in some
crevice, or projecting rocky shelf, and sometimes
they content themselves with the deserted
nest of a crow or magpie. It lays four
or five eggs of a dirty white, blotched over
with rust-colour of various shades; sometimes
wholly covered with a deep rusty red; these
are rather inferior in size to those of the
sparrow hawk.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful little animal is much smaller
than the cocker, to which he is similar in
shape and other characteristics; he has, however,
longer ears, and the tail is also longer
in proportion to the size of his body. Like
the cocker and springer, he is extremely fond
of pursuing birds of all kinds, and, like them,
too, always gives tongue in pursuit. He is
seldom used for field sports, from his diminutive
size, being easily tired, and is too short in
the legs to get through swampy ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog is found of all colours; but those
which are black, with tanned cheeks and legs,
are considered the purest breed. He gets the
name of King Charles’s dog from the extreme
liking the second monarch of that name had
for this animal, as he never went out without
being followed by eight or a dozen of them.
They were also introduced into most of the
portraits of himself and family, and particularly
in that by Vandyke. They were also his
constant companions in the palace.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use of this variety at present is as a lap-dog,
and they are consequently prized in proportion
to the diminutiveness of their size.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sense of smelling in this little spaniel
is very remarkable. The following anecdote
is related by Brown to instance it:—</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1792, a gentleman who lived in Vere
Street, Clare Market, went, with his family,
to the pit of Drury Lane theatre, at about
half-past five in the evening, leaving a small
spaniel of King Charles’s breed locked up in
the dining room, to prevent it from being
lost in his absence. At eight o’clock his son
opened the door, and the dog immediately
went to the playhouse, and found out his
master, though the pit was unusually crowded,
and its master seated near the centre.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Kingfisher</span>, <i>s.</i> A species of bird.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_304.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>King-fisher.</i> (<i>Alcedo ispida</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le
Martin-pécheur</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This splendid little
bird is rather of a clumsy shape, the head
being large in proportion to the size of the body,
and the legs and feet very small. In length
it is only seven inches, in breadth eleven; and
its weight is about two ounces and a quarter.
The bill, measured from the corners of the
mouth, is two inches long, vertically compressed
on the sides, strong, straight, and tapering to a
sharp point: the upper mandible is black,
fading into a red-colour towards the base; the
under one, as well as the inside of the mouth,
is of a reddish orange: the irides are hazel,
inclining to red. A broad stripe passes from
the bill over the eye to the hinder part of the
neck, a bright orange colour, but margined on
the side of the mouth, and crossed, below the
eye, by a narrow black stroke, and it is terminated
behind the auriculars with a slanting
wedge-shaped white spot. The throat is white;
the rest of the head and wing coverts are of a
deep shining green, spotted with bright light
blue: the scapulars and exterior webs of the
quills are of the same colour, but without spots.
The middle of the back, the rump, and the
coverts of the tail are of a most resplendent
azure: the tail, which consists of twelve short
feathers, is of a rich deep blue, and the whole
under part of the body of a bright orange. The
legs and toes are of a red-colour, and are peculiar
in their shape and conformation, the three
forward toes being unconnected from the claws
to the first joints, from whence they appear as
if grown into each other; and the inner and
hinder ones are placed in a line on the inside
of the foot, whereby the heel is widened and
seems pressed out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The suspension of this bird by a thread,
under the notion that its breast will always
turn to the north, is as fabulous as that it will
preserve woollen cloth from the moth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have once or twice,” says Mrs. Charlotte
Smith, “seen a stuffed bird of this species
hung up to the beam of a cottage ceiling,
and imagined that the beauty of the feathers
had recommended it to this sad pre-eminence,
till, on inquiry, I was assured that it served
the purpose of a weather-vane; and, though
sheltered from the immediate influence of the
wind, never failed to show every change, by
turning its beak to the quarter whence the
wind blew.” The learned, but somewhat credulous
author of the “Physicæ Curiosæ,”
says the same, upon the testimony of his own
observation. “Father Athanasius Kircher,”
he says, “had one of these birds sent him as
a present by a friend, and being disembowelled
and dried, it was suspended from the
ceiling of his celebrated museum, from 1640
to 1655, when I left Rome; and though all
the doors and windows were shut, it constantly
turned its bill towards the wind, and this I
myself observed with admiration and pleasure
almost every day for the space of three
years!!”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is difficult to conceive why ornithologists
have classed the kingfisher with land birds, as
its habits and manner of living are wholly
confined to the waters, on the margins of
which it will sit for hours together on a projecting
twig or a stone, at one while fluttering
its wings and exposing its brilliant plumage to
the sun; at another, hovering in the air, like
the kestrel, it waits the moment when it may
seize its prey, on which it darts with almost
unerring certainty: often it remains for several
seconds under the water, before it has
gained the object of its pursuit, then brings
up the little fish, which it carries to the land,
beats to death, and swallows.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female commonly makes her nest by
the sides of rivers or brooks, in a hole made
by the mole, or the water-rat: this she enlarges
or contracts to suit her purpose; and it
is conjectured, from the difficulty of finding
the nest, that frequently the hole which leads
to it is under water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kingfishers are not so numerous as might
be expected from the number of eggs found
in their nests; owing, probably, to the young
being destroyed by the floods, which must
often rise above the level of the holes where
they are bred.</p>

<p class='c006'>Except in the breeding-season, the bird is
usually seen alone, flying near the surface of
the water with the rapidity of an arrow, like
a little brilliant meteor, by which appearance
the eye is enabled to follow its long-continued
course. Considering the shortness of its wings,
the velocity with which it flies is surprising.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ornithologists inform us that kingfishers are
found in almost every part of the globe; but
it does not appear that more than this one
species has ever been seen in Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>King Duck</span>, (<i>Somateria spectabilis</i>, <span class='sc'>Fleming</span>,) <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This species is not much inferior in size to
the eider duck. The bill is almost two inches
long, of an orange-colour; at the base of
the upper mandible is a ridged protuberance,
flat on the top, and compressed on the sides,
but divided into two, the elevated parts velvety
black, passing on each side to the eyes;
the crown of the head and nape are pale ash-colour;
at the base of the upper mandible the
feathers are pea-green, passing backwards on
each side the neck, and taking in half the eye;
beneath which, and round to the chin, the
feathers are of a dirty white; but here the
two colours are blended, and the white is
lost by degrees in the green; under the chin
is a black mark, diverging like the letter V
inverted: the rest of the neck and breast are
whitish; the middle of the back, the belly,
and vent, black; wings dusky; on the middle
of the coverts is a patch of white; quills
black; the secondaries curve downwards over
the quills; the shafts deep ferruginous, on
each side the outer ones a patch of white; the
tail is cuneiform, short, and black; legs dusky;
the windpipe, according to Captain Sabine, is
precisely like that of the eider duck.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is less; the protuberance on the
bill not so large, nor so high-coloured, but
the feathery ridge on the top is broader; the
whole plumage brown, the middle of each
feather dusky; six of the lesser quills are
tipped with white, which forms a line of
white on the wing; the rest of the quills and
tail brown.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>King’s Hounds</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>His majesty’s stag-hounds pass under this
denomination, as a part of the royal establishment
continued in every successive reign
without variation. The kennel in which
they are kept is situate near the race course
upon Ascot Heath; at the distance of two
short miles from which is Swinley-lodge, the
official residence of the master of the stag-hounds,
an appointment seldom conferred but
upon one of the peerage, and is considered an
office of honour, with a salary of 2,000<i>l.</i> per
annum. The presence of the master of the
stag-hounds in the field is not a matter of necessity,
but choice, except when his majesty
hunts, and then his personal attendance is indispensable;
his badge of office is a pair of gold
dog couples, which hang suspended from a belt
on his left side. The huntsman has a handsome
residence at the kennel, with a salary of
125<i>l.</i> a year; to whom there are six assistants,
(called yeomen prickers) each having a salary
of 104<i>l.</i> with the royal livery richly ornamented,
and an annual supply of saddles,
bridles, horse-clothes, and the necessary stable
appendages; but they find their own horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hunting season commences on Holyrood
day, the 25th of September, and continues
every Tuesday and Saturday till the first
week in May; with the exception of Christmas
and Easter weeks, when they hunt three times
in each. Holyrood day and Easter Monday,
are two grand days of the year for company,
when the field is extremely numerous. His
majesty has also a pack of harriers, which are
kept at the Little Park Lodge, near Windsor,
and these he hunts constantly in Windsor
Great Park, and the surrounding neighbourhood;
they are, however, a private concern of
his majesty’s, and not included in the regular
Crown establishment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>King’s Plate</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Those called king’s-plates are a free gift from
his majesty, of 100 guineas each; and, it is
believed, were originally granted as a means of
exciting such a degree of emulation, as would
probably tend to national advantage (by an
additional influx of company) to such cities
and towns as enjoy the royal favour. Newmarket,
as the superior spot of sporting celebrity,
is particularly honoured, having two in
the first Spring, and one in the first October
meetings.</p>

<p class='c006'>King’s-plates are also given at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Guildford, Winchester, Ipswich,
Burford, Chelmsford, Nottingham, Lewes,
Edinburgh, York, Canterbury, Warwick, Lichfield,
Richmond (Yorkshire), Lincoln, Salisbury,
Ayr, Carlisle, and Ascot Heath; the
whole of which, except the last, are run for
by horses or mares of different ages, carrying
such weights as shall be appointed by the
master of the horse, or whoever he may delegate
for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The king’s-plate, of 100 guineas, given at
Ascot, and always run for on the first day,
(invariably Whit Tuesday fortnight) is only
for horses which have regularly hunted with
his majesty’s stag-hounds the preceding season,
and must have been well up with the
hounds, at their running up to, taking, or killing,
ten deer, as an indispensable qualification,
without having which they cannot be permitted
to start. At the conclusion of the
chase, when the deer is secured, those who intend
to qualify for the plate, apply to the
huntsman, and a ticket is delivered to the
rider, bearing the arms of the master of the
stag-hounds, and the seal of the royal hunt;
when which ten tickets are obtained the
horse has secured his qualification, may then
be withdrawn from the field, and is not
obliged to appear again till the day of entrance
at Sunning Hill Wells, where the tickets
must be produced, in confirmation of his
being duly qualified to start. For the accommodation
of the sporting world at large,
horses of all ages are permitted to run, carrying
the following weights:—four years’ old,
11st. 2lb.; five years’ old, 11st. 9lb.; six
years’ old, 11st. 12lb.; and aged, 12st. Mares
allowed 4lb. The best of three four-mile

<p class='c006'>The following rules are, by his majesty’s

<p class='c034'>For the better and more certain prevention
of any fraud or misapplication, the winner of

the course, a certificate signed by the steward
of the race where such plate is won, counter-signed
by himself also, which being presented
to the lord lieutenant of the county, it obtains
his signature likewise: when thus sanctioned,
it becomes payable at sight to bearer (if properly
endorsed by the winner,) at the office of
the clerk of his majesty’s stables, in the
King’s Mews, London. The lord lieutenant
of a county being out of the kingdom, the
signature of any person regularly deputed by
him is sufficient. The certificate of winning
the plate at Ascot requires only the signature
of the master of his majesty’s stag hounds,
instead of the lord lieutenant of the county.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Kite</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird of prey that infests the farms, and steals the chickens; a
fictitious bird made of paper.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_307.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This bird is easily distinguished from the
buzzard by its forked tail, which is its peculiar
and distinguishing feature. Its length is
about two feet; its bill is of a horn colour, furnished
with bristles at the base; its eyes and
cere are yellow; the feathers on the head and
neck are long and narrow, of a hoary colour,
streaked with brown down the middle of each;
those on the body are of a reddish brown colour,
the margin of each feather pale; the
quills are dark brown, the legs yellow, and
the claws black. It is common in England,
where it continues the whole year. It is
found in various parts of Europe, in very
northern latitudes, whence it retires towards
Egypt before winter, in great numbers; it is
said to breed there, and return in April to
Europe, where it breeds a second time, contrary
to the nature of rapacious birds in general.
The female lays two or three eggs of a
whitish colour, spotted with pale yellow, and
of a roundish form. Though the kite weighs
somewhat less than three pounds, the extent
of its wings is more than five feet; its flight
is rapid, and it soars very high in the air, frequently
beyond the reach of our sight; yet,
at this distance, it perceives its food distinctly,
and descends upon its prey with irresistible
force: its attacks are confined to small animals
and birds; it is particularly fond of
young chickens, but the fury of their mother
is generally sufficient to drive away the
robber.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Knee of a Horse</i> is the central joint of
the leg, where the fore thigh is united to the
shank bone. Its formation is of such strength,
that a lameness, by twist, distortion, or any
other injury, is hardly ever sustained in this
part, but by the accident of falling, which
frequently happens, and, if attended with a
blemish, very much reduces the previous value
of the horse. Prominences in a pavement,
or rolling stones upon a road, are sometimes
the occasion of such misfortunes, even to those
who are in general exceedingly sure-footed, and
of the most valuable description. Custom
has, however, introduced of late years such
an unprecedented degree of precaution in an
examination of the knees, that the slightest
touch cannot be expected to pass unnoticed
amidst so much scrutinising inspection; and
if once appearances are sufficient to justify a
doubt, the object immediately sinks in estimation,
however superior he may be in other
respects and qualifications. This being so
great a disadvantage when a horse is to be sold,
it evidently points out the absolute necessity
of a minute examination before he is bought,
as a want of it may produce considerable loss
and serious reflection. Loss of hair upon the
knees, when not too seriously affected, may
sometimes be restored by a daily application
of very strong camphorated liniment.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The knee of the horse corresponds with the
human wrist. Like the joints generally, it
should be large, by which the surface of muscular
and ligamentous contact becomes increased,
and the stability of the limb in proportion
augmented; by this form also the
tendinous insertions are further removed from
the centre of motion, and thereby their power
is increased. The knee should be carefully
examined, to see whether the skin has been
broken by falls; and great caution is necessary
in this, for the hair sometimes grows so
well over the scar as to leave it hardly discernible.
Horse dealers likewise hide the
blemish by blackening the part. It does not,
however, follow that a mark or scar always
indicates a stumbler; and persons are too apt
to forget that the safest horse may by an unavoidable
accident fall; but which circumstance
will never influence his future manner
of going, unless the cicatrix should be of such
extent as to interfere with the motion of the
joint; if, therefore, the arm and fore-arm be
strong, the fore-hand high, and the horse show
good action, he should not be rejected wholly
for an accidental blemish.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>These birds, like others of the same genus,
differ considerably from each other in their
appearance in different seasons of the year, as
well as from age and sex. The specimen from
which the above drawing was taken measured
from the point of the bill to the tip of the
tail eight inches and a half; the extended
wings about fifteen; and it weighed two ounces
eight drachms. The bill is one inch and
three-eighths long, black at the tip, and dusky,
fading into orange towards the base; tongue
of nearly the same length, sharp, and horny
at the point: sides of the head, neck, and
breast, cinereous, edged with ash-coloured
grey; the chin white, and a stroke of the
same colour passed over each eye. All the
upper parts of the plumage were darkish-brown,
but more deep and glossy on the crown
of the head, back, and scapulars, and each
feather was edged with ash or grey; the under
parts were a cream-coloured white, streaked
or spotted with brown on the sides and vent;
the greater coverts of the wings tipped with
white, which formed a bar across them when
extended; the legs reddish yellow and short,
not measuring more than two inches and one-eighth
from the middle toe nail to the knee;
the thighs feathered very nearly to the knee;
toes divided without any connecting membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is caught in Lincolnshire and the
other fenny counties in great numbers by nets,
into which it is decoyed by carved wooden
figures painted to represent itself, and placed
within them, much in the same way as the

by many equal to the ruff in the delicacy of
the flavour. The season for taking it is from
August to November, after which the frost
compels it to disappear.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lameness in Horses.</i>—Proceeds from a
variety of causes, and requires much patient
investigation to ascertain, to a certainty, the
exact seat of injury; for want of which judicious
precaution, mischief frequently follows.
Horses are sometimes persecuted, blistered,
and fired for a lameness in one part, which
ultimately proves to be in another, and this
alone sufficiently points out the absolute necessity
of a deliberate discrimination. As lameness
proceeds from different causes, so it is of
different kinds, and requires various modes of
treatment, equally opposite to each other.
This cannot be more forcibly elucidated, than
by adverting to the difference between a lameness
originating in a relaxation of the sinews,
and a ligamentary injury sustained by a sudden
turn, twist, or distortion, of some particular
joint. These require a very different mode of
treatment; and yet it is too much, and too
unthinkingly the custom to treat every kind
of lameness in the same way. From either a
want of patience in the owner, or a want of
prudence in the practitioner, the favourite operation
of blistering is thought applicable to
every case without exception; and being often
resorted to before the inflammation of the part
has sufficiently subsided, occasions a permanent
enlargement, with a thickening of the integument,
and consequent stiffness, rendering
the remedy equally injurious with the original
defect.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all lamenesses occasioned by a relaxation
of the tendons, blistering, and even firing, are
admitted to have a forcible effect, provided
they are brought into use at a proper time;
but not before the inflammation (which is generally
attendant upon such case) has previously
subsided. In all ligamentary injuries
blistering is seldom, if ever, known to be productive
of permanent advantage; and is, perhaps,
upon most occasions, so immediately
adopted, because a single application is of so
much less personal trouble, than a daily persevering
hour bestowed in a hot fomentation,
and stimulative embrocations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the subject of lameness in general, it
is necessary to remark, that injuries sustained
in tendons (commonly called the back sinews)
are more frequently relieved, and a lasting
cure obtained, than in a lameness of the joints;
where, after patient and persevering medical
applications, and a corresponding portion of
rest, a renewal of work has almost immediately
produced a relapse.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Lameness, from whatever cause arising, is
unsoundness. However temporary it may
be, or however obscure, it lessens the utility
of the horse, and renders him unsound for
the time. How far his soundness may be
afterwards affected, must depend on the circumstances
of the case. A lame horse is for
a time an unsound one.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Lameness in Dogs.</i>—During the hunting
or shooting season, dogs are very liable to sore
feet: they should be frequently washed with
strong brine, pot liquor, or salt and vinegar,—a
handful of the former to a pint of the latter.
But as it will be found easier to prevent than
cure the affection, this is best done by washing
their feet every day, when returning from
the field, with pot-liquor or brine.—<i>The

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lampass</span>, <i>s.</i> A lump of flesh, about the bigness of a nut, in the roof of a

<p class='c006'><i>Lampass.</i>—Called also lampers, and lampards,
is a spongy, elastic enlargement of the
roof of a young horse’s mouth, just behind the
nippers of his upper jaw, which frequently acquires
such a luxuriance in growth, as to be
equal with, or to exceed, the surface of the
teeth, and is supposed to occasion pain to
such horses in the mastication of their corn.
Whenever the lampass are found so protuberant
as to justify an opinion, or produce a proof
that they occasion pain in mastication, it is
then time enough to pass the point or edge of
a sharp penknife, or lancet, transversely and
longitudinally over the puffy and prominent
part, so as to let it bleed in that state for a few
minutes; then let it be washed with a solution
of alum in water, and no further inconvenience
need be apprehended.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lamprey</span>, <i>s.</i> A kind of eel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sight of a large square slab of white
marble at a trifling distance from the main road
on this mountain, excited my curiosity some
days ago. It contained a modern Latin inscription
of great length, which for its singularity
I would send you, but I wish to save
postage. The traveller is desired to pause,
in order to behold an ocular demonstration of
the cruelty and impiety of the ancient pagans,
exhibited in the fish-ponds of A. Pollio, Esq.
who, says the marble, was particularly fond of
lampreys fed with <i>human blood</i>; and who to
gratify this inhuman sort of gluttony, had
these ponds built at an immense expense, and
caused the wretched victims of his corrupt
palate to be thrown into them. Accepting the
pious invitation, I entered the farm pointed out
by the inscription, and actually found the farm-house
to consist of some modern masonry engrafted
upon a solid stock of ancient reticulated
architecture. At the back of the building
a small door opened into the ponds, which
even now appeared to be abundantly supplied
with water, rising to the height of about eight
or ten feet, from the door downwards, and covered
by an arched vault nearly as high from
the top of the door: the sides were lined with
a stucco, as hard, if not harder than stone.
The whole fabric was in perfect preservation,
and well worth the attention of an antiquary;
but my conductor was unable to add anything
to the information given by the inscription,
which, I confess, appeared to me very problematical.
The neat and impenetrable covering
of stucco, would rather induce me to take it
for a reservoir, or large cistern for water, than
a pond for lampreys: and supposing it to have
been the latter, where is the evidence of human
bodies having supplied their food; and supposing
the Roman laws to have been lax enough
to allow such a diabolical practice, what stomach
could relish such a dainty?—<i>Letters

<p>THE LAND-RAIL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Length rather more than nine inches; the
bill is light brown; the eyes hazel; all the
feathers on the upper parts of the plumage are
of a dark brown, edged with pale rust colour;
both wing coverts and quills are of a deep
chestnut; the fore part of the neck and the
breast are of a pale ash colour; a streak of
the same colour extends over each eye from
the bill to the side of the neck; the belly is of
a yellowish white; the sides, thighs, and vent,
are marked with faint rusty coloured bars;
the legs are of a pale flesh colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have ventured to remove this bird from
the usual place assigned to it among those to
whom it seems to have little or no analogy,
and have placed it among others to which in
most respects it bears a strong affinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>It makes its appearance about the same time
as the quail, and frequents the same places,
whence it is called in some counties the king
of the quails. Its well known cry is first
heard as soon as the grass becomes long enough
to shelter it, and continues till the grass is
cut; but the bird is seldom seen, for it constantly
skulks among the thickest part of the
herbage, and runs so nimbly through it, winding
and doubling in every direction, that it is
difficult to come near it; when hard pushed
by the dog, it sometimes stops short and
squats down, by which means its too eager
pursuer overshoots the spot, and loses the
trace. It seldom springs but when driven to
extremity, and generally flies with its legs
hanging down, but never to a great distance;
as soon as it alights it runs off, and before the
fowler has reached the spot, the bird is at a
considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The corncrake leaves the island before the
winter, and repairs to other countries in search
of its food, which consists principally of slugs,
of which it destroys prodigious numbers; it
likewise feeds on worms and insects, as well
as on seeds of various kinds. It is very common
in Ireland, and is seen in great numbers
in the Island of Anglesea on its passage to that
country. On its first arrival in England, it
is so lean as to weigh less than six ounces,
from which one would conclude that it must
have come from distant parts; before its departure,
however, it has been known to exceed
eight ounces, and is then very delicious eating.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female lays ten or twelve eggs on a
nest made of a little moss or dry grass, carelessly
put together; they are of a pale ash-colour,
marked with rust-coloured spots. The
young crakes are covered with black down;
they soon find the use of their legs, for they
follow the mother immediately after they have
burst the shell.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>This is deemed a bird of passage by all
the writers: yet from its formation seems to
be poorly qualified for migration; for its wings
are short, and placed so forward, and out of
the centre of gravity, that it flies in a very
heavy and embarrassed manner, with its legs
hanging down; and can hardly be sprung a
second time, as it runs very fast, and seems
to depend more on the swiftness of its feet
than on its flying.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we came to draw it, we found the
entrails so soft and tender, that in appearance
they might have been dressed like the ropes
of a woodcock. The craw or crop was small
and lank, containing a mucus; the gizzard
thick and strong, and filled with small shell
snails, some whole, and many ground to
pieces through the attrition which is occasioned
by the muscular force and motion of that
intestine. We saw no gravels among the
food: perhaps the shell snails might perform
the function of gravels or pebbles, and might
grind one another.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>That it is a bird of passage there can be
little doubt, though one would think it
poorly qualified for migration, on account of
the wings being short, and not placed in the
exact centre of gravity: how that may be I
cannot say, but I know that its heavy sluggish
flight is not owing to its inability of
flying faster, for I have seen it fly very swiftly,
although in general its actions are sluggish.
Its unwillingness to rise proceeds, I imagine,
from its sluggish disposition, and its great
timidity, for it will sometimes squat so close
to the ground as to suffer itself to be taken
up by the hand, rather than rise; and yet
it will at times run very fast.</p>

<p class='c006'>What Mr. White remarks respecting the
small shell snails found in its gizzard, confirms
my opinion, that it frequents corn fields,
seed clover, and brakes or fern, more for the
sake of snails, slugs, and other insects which
abound in such places, than for the grain or
seeds; and that it is entirely an insectivorous
bird.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>White’s Selborne</i>—<i>Wood.</i></p>

shuffling the cards, and having them cut by
any other person of the party; after which he
deals out two cards on his left hand, turning
them up; then one for himself and a fourth,
which he places in the middle of the table for
the company, called the <i>rejouissance</i> card.
Upon this card any, or all of the company,
except the dealer, may put their money, either
a limited or unlimited sum, as may be agreed
on, which the dealer is obliged to answer, by
staking a sum equal to the whole that is put
upon it by different persons. He continues
dealing, and turning the cards upwards, one
by one, till two of a sort appear; for instance
two aces, two deuces, &amp;c., which, in order to
separate, and that no person may mistake for
single cards, he places on each side of his own
card; and as often as two, three, or the fourth
card of a sort come up, he always places them
in the same manner, on each side of his own.
Any single card the company has a right to
take and put money upon, unless the dealer’s
own card happens to be double, which often
occurs by this card being the same as one of
the two cards which he first of all dealt out on
his left-hand. Thus he continues dealing till
he brings either their cards, or his own. As
long as his own card remains undrawn he wins;
and whichever card comes up first loses. If
he draw or deal out the two cards on his left,
which are called the hand-cards, before his
own, he is entitled to deal again; the advantage
of which is merely his being exempted
from losing when he draws a similar card to
his own immediately after he has turned up
one for himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>This game is often played more simply
without the <i>rejouissance</i> card, giving every
person round the table a card to put money
upon. Sometimes it is played by dealing only
two cards, one for the dealer and another for
the company.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This bird is about the size of a pigeon. Its
bill is black; eyes large and hazel; the top of
the head is black, glossed with green; a tuft
of long, narrow feathers issues from the back
part of the head, and turns upwards at the
end; some of them are four inches in length;
the sides of the head and neck are white,
which is interrupted with a blackish streak
above and below the eye; and the back part
of the neck is a very pale brown; the forepart,
as far as the breast, is black; the back
and the wing coverts are of a dark green,
glossed with purple and blue reflections; the
quills are black, the first four tipped with
white; the breast and belly are of a pure
white; the upper-tail coverts and vent pale
chestnut; the tail is white at the base, and
the rest of it is black, with pale tips; the
outer feathers almost wholly white, the legs
are red; claws black; hind-claw very short.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is a constant inhabitant of this
country; but as it subsists chiefly on worms,
it is forced to change its place in quest of
food, and is frequently seen in great numbers
by the sea-shore, where it finds an abundant
supply. It is everywhere well known by its
loud and incessant cries, which it repeats
without intermission whilst on the wing, and
from which, in most languages, a name has
been given it, imitative of the sound. The
peewit is a lively, active bird, almost continually
in motion; it sports and frolics in the air
in all directions, and assumes a variety of attitudes;
it remains long upon the wing, and
sometimes rises to a considerable height; it
runs along the ground very nimbly, and
springs and bounds from spot to spot with
great agility. The female lays four eggs of a
dirty olive, spotted with black: she makes no
nest, but deposits them upon a little dry
grass hastily scraped together: the young birds
run very soon after they are hatched: during
this period the old ones are very assiduous in
their attention to their charge; on the approach
of any person to the place of their deposit
they flutter round his head with cries of
the greatest inquietude, which increase as he
draws nearer to the spot where the brood are
squatted; in case of extremity, and as a last
resource, they run along the ground as if
lame, in order to draw off the attention of
the fowler from any farther pursuit. The
young lapwings are first covered with a blackish
down, interspersed with long white hairs,
which they gradually lose, and about the latter
end of July, they acquire their beautiful
plumage. At this time they assemble in
flocks, which hover in the air, saunter in the
meadows, and after rain disperse among the
ploughed fields. In October the lapwings are
very fat, and are then said to be excellent
eating. Their eggs are considered as a great
delicacy, and are sold in London at three shillings
a dozen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following anecdote communicated by
the late Rev. J. Carlyle, is worthy of notice,
as it shows the domestic nature of this bird,
as well as the art with which it conciliates the
regard of animals differing from itself in nature,
and generally considered as hostile to
every species of the feathered tribe. Two of
these birds, given to Mr. Carlyle, were put into
a garden, where one of them soon died; the
other continued to pick up such food as the
place afforded, till winter deprived it of its
usual supply: necessity soon compelled it to
draw nearer the house, by which it gradually
became familiarised to occasional interruptions
from the family. At length one of the servants,
when she had occasion to go into the
back-kitchen with a light, observed that the
lapwing always uttered his cry ‘pee wit’ to obtain
admittance. He soon grew more familiar;
as the winter advanced he approached as far
as the kitchen, but with much caution, as that
part of the house was generally occupied by a
dog and a cat, whose friendship the lapwing at
length conciliated so entirely, that it was his
regular custom to resort to the fireside as soon
as it drew dark, and spend the evening and
night with his two associates, sitting close by
them, and partaking of the comfort of a warm
fireside. As soon as spring appeared, he left
off coming to the house, and betook himself
to the garden; but on the approach of winter
he had recourse to his old shelter and his old
friends, who received him very cordially. Security
was productive of insolence; what was
at first obtained with caution, was afterwards
taken without reserve: he frequently amused
himself with washing in the bowl which was
set for the dog to drink out of, and while he
was thus employed, he showed marks of the
greatest indignation if either of his companions
presumed to interrupt him. He died in the
asylum he had chosen, being choked with
something he had picked up from the floor.
During his confinement, crumbs of wheaten
bread were his principal food, which he preferred
to any thing else.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the peculiar construction of the hinder
claws, which are very long and straight, larks
generally rest upon the ground; those which
frequent trees perch only on the larger branches.
They all build their nests upon the ground,
which exposes them to the depredations of the
smaller kinds of voracious animals, such as
the weasel, stoat, &amp;c., which destroy great numbers
of them. The cuckoo, likewise, which
makes no nest of its own, frequently substitutes
its eggs in the place of theirs. The general
characters of this species are thus described:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The bill is straight and slender, bending a
little towards the end, which is sharp pointed;
the nostrils are covered with feathers and bristles:
the tongue is cloven at the end; tail
somewhat forked; the toes divided to the origin;
claw of the hinder toe very long, and almost
straight; the fore claws very short, and
slightly curved.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Twirling for larks</i> is a species of amusement
peculiar to the French, and is thus described:—</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are attracted to any given spot
in great numbers, by a singular contrivance,
called a mirror.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a small machine, made of a piece
of mahogany, shaped like a chapeau bras, and
highly polished, or else it is made of common
wood, inlaid with small bits of looking-glass,
so as to reflect the sun’s rays upwards; it is
fixed on the top of a thin iron rod, on an upright
spindle, dropped through an iron loop, or
ring, attached to a piece of wood to drive into
the ground. By pulling a string, fastened to the
spindle, the mirror twirls, and the reflected
light unaccountably attracts the larks, who
hover over it, and become a mark for the
sportsman. In this way, says an old sportsman,
I have had capital sport. A friend of
mine actually shot six dozen before breakfast;
while he sat on the ground he pulled the
twirler himself, and his dogs fetched the
birds as they dropped. However, I go on in
the common way, and employ a boy to work
the twirler. Ladies often partake of the
amusement, on a cold dry morning, not by
shooting, but by watching the sport: so many
as ten or a dozen parties are sometimes out together,
firing at a distance of five or six hundred
yards, and in this way the larks are constantly
kept on the wing. The most favourable
mornings are when there is a gentle light frost,
with little or no wind, and a clear sky; for
when there are clouds, the larks will not approach.
One would think the birds themselves
enjoyed their destruction, for the fascination of
the twirler is so strong, as to rob them of the
usual fruits of experience; after being fired at
several times, they return to the twirler, and
form again into groups, above it; some of
them even fly down, and settle upon the
ground within a yard or two of the astonishing
instrument, looking at it this way and
that way, and all ways together, as if nothing
had happened.—<i>Sporting Anecdotes.</i>—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Length fifteen, breadth thirty-seven inches;

black; the second tipped with black, and

In winter the head is white, with a black patch
on the ear, and another in front of the eyes;
under the wing blackish grey. Female similar.
Nest, according to Wilson, in meadows
and islands in fresh water lakes. Eggs three,
olive, with dusky blotches. It leaves Scotland
in winter, but is a permanent resident in
England.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds appear to be subject to great
variety, either from age or from change of
season, and in those changes they have been
described as different species. The red-legged
gull of authors is only this bird before it is
arrived at maturity; and there seems no doubt
but the old birds lose the black on the head
in the winter, and do not assume it again till
the breeding season; but there is generally a
little black about the ears; the bill and legs
also lose their bright colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen hundreds of these birds together
in the winter, but have never seen one
with a black head at that season. They appear
in great abundance in the autumn, on the
coast of Caermarthen and Glamorganshire,
particularly about the mouths of rivers. At
that time the head is white, in some mottled
with brown, with a dusky spot behind the
ear; the back and wing coverts in young
birds are mottled with brown and white; the
tail crossed with a dusky bar at the end; the
bill and legs scarcely tinged with red. Towards
spring the back begins to assume the ash-colour;
then the wing coverts, and the bill and
legs, obtain their proper colour; the black
behind the ears spreads and meets behind,
and on lifting up the feathers of the crown
about the month of March, the stubs of the
black feathers are to be observed. At this
time also some few black feathers appear on
the throat; but the perfect black head is not
assumed during their stay in those parts. In
Devonshire we have seen them complete in
feather later in the spring, but never remember
to have observed the same appearance in
winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laughing gull is said to breed in Lincolnshire
in the fens, and in other parts of
England, upon the borders of rivers.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Dr. Plott assures us, in his History of Staffordshire,
that in his time these birds annually
visited a pool in Staffordshire. He also assures
us that they would not breed on any other
land than that of the proprietor of the before-mentioned
place; and that on the death of
the owner, they deserted the pool for three
years, but only retired to another estate belonging
to the next heir.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young birds were accounted good eating,
and were taken by driving them into nets
before they could fly; that fifty dozen were
taken at a driving, and that five shillings per
dozen was the usual price.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young were kept alive and fattened on
offal. It is also added that three drivings
were generally made in a season; and that
anciently as many were taken as produced a
profit of fifty or sixty pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>No author mentions their being seen in
winter, having at that time been made a distinct
species under various denominations.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Lavaret is a fish known in England by the
name of shelley or fresh water herring, in
Wales by that of gwinniad; in Ireland by that
of pollan; and in Scotland by that of vangis.
In colour it is most like a grayling, but with
broader and larger scales; it is common in
the large lakes of most Alpine countries, and
is known at Geneva by the name of ferra;
and I believe that the salmo ceruleus, or
wartmann of Bloch, or the gang-fisch of the
Lake of Constance, from a comparison that I
made of it with the ferra, is a variety of the
same fish. It sometimes is as large as two
pounds, and when quite fresh, and well fried
or boiled, is an exceedingly good fish, and
carves like grayling. The lavaret of different
lakes has appeared to me to vary in the number
of the spines in the fins. One brought
me from the Lake of Zurich, thirteen inches
long and eight inches in girth, had twelve
spines in the dorsal fin, fifteen in the pectoral
fins, eleven in the ventral, thirteen in the
anal, and eighteen in the caudal. The gang-fisch,
from the Lake of Constance, which was
of a bluer colour, but I think decidedly
only a variety of the same fish, was seven
inches and three-quarters long, and four in
girth, had twelve spines in the dorsal fin, fifteen
in the pectoral, eleven in the ventral,
twelve in the anal, and eighteen in the caudal.
A lavaret from the Traun See had twelve
spines in the dorsal fin, seventeen in the pectoral,
thirteen in the ventral fin, twelve in
the anal fin, and twenty-four in the caudal
fin. One from the Hallstadt See was a larger
and broader fish, but did not differ from the
lavaret of the Traun See, except in having
two spines less in the tail. It is only taken
with nets. It feeds on vegetables, and in the
stomachs of those I have opened I have never
found either flies or small fishes.—<i>Salmonia.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The part of the limb between the knee

shank-bone is rounded in front, and flattened,

of the long bones, as well as the most superficially
situated, for in some parts it is covered
only by the skin. The upper head is flat,
with slight depressions corresponding with the
lower row of the bones of the knee. The
lower head is differently and curiously formed.
It resembles a double pulley. There are
three elevations, the principal one in the centre,
and one on each side; and between them
are two slight grooves; and these so precisely
correspond with deep depressions and slight
prominences in the upper head of the larger
pastern, and are so enclosed and guarded by
the elevated edges of that bone, that when
the shank-bone and the pastern are fitted to
each other, they form a perfect hinge: they
admit of the bending and extension of the
limb, but of no lateral or side motion; which
is a circumstance of very great importance in
a joint so situated, and having the whole
weight of the horse thrown upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smaller bones are placed behind the
larger on either side; a slight projection only
of the head of each can be seen in front. The
heads of these bones are enlarged, and receive
part of the weight conveyed by the lower
row of the bones of the knee. They are
united to the larger bone by the same kind of
substance which is found in the colt between
the bone of the elbow and the main bone of
the arm; and which is designed, like that,
by its great elasticity, to lessen the concussion
or jar when the weight of the animal is thrown
on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most easy method of making hair into
lines is, by a small engine, which is sold at
most of the fishing-tackle shops. It consists
of a large horizontal wheel, and three very
small ones, inclosed in a brass box, about a
quarter of an inch thick, and two inches in
diameter; the axis of each of the small wheels
is continued through the under side of the
box, and is formed into a hook; by means of
a strong screw, it may be fixed on any post
or partition, and is set in motion by a small
winch in the centre of the box; the process is
soon acquired, and it is thus used:—Take as
many hairs as you purpose the line shall contain,
and divide them into three parts; each
of these is to be tied to a piece of fine twine
doubled, and fixed to the hooks which depend
from the machine; then take the piece of
lead which has a hook at its top, and after
tying the three parcels of hair together at the
loose end, hang the weight thereon: after
this, cut three grooves in the inside of a cork
at equal distances, and in each groove place a
division of the hairs, that, by gently turning
the engine, the links may turn with a greater
evenness to the lead. As the links grow
tighter, move the cork slowly upwards, and
when the whole is sufficiently twisted, take
out the cork and tie the link into a knot, and
so proceed till the quantity of links wanted
for a line are completed; observing to lessen
the number of hairs in each link in such
proportion as that the line may be taper.
The links should then be laid for an hour
into cold water; some persons, whether a
hair starts or not, retwist them before they
are made into a line, and more particularly
when there is an odd hair in the number
twisted. Some put the hair for ten minutes
into warm water before working it into links.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making lines, every hair in every link
should be equally big, round and even, that
the strength may be so proportionate that
they will not break singly, but altogether:
by carefully choosing the hairs, they will
stretch and bear a much stronger force than
when a faulty hair is included. Never
strain the hair before twisting; the best will
easily be selected by the eye, and two or
three inches of the bottom part of the hair
should be cut off, as it is generally defective.
The links should be twisted very slowly, and
not lie harsh, but so as to twine one with another,
and no more, for a hard twisted line is
always weak: by mixing chestnut, black, or any
other coloured hair, the line may be varied at
pleasure.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Lines of silk or hemp may be coloured by
a strong decoction of oak bark, which it is
believed resists the water, and adds to their
durability: any shade of an excellent russet
brown may be obtained according to the time
they remain in the decoction, which should
be used cold.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In leading of lines great care is needful to
balance the floats so nicely that a very small
touch will sink them. Some use for this purpose
lead shaped like a barleycorn, but shot
is better; and for fine fishing have a number
of small in preference to a few large shot on
the line; the lowest of either ought to be
nine or ten inches from the hook.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Linnet</span> (<i>Linaria linota</i>, <span class='sc'>Cuvier</span>), <i>s.</i> A small singing bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is subject to much variety
with respect to the red markings which, at
certain ages and seasons, are found upon the
head and breast, and this has occasioned it to
be multiplied into two distinct species by
various ornithologists, all of whom seem to
agree that the general colour of both are alike,
but assert that the greater redpole has none
of this colour upon the breast. On comparing
the various authors who have given
this as a distinct species, we find they all
make it nearly the same as the redpole, but
not quite so rufous on the upper parts. The
principal distinction seems to be in the breast
being of a fine crimson colour, and none of
that colour on the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>The male in full plumage has the bill
bluish; irides hazel; the head light brown;
the feathers on the crown darkest in their
middle; sides of the neck inclining to ash-colour;
the forehead rosy red; the back, scapulars,
and coverts of the wings, fine deep
rufous brown, lightest on the rump, and palest
on the margin of each feather; the breast is
brown, with more or less spots like that on
the head; belly light rufous brown; vent
almost white; quill-feathers dusky black,
with more or less white on the exterior and
interior webs, which forms a conspicuous bar
of that colour on the wing; the tail is forked,
the feathers, like those of the quills, black,
margined with white, which colour predominates
on the inner webs; coverts of the
tail black, edged with grey; legs brown. The
weight of the male is about five drachms, that
of the other sex rather less. The plumage
of the female is more dusky brown; the
coverts of the wings rufous-brown; sides of
the throat plain dirty white, the middle part
streaked; breast and sides pale brown, with
dusky streaks; quills and tail like the other
sex, but the former not so deeply margined
with white, and of course no perceptible bar
on the wing.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds fly in flocks during winter, at
which time the males have little or none of
the red markings which, on the return of
spring, they put forth.</p>

<p class='c006'>This linnet is very common throughout
Britain, extending as far as the Orkneys,
where it is abundant. During the summer
it resorts to waste land and commons, in the
upper parts of the country, where it breeds.
Furzy commons seem to be the favourite
resorts of these birds during that season; the
bushy furze being admirably adapted to conceal
the nest from the prying eye, and sometimes
a quickset or gooseberry-bush answers
the purpose. The nest is composed of moss
woven with wool, and lined with wool and
hair, very neatly put together; the eggs are
four in number, of a bluish white, with a few
purplish specks and short lines; their weight
from twenty-four to thirty grains. In the
month of April they pair, and commence
building their nest, and in May the first
broods are hatched; but if the nest should
be destroyed, they will build another as late
as the month of August, appearing dissatisfied
until the object of their visit is accomplished.
During the time of nidification, and until the
young are hatched, the song of the linnet,
although short, possesses much sweetness.
At once brilliant and soft, the song of the
linnet consists of many irregular notes, tastefully
put together in a clear and sonorous
tone, which continues during the whole year,
except at the moulting season. Besides its
own natural note, it will soon acquire the
notes of other birds, particularly the nightingale;
and may be taught in a very short time
to imitate any of our tunes, if they are whistled
to it. After describing the mature bird,
Bechstein says, “a male of three years old is
distinguished in the spring, by the name of the
red linnet (<i>Linotte Sanguine</i>); the forehead is
then of a bright blood-red colour; the remainder
of the head being of a reddish ash-colour;
the top a little speckled with black.
After the moulting in autumn, we no longer
see the red upon the forehead, that colour
being hid by the white feathers; the coverts
of the breast then assume a deep brown-colour,
and blackish spots begin to appear;
the interior feathers on the breast, which
were formerly red, are now of a brownish
grey, mixed with red. In this plumage it is
known by the name of the grey linnet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After the time of its second moulting, if
we part the reddish grey feathers on the forehead
and breast, we find that they are still
red at the tips, and only hid by the yellowish
white borders of the new feathers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In this state it is the rock or mountain
linnet (<i>Linotte de Roche</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have even,” he adds, “had these birds
with the forehead and breast of a rich reddish
yellow.” To this variety bird catchers give
the name of the yellow linnet. These varieties
of plumage do not occur with the
female, which is besides considerably smaller.
In addition to these, there are many changes
produced by season and age; for instance, as
the bird increases in age, the red colour on
the head increases also.—<i>Bechstein</i>—<i>Selby</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Linseed</span>, <i>s.</i> The seed of flax.</p>

<p class='c006'>Linseed, or flax-seed, abounds with oil and
mucilage, and is useful in the composition of
those emollient drinks given in inflammations
of the bladder and bowels, or complaints of
the urinary passages. A strong mucilaginous
drink may be made without bruising the
seeds, either by decoction or infusion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Linseed Cake</i> is that part of the linseed
which remains after the oil has been pressed
out. It is employed to fatten cattle, and is
given, occasionally, to horses. When ground
it is sold as linseed meal and linseed powder,
and often used in the composition of poultices.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Linseed Oil</i> is sometimes employed as a
laxative, and, though very inferior to castor,
and even olive oil, may be occasionally substituted
for it, on account of its being much
less expensive. It is used in making pectoral
emulsions, liniments, and ointments; but
even for these purposes olive oil is preferable,
on account of the drying quality of linseed
oil.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_322.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This little fish is found in small brooks
among the gravel, or where there is a soil of
mud and gravel together, with weeds, and in
several of our rivers by the sides of sharp
streams; it seldom rises to the top of the
water, keeping at the bottom on the gravel,
upon which it feeds, and is, on that account,
in some places, called the groundling; it is
frequent in the stream near Amesbury, in
Wiltshire, where, out of frolic, the sportsmen
swallow it down alive, in a glass of white
wine.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a slimy fish without scales, and of
rather a long make; the mouth is small,
placed beneath, and has no teeth; it is bearded
like the gudgeon and the barbel, having on
the upper mandible six small beards, one at
each corner of the mouth, and four at the end
of the nose; the body is smooth and slippery,
and almost of the same thickness; the colour
of the head, back, and sides, is in some white,
in others of a dirty yellow, very elegantly
marked with large spots, consisting of numberless
minute black specks; the pectoral,
dorsal, and caudal fins are also spotted; the
belly and ventral fins of a pure white; the
tail broad, and rather rounded. One of the
largest ever heard of by Mr. Pennant, was
four inches and three quarters in length, but
they seldom exceed three inches. The flesh
of the loach is singularly nutritious, and from
that circumstance, and its being equally grateful
to the palate, it is recommended to the
sick. The females, during summer, are generally
full of spawn; these fish are to be taken
with a very small red worm, the bait touching
the ground. The loach is used as a bait
for other fish, and for eels perhaps it is the
best.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Load</span>, <i>s.</i> The leading vein in a mine; the charge of a gun.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Loading.</i>—Much as may be said on this
important head, I shall attempt to explain it
by one simple example: for instance, to load
a single gun of six, or double gun of seven,
eight, or nine pounds’ weight, take a steel
charger, which holds precisely an ounce and
a half of shot; fill it brimful of powder, from
which first prime, and then put the remainder
into the barrel; to this add the same measure
bumperful of shot, and then regulate the tops
of your flasks and belts accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some little difference of charge will, of
course, be required between a twenty-two and
a fourteen gauge; and, in this, we may be
guided by the shoulder, observing, at the same
time, the proportion of each here recommended:
but, unless the gun is very heavy,
a gauge of fourteen will recoil more than one
of twenty-two; so that, after all, the above
charge might do equally well for both.</p>

<p class='c006'>For those who have scales at hand, another
way will be to ascertain this by weight; for
instance, to the guns above mentioned, put
one drachm and a half of powder, exclusive
of priming, to an ounce and a half of shot.
The proportion for a twelve pounds’ gun to be
doubled; eighteen pounds’ trebled; twenty-four
pounds’ quadrupled, &amp;c. with one trifling
deviation; viz.—the larger the gun the less
should be the proportion of shot, as the larger
and longer the calibre the more powder may
be damaged in going down it.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lob</span>, <i>s.</i> Any one clumsy, or sluggish; a large worm.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dissect a gun-lock.</i>—Place the lock
on full cock, screw on the cramp, let
down the cock, and the main-spring will
fall off; replacing it when necessary, by letting
down the cock, hooking the spring, full
cocking, and then removing the cramp. I
need not detail the mode of taking to pieces
the whole of the lock; but I may remind
you, that, in separating the cock from the
tumbler, the turnscrew should on no account
be placed between the cock and the lock-plate,
but a small blow should be struck on
the end of the tumbler, which may protrude
through the cock, or, if level with it, the end
of a turnscrew may be placed upon it, and the
other end struck as a punch; while the plate
of the lock itself, disencumbered of course
of all the other movements, is held in the
palm of the left hand, the turnscrew being
held in its place by the finger and thumb of
the same hand. In inserting the scear, it is
well to remember that this is to be done
after re-fixing the feather spring, by hooking
the end in the tumbler before the re-adjustment
of the mainspring, and pressing back
the other end by force till the screw is put in
its place. This, I confess, is somewhat more
difficult than half securing the bridle, and
putting on the feather spring last by pushing
it into its place when the screw is through it,
though not tight; but I like the first-mentioned
of these ways the best. Let me recommend
you to clarify the oil you use for
the purpose of lubricating the locks, by filling
the bottle with shot, drawing off the clear oil,
and repeating the process again and again at
your leisure. See here is some I have had eleven
years, and you will observe it is free from
that cloudy deposit which oil not thus or otherwise
clarified contains, and which is apt to leave
a black stain behind it. But we are to be up
early—so good night.—<i>Hints to Sportsmen.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lockjaw</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Castration, nicking, docking, punctures,
particularly of the feet; lacerations, and even
contusions, will bring it on. I have seen it
follow a fall, which presented nothing more
than a moderate contusion in the shoulder. In
America, it is not an unfrequent result of castration;
and in some tropical climates compression
of the cord in the operation must
always be avoided, so apt is any irritation to
produce it in these regions. It is considered
as most apt to follow wounds of tendinous and
ligamentous parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>It commences usually by a certain stiffness
about the throat, and difficulty in swallowing,
or in turning the head, which soon extends
itself to the jaws, and occasions a contracted
state of the mouth, with the usual inclination
to masticate, but painfully and imperfectly
performed. As this increases, the jaws can
hardly be separated at all, when farriers say
the horse is ‘jaw set.’ By the tetanic action
of the retractor muscle, the haw is drawn
partly over the globe, at the same time that
the tension of the other ocular muscles gives
the eyes a vivid appearance and retroverted
aspect, which ill accords with the more placid
effect of a protruded haw. As the disease extends
over the voluntary muscles of the trunk
and extremities, the appearances are distressing
in the extreme. The head is raised, the
ears pointed forwards, the nostrils dilated, and
the nose is carried out. The legs straddle
wide, the tail is cocked, and quivers with the
constant fatigue of the levator muscles; and
the abdominal muscles are drawn tight over
the belly, giving to the horse an appearance of
having just completed some extraordinary exertion.
The complaint presents a few moments
of relaxation sometimes, from the extreme
and powerful contractions of the over-strained
muscles; while profuse sweats mark
the distress and exertions of convulsion. The
circulation is, in most instances, at first not
much affected; but as the disease increases,
the pulse quickens, and becomes tremulous
and irregular. The respiration also gradually
becomes hurried and irregular; costiveness is
usually present, and the urine is sparingly
made. In this state the suffering animal may
remain from six to ten days, when, worn out
by inanition and irritation, he often falls lifeless,
or expires after a short state of convulsion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general curative practice in tetanic
cases among veterinarians, foreign and English,
of the present day, leans to the free use
of the lancet, to complete opening of the
bowels, and to a liberal administration of
opiates, as being every one of them powerful
antispasmodics singly, but in this painful affection
proving doubly so conjointly; to which
are added, blistering the spine; and the beneficial
effects of this practice, as exemplified by
experience, warrant its being at once proceeded
on to the exclusion of every other, until
it has totally failed.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Loin</span>, <i>s.</i> The back of an animal; loins, the reins.</p>

<p class='c006'>The loins occupy the attention of all good
judges in their consideration of a horse, and
for the purposes of strength they can hardly
be too broad: the back extends to the posterior
part of a common sized saddle, and where
the back ends, the loins begin. Sometimes,
from a defect in the sacral processes of the
vertebræ, this junction of the back and loins
presents an indentation, as though the union
was incomplete. This may be considered,
in some degree, as a defect, inasmuch as it
deprives the part of muscular attachment, and
such horses are said to be badly loined. The
strength of the loins depends on the length
of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ,
which should be long, that there may
be an extensive surface for the attachment of
the muscles of the back: the muscles themselves
should also be powerful on each side,
giving width to the loins, and seeming by
their enlargement, as it were, to swallow the
back bone. When the protuberances of the
ilium are very prominent, the horse is called
ragged hipped, which is injurious to the appearance
only, except in cases where it seems
to arise from a paucity of muscle to fill up the
intervening spaces. From the loins to the
setting on of the tail, the line should be long
and very slightly rounded; by which means,
also, the distance between the hip and the
point of the buttock will be considerable.
This formation is peculiar to the improved
or blood breed, and in every point of view
appears the most perfect; for it affords a very
increased surface for the insertion of the
powerful muscles of these parts.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Loo</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Loo or lue, subdivided into limited and unlimited
loo, a game, the complete knowledge
of which can be easily acquired, is played with
five or three cards, though most commonly
with five, dealt from a whole pack, either first
three and then two, or by one at a time.
Several persons may play together, but the
greatest number can be admitted when played
with three cards only.</p>

<p class='c006'>After five cards have been given to each
player, another is turned up for trump; the
knave of clubs generally, or sometimes the
knave of the trump suit, as agreed upon, is
the highest card, and styled Pam; the ace of
trumps is next in value, and the rest in succession,
as at whist. Each player has the
liberty of changing for others from the pack
all or any of the five cards dealt, or of throwing
up the hand in order to escape being looed.
Those who play their cards either with or
without changing, and do not gain a trick, are
looed; as likewise is the case with all who
have stood the game, if a flush occur, which
obliges each, except a player holding Pam, or
an inferior flush, to deposit a stake to be divided
among the winners at the ensuing deal,
according to the tricks which may then be
made. For instance, if every one at dealing
should stake half-a-crown, the tricks are entitled
to sixpence apiece, and whoever is looed
must put down half-a-crown, exclusive of the
deal: sometimes it is settled that each person
looed shall pay a sum equal to what happens
to be on the table at the time. Five cards of
a suit, or four with Pam, compose a flush,
which sweeps the board, and yields only to a
superior flush, or an equal one in the elder
hand. When the ace of trumps is led, it is
usual to say “Pam be civil,” the holder of
Pam is then expected to let the ace pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>When loo is played with three cards, they
are dealt by one at a time, Pam is omitted,
and the cards are not exchanged, nor permitted
to be thrown up.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_326.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The lugger is, I think, the most inconvenient
rig, especially for a yacht; the spars are
so heavy that they require all hands to move
them. They generally have two sets of lugs—large
ones, which require dipping every
time you tack; and small working lugs,
which do not require dipping, the tack coming
to the foot of the mast. The latter are generally
used, except in making long reaches, as
across Channel, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another great objection to a lugger is,
your decks are so encumbered with the spare
spars and sails, which take up a great deal of
room; besides the latter being exposed almost
continually to the weather, which they must
be while kept bent ready for setting; and,
thirdly, a lugger is seldom fit to be altered to
any thing but a schooner, not having breadth
enough for one mast, which, after all, for
beauty and speed, is the best: indeed, sailing
men are so perfectly aware of this now, that
you never see a schooner or lugger enter
against a cutter at all near their tonnage.
Take them to sea, and they might have a
chance; though even there (setting aside accidents)
I would back the cutter in a trial;
but in fine weather or smooth water there is
no comparison.—<i>Sport. Mag.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lungs</span>, <i>s.</i> The lights, the organs of respiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each side of the cavity of the chest is occupied
by soft, spongy, and slightly elastic
masses, called lungs, having the heart appended
between them. In a state of distension
they completely fill the parietes of the
thorax, to which their figure is exactly adapted.
The lungs have a distinct division into
a right and left mass, each of which presents
deep fissures, partially dividing its substance
into what are called its lobes. These divisions
are not always the same in every subject,
but in the majority of instances the right
and largest lung presents three lobuli, the
left two only. As already described, the
pleura first lines the thoracic cavity, and is
then reflected over the lungs, affording them
a dense covering: a second reflection from
each lung by a union of its laminæ, forms a
septum, or a complete division of the chest,
into two distinct cavities, and thus effectually
shuts out all communication between one
lung and the other, except by their vessels.
The colour of the lungs varies considerably:
in the colt they present a lively pinky hue;
in the adult horse they are darker, and in
very old subjects they have a greyish cast
and granulated appearance.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_327.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This variety is smaller than the greyhound,
with its limbs stronger and shorter, the head
less acute, with short, erect, and half-pricked
ears; the whole body and tail are covered
with rough coarse hair; it is grizzly about the
muzzle, and is of a pale sand colour, or iron
grey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lurcher is supposed to be originally
produced, first, by a cross of the greyhound
and harrier, and afterwards re-crossed with
the terrier; hence the quickness of his scent,
which he possesses in a strong degree. The
habits of this dog lead him to concealment
and cunning; and he is often employed in
killing hares and rabbits under the cloud of
night, for which nature seems eminently to
have fitted him. When taken to the warren,
he lies squat, or steals out with the utmost
precaution, when he either sees or scents the
rabbits feeding, and, like his progenitor, the
greyhound, darts upon them with exceeding
quickness, without barking or making the
least noise. He is trained to bring the booty
to his master, who often waits at some distance
to receive it. One of these dogs will
kill a great many rabbits in the course of a
night. Bewick says, that they were so destructive,
that they are now with great propriety
proscribed, and the breed is almost
extinct.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lure</span>, <i>s.</i> Something held out to call a hawk; any enticement.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use of this important implement in
breaking falcons, is thus described by Sir John
Sebright:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The hawk is to be fed upon the lure, being
first made to come to it when held very
near him, then when held a little farther off;
it is to be next thrown upon the ground to a
small distance, and thus he is to be brought
by degrees to fly to it, and to seize it eagerly,
however far it may be thrown.</p>

<p class='c006'>An assistant is now to swing the lure at
some distance from the falconer, who casts off
the hawk.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be thrown into the air when the
hawk is flying towards it, but so that he cannot
attain it until it falls to the ground, lest
he should be hurt by striking it in his flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this lesson has been repeated, until
the hawk has become eager to take the lure,
the assistant is to swing it as before, but is to
take it into his hand when the hawk is coming;
he is then to swing it again as soon as
the hawk has passed; and finally, to throw it
upon the ground, when the hawk is returning
towards him.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this way the hawk will soon be taught to
fly round the falconer, bending his flight inwards
when the lure is shown to him, or
when he hears the call of the falconer, who
should always halloo when he is luring. He
may thus be made to follow the falconer
wherever he pleases; this is called waiting on.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the hawk has alighted upon the lure,
the falconer is to walk round him, whistle to
him while he is feeding, and reward him with
a good meal when he is taken up.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is thus that hawks are made obedient to
the lure, and that they are exercised when
they cannot be flown at game, but they must
not be kept too long upon the wing, or they
would acquire the habit of flying low; and it
is the perfection of a slight falcon to soar as
high as possible.—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE MAGPIE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Its length is about eighteen inches; bill
strong and black; eyes hazel; the head, neck,
and breast are of a deep black, which is finely
contrasted with the snowy whiteness of the
under parts and scapulars; the neck-feathers
are long, as are also those on the back,
which extend towards the rump, leaving only
a small space, of a greyish ash-colour, between
them and the tail coverts, which are
black; the plumage in general is glossed with
green, purple, and blue, which catch the eye
in different lights; the tail is very long, and
rather wedge-shaped; the under-tail coverts,
thighs, and legs are black: on the throat and
part of the neck there is a kind of feathers,
mixed with the others, resembling strong,
whitish hairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful bird is everywhere common
in England; it is likewise found in various
parts of the continent, but not so far north as
Lapland, nor farther south than Italy: it is
met with in America, but not commonly, and
is migratory there. It feeds, like the crow, on
almost every thing animal as well as vegetable.
The female builds her nest with great
art, leaving a hole in the side for her admittance,
and covering the whole upper-part with
an interweaving of thorny twigs, closely entangled,
thereby securing her retreat from the
rude attacks of other birds: but it is not safety
alone she consults; the inside is furnished
with a sort of mattrass, composed of wool
and other soft materials, on which her young
repose: she lays seven or eight eggs, of a pale
green-colour, spotted with black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The magpie is crafty and familiar, and may
be taught to pronounce words, and even short
sentences, and will imitate any particular noise
which it hears. It is addicted, like other birds
of its kind, to stealing, and will hoard up its
provisions. It is smaller than the jackdaw,
and its wings are shorter in proportion; accordingly
its flight is not so lofty, nor so well
supported: it never undertakes long journeys,
but flies only from tree to tree, at moderate
distances.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>To destroy magpies.</i>—Wait till the female
sits hard on her eggs; and then go, late
in the evening, with some large shot in a
duck-gun, by which means you may either
take her as she flies out of the tree, or blow
up the whole concern by firing through the
nest.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Magpie Hawking</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Magpies may be flown with eyess slight
falcons, and afford excellent sport.</p>

<p class='c006'>A down or common, where low trees or
thorn bushes are dispersed at the distance of
from thirty to fifty yards apart, is the place
best calculated for this diversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a magpie is seen at a distance, a
hawk is immediately to be cast off. The magpie
will take refuge in a bush the moment
that he sees the falcon, and will remain there
until the falcon arrives, with the hawk waiting
on in the air. The magpie is to be driven
from his retreat, and the hawk, if at a good
pitch, will stoop at him as he passes to another
bush, from whence he is to be driven in the
same way, another hawk having been previously
cast off, so that one or the other may
always be so situated as to attack him to advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second hawk is necessary, for the magpie
shifts with great cunning and dexterity to
avoid the stoop; and when hard pressed, owing
to the bushes being rather far apart, will pass
under the bellies of the horses, flutter along
a cart rut, and avail himself of every little
inequality of the ground in order to escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four or five assistants, besides the falconer,
(who should attend solely to his hawks) are
required for this sport. They should be well
mounted and provided with whips; for the
magpie cannot be driven from a bush by a
stick; but the crack of a whip will force him
to leave it, even when he is so tired as hardly
to be able to fly. Nothing can be more animating
than this sport; it is, in my opinion,
far superior to every other kind of hawking.
The object of the chase is fully a match for
its pursuers—a requisite absolutely necessary
to give an interest to any sport of this kind;
and it has the advantage of giving full employment
to the company, which is not the
case in partridge-hawking.</p>

<p class='c006'>The magpie will always endeavour to make
his way to some strong cover; care, therefore,
must be taken to counteract him, and to
drive him to that part of the ground, where
the bushes are farthest from each other. It
is not easy to take a magpie in a hedge. Some
of the horsemen must be on each side of it;
some must ride behind, and some before him;
for, unless compelled to rise, by being surrounded
on all sides, he will flutter along the
hedge, so as to shelter himself from the stoop
of the falcon. Many requisites are necessary
to afford this sport in perfection—a favourable
country, good hawks, and able assistants.—<i>Sebright.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The mallard, or wild-drake, weighs from
thirty-six to forty ounces, and measures twenty-three
inches in length, and thirty-five in
breadth: the bill is of a yellowish-green colour,
not very flat, about an inch broad, and
two and a half long, from the corners of the
mouth to the tip of the nail: the head and
upper-half of the neck, are of a glossy, deep,
changeable, green, terminated in the middle
of the neck by a white collar, with which it
is nearly encircled: the lower part of the
neck, breast, and shoulders, are of a deep
vinous chestnut: the covering scapular feathers
are of a kind of silvery white; those
underneath, rufous; and both are prettily
crossed with small waved threads of brown:
wing-coverts ash; quills brown; and between
these intervenes the beauty-spot (common in
the duck tribe) which crosses the closed wing
in a transverse, oblique, direction; it is of a
rich, glossy, purple, with violet or green reflections,
and bordered by a double streak of
black and white. The belly is of a pale grey,
delicately pencilled and crossed with numberless
narrow-waved, dusky lines, which, on the
sides and long feathers that reach over the
thighs, are more strongly and distinctly marked:
the upper and under tail-coverts, lower part of
the back, and rump, are black; the latter
glossed with green: the four middle tail-feathers
are also black, with purple reflections,
and, like those of the domestic drake,
are stiffly curled upwards; the rest are sharp
pointed, and fade off to the exterior sides, from
a brown to a dull white; legs, toes, and webs
red.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plumage of the female is very different
from that of the male, and partakes of none
of his beauties, except the spot on the wings.
All the other parts are plain brown, marked
with black. She makes her nest, lays from
ten to sixteen greenish-white eggs, and rears
her young generally in the most sequestered
mosses or bogs, far from the haunts of man,
and hidden from his sight among reeds and
rushes. To her young helpless unfledged
family (and they are nearly three months
before they can fly), she is a fond, attentive,
and watchful parent, carrying or leading them
from one pool to another, as her fears or inclinations
direct her; and she is known in
this country to use the same wily stratagems
to mislead the sportsman and his dog, as those
before noticed respecting the partridge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Like the rest of the duck tribes, the mallards,
in prodigious numbers, quit the north
at the end of autumn, and, migrating southward,
arrive at the beginning of winter in
large flocks, and spread themselves over all
the loughs and marshy wastes in the British
isles. They pair in the spring, when the
greatest part of them again retire northward
to breed; but many straggling pairs stay with
us: they, as well as preceding colonists of
their tribes, remain to rear their young, who
become natives, and continue with us throughout
the year.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

Green malt has been recommended for improving
the condition of horses, and giving

<p class='c006'>The canine mange is a chronic inflammation
of the skin, dependent, in some instances, on
a morbid constitutional action: it is infectious
also, from miasms produced from animal exhalations;
and it is notoriously contagious
from personal communication with one affected.
It is not, however, so completely contagious,
in all its varieties, as is supposed, for
I have known dogs to sleep with affected ones
for some time without becoming mangy; but
in the majority of cases it is otherwise; and
in some the predisposition to it is such, that
almost simple and momentary contact will
produce it. The mange which is received by
contagion is more readily given to another
than that which is generated. The uniform
presence of animalculi within the psoric pustules
has revived the idea that it originates in
the attack of acari.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mange is also hereditary. A bitch, lined
by a mangy dog, is very liable to produce mangy
puppies; but the progeny of a mangy bitch is
certain to become affected sooner or later;
and I have seen puppies covered with it when
a few days old. The morbid action by which
mange is generated is excited in various ways,
and by various causes. When a number of
dogs are confined together, the acrid effluvia
of their transpiration and urine begets a miasm
productive of a virulent mange, very difficult
to be removed. Close confinement, with
salted food, is even more certainly productive
of mange; thus dogs who have come from
distant countries, on ship-board, are generally
affected with it. Very high living, with little
exercise, is a frequent cause: a state nearly
approaching to starvation is also not unfavourable
to it. In both these apparent contrarieties,
the balance between the skin and the
digestive functions is not preserved, and the
disease follows as a necessary consequence.
The disease has some permanent and fixed
varieties; it has also some anomalies; but
the pruritus or itching is common to all.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scabby mange, one of the most common
forms under which this eruptive complaint
appears, is an extension of the secretory
pores of the skin in very minute red vesicles,
that at first are distinct, but as they extend
become pustular, confluent, and scabby.
Sometimes simple linear cracks of the cuticle
seem to pour out a serous fluid, which concretes
into scab. It is occasionally confined
to the back; at others it is found principally in
the joints of the extremities.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The red mange, so called from a redness
of both skin and hair in the parts affected, is
likewise not unfrequent, and partakes much
of an herpetic character. In this variety there
is less pustular eruption, but nearly the whole
skin of the body, particularly in white-haired
dogs, is in a state of active inflammation: it is
also hot to the feel, and itches intolerably. In
the red mange, the hair itself becomes morbidly
affected, and alters in its colour, particularly
about the extremities: it also falls off,
and leaves the skin bare, much thickened, and
puckered into stubborn wrinkles. Dogs with
the strong coarse hair called wired are very
liable to this state; in which a magnifying
glass applied will often detect innumerable
minute ulcerations, covered by furfuraceous
scales.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Acute mange.</i>—Besides that variety just
noticed, there is yet a more directly acute
form of the complaint, which puts on an appearance
not unlike erysipelas in some instances;
in others it is a pure erythema, or red
efflorescence; but more frequently it is accompanied
with some ulceration. It commences
by a direct febrile attack, with panting heat,
and restlessness; next some part of the body
(usually the head) begins to swell, which, the
second or third day, gives place to ulceration
of the nose, eyelids, lips, ears, neck, &amp;c.
This ulceration proves superficial, but extensive;
and continues a longer or a shorter
period, as the treatment is more or less judicious.
Bleeding, aperients, and febrifuges,
form the constitutional remedies: the topical
ones are tepid fomentations the first two days;
and, when the tumefaction has given place to
ulceration, the application of a cooling unguent
of superacetate of lead (sugar of lead), with
spermaceti ointment, will be proper. What
remains of the affection, in a week or ten days’
time, may be treated as common mange.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Mange is apt to be considered more troublesome
than hurtful, which is a great error; for
it is not only invariably hurtful, but very
often fatal also: when long continued, it frequently
ends in dropsy. It sometimes diseases
the mesenteric glands, and the subjects
of it die tabid: neither in any case can it be
neglected with impunity. In sporting dogs
it is injurious to their qualities as well as their
health: their scent invariably becomes impaired,
and their general powers are always
weakened by its irritation.</p>

is small, and elegantly shaped: the eyes are

in magpies’ nests, breeds in the hollows of
trees, and brings from four to six young ones
at a time; they are brought forth with their
eyes unopened, but quickly arrive at a state
of perfection. The female has but a small
quantity of milk in proportion to her size, but
she amply compensates for this natural defect
by bringing home eggs and live birds to her
offspring, thus early habituating them to a life
of carnage and plunder. As soon as the young
are able to leave the nest, they are led by the
dam through the woods, where the birds at
once recognise their enemies, and fail not to
attend them, as they do the fox, with every
mark of animosity and terror. When taken
young, the marten is easily tamed, is extremely
playful and good-humoured; its attachment,
however, is not to be relied on if it gets loose,
for it will immediately take advantage of its
liberty, and retire to the woods, its natural
haunts. A farmer in the parish of Turling,
in Essex, was famous for taming this animal,
and had seldom less than two. Some years
since, one used to run tame about the kitchen
of the Bald-faced Stag inn, on Epping forest.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Buffon affirms of a marten that he had
tamed (it should seem but imperfectly), that
it drank frequently, sometimes slept two days
successively, and at other times continued as
long awake. When preparing for sleep, it
folded itself round, covering its head with its
tail. He describes its motions as so violent,
incessant, and troublesome, that it was necessarily
kept chained. After escaping from its
fetters, and returning once or twice, it at last
went entirely away.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pine marten (whose skin is considered
of a far superior quality to the common),
which is distinguished by a yellow throat and
breast, and of which such numbers are sold
at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s sales—at one
of which, 12,370 good skins, and 2360 damaged
ones, were sold; and about the same
time the French brought into the port of
Rochelle, from Canada, no less than 30,325
skins—is sometimes found in Wales, in
the counties of Merioneth and Carnarvon.
In Scotland it is the only kind of marten;
where it inhabits the fir forests, frequently
usurping the drays or nests of the squirrel,
building its own nest at the top of the trees,
and produces seven or eight young at a birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The marten’s food is poultry, game, and
small birds; it will not eat mice, rats, and
moles, and is said to feed also on grain, and
to be extremely fond of honey. It is said to
be a great enemy to cats, and will even attack
the wild cat, which, although much stronger,
is always worsted, and often killed in the
combat, and a contest is sure to take place
whenever they meet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scent of the marten is very sweet to
hounds, and it is the best animal to enter
young fox-hounds at. The marten, by running
to the thickest bushes it can find, teaches
hounds to run cover, which is of infinite service
to them. When closely pursued, it
climbs a tree, and its agility is astonishing,
for though it falls frequently from a tree into
the midst of a pack of hounds, each intent on
the catching it, the instances are very few of
a marten being caught by them in that situation.
They are not found in any great
numbers; the most ever met with by the
compiler, was in the large woods near Rayleigh,
in Essex.</p>

<p class='c006'>They attack the pheasants when at roost,
and make great havoc. The steel trap, baited
with a piece of pheasant or wood-pigeon, will
generally be successful. Some prefer the box
trap (such as is used in warrens), which
should be baited with a bird in the centre,
and the feathers strewed through the inside
of the trap, from one end to the other; but
a more certain way of catching them, in a
park or cover paled in, is the following: as
they constantly run the pales and posts to dry
themselves in the morning, have a groove cut
in some of the posts and gate-posts where
they run, sufficient to contain a strong hawk
or rat-trap; the trap must be set in this
groove, without a bait: in leaping upon the
place, they are sure to be taken. A small
chain should be fixed to the trap, and fastened
to the post.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common house cat, turned wild, is
another mortal foe to pheasants, and does
more mischief than many sorts of naturally
wild vermin. In Moulsham Thrift, a large
cover belonging to Sir H. St. John Mildmay,
sixteen of these animals were killed by a pack
of fox-hounds, in four days, drawing the cover
for foxes. They may be destroyed in traps,
like the marten; but the bait must be sprinkled
with valerian, and if the hutch or box-trap
be used, valerian should be scattered in
and about the trap, which will certainly allure
them, for of this drug they are immoderately
fond.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another way to take either the wild or the
pole cat, is to set box-traps in the bottom of
the ditches, or under walls or pales, with the
ends of the traps fenced up, for four or five
yards aslant, and two or three yards wide at
the entrance, with earth, bushes, or broken
pales, so that the vermin shall not pass without
entering the traps. This is the method
used by warreners. When the traps are so
placed, a trail of rabbits’ paunches should be
drawn from one trap to another, and the baits
are red herrings half broiled. Each end of
the traps is to be rubbed with them, and a
part of the herring is to be afterwards hung
upon the nail over the bridges of the traps.
This is a mode that will cause great destruction
amongst them. A thin bag, sufficiently
large to admit an end of the trap, is to be
provided and slipped over it, when any of the
traps are sprung, and by rattling at the other
end of the trap, the creature will spring into
the bag; for without precaution, if it be a
wild cat, the moment the light is admitted,
it will fly in the face of the person opening it.
By having both ends of the box-traps painted
white, and rubbed over with the entrails of any
animal, the hares will be deterred from entering,
at the same time it will allure the vermin
to go into the traps.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Martlet</span>, <i>s.</i> A kind of swallow; the bank swallow.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Industry of Birds.</i>—Dr. Steel, who lives
near the mineral springs of Saratoga, in New
York, has ascertained that the bank swallow
(<i>hirundo riparia</i>) knows how to vary, according
to necessity, the construction of its
nest. If it finds sandy banks, it bores holes
in them, and thus forms for its future family
a commodious habitation, into which none of
their enemies can enter. When this resource
is wanting, it approaches the houses, and,
although less accustomed to man than the
swallow of the windows, it attaches its nest
to granaries, farm-yard sheds, and similar edifices;
and then, it being necessary to build
instead of to dig, it selects materials, transports
them, and puts them in their proper
places. It thus appears that this species of
swallow has not essentially the habits indicated
by its specific name; but that it will live
contentedly wherever it can find food, safety,
and the charms of society; for isolated families,
or solitary nests, are never seen. A
little colony, which established itself in the
neighbourhood of Saratoga in 1828, increased
so rapidly that in 1830 it consisted of several
hundreds of nests.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>For some time after they appear, the hirundines
in general pay no attention to the
business of nidification, but play and sport
about, either to recruit from the fatigue of
their journey, if they do migrate at all, or else
that their blood may recover its true tone
and texture after it has been so long benumbed
by the severities of the winter.
About the middle of May, if the weather be
fine, the martin begins to think in earnest of
providing a mansion for its family. The
crust or shell of this nest seems to be formed
of such dirt or loam as comes most readily to
hand, and is tempered and wrought together
with little bits of broken straws to render it
tough and tenacious. As this bird always
builds against a perpendicular wall without
any projecting ledge under, it requires its
utmost efforts to get the first foundation
firmly fixed, so that it may safely carry the
superstructure. On this occasion the bird
not only clings with its claws, but partly supports
itself by strongly inclining its tail against
the wall, making that a fulcrum; and thus
steadied, it works and plasters the materials
into the face of the brick or stone. But then
that this work may not, while it is soft and
green, pull itself down by its own weight, the
provident architect has prudence and forbearance
enough not to advance her work too
fast; but by building only in the morning,
and by dedicating the rest of the day to food
and amusement, gives it sufficient time to dry
and harden. About half-an-inch seems to be
a sufficient layer for a day. Thus careful
workmen when they build mud walls (informed
at first perhaps by this little bird) raise but a
moderate layer at a time, and then desist; lest
the work should become top-heavy, and so be
ruined by its own weight. By this method
in about ten or twelve days is formed an hemispheric
nest with a small aperture towards
the top, strong, compact, and warm; and
perfectly fitted for all the purposes for which
it was intended. But then nothing is more
common than for the house sparrow, as soon
as the shell is finished, to seize on it as his
own, to eject the owner, and to line it after
its on manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>After so much labour is bestowed in erecting
a mansion, as Nature seldom works in
vain, martins will breed on for several years
together in the same nest, where it happens
to be well sheltered, and secure from the injuries
of weather. The shell or crust of the
nest is a sort of rustic-work full of knobs and
protuberances on the outside; nor is the inside
of those that I have examined smoothed
with any exactness at all; but is rendered
soft and warm, and fit for incubation, by a
lining of small straws, grasses, and feathers;
and sometimes by a bed of moss interwoven
with wool. In this nest they tread, or engender,
frequently during the time of building;
and the hen lays from three to five
white eggs.—<i>White’s Selborne.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Martingal</span>, <i>s.</i> A broad strap made fast to the girths under the belly of
a horse, which runs between the two legs to fasten the other end under
the noseband of the bridle.</p>

<p class='c006'>The martingal is generally attached to a
horse who throws his head up. It is unsafe
in the field, and only efficient when used by a
light handed and practised rider.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mash</span>, <i>s.</i> Anything mingled or beaten together into an undistinguished
or confused body; a mixture for a horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bran mashes are made by pouring boiling
water on fresh sweet bran in a pail, so that
the mixture, when stirred, may be about the
consistency of a soft poultice; it is then to
be covered over, and not given to the horse
until sufficiently cold. When it is thought
necessary to steam the head, as it is termed,
the mash is put into the manger while hot.
Steaming the head is recommended in strangles,
colds, and sore throats.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bran mashes are proper in fever and all
inflammatory complaints. They are useful
also as a preparative to physic, serving to remove
indurated fæces, and to facilitate the
operation of the medicine. Mashes are a
necessary diet while physic is operating. In
making malt mashes, the water should be
below the boiling point, otherwise the malt
would be spoiled. Mashes are given for recruiting
strength, when a horse is debilitated
from fever or any other cause. When a horse
has been fed high for some time with oats
and beans, a change to bran mashes for two
or three days will often do a great deal of
good. The bran should be fresh, and perfectly
free from any musty smell. There is a finer
kind of bran, named gurgings or pollard,
which, though more nutritious, is not so fit
for medicinal purposes.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mash</span>, <i>v.</i> To beat into a confused mass; to mix malt and water together
in brewing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Master-sinew</span>, <i>s.</i> A large sinew that surrounds the hough, and divides
it from the bone by a hollow place, where windgalls are usually seated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mastic</span>, <i>s.</i> A kind of gum gathered from trees of the same name; a kind
of mortar or cement.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mastication</span>, <i>s.</i> The act of chewing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hay, as often given, is too dry for mastication
or digestion. If it has been suffered to
stand until the seed becomes ripe, it is very deficient
in nutriment, and difficult of digestion;
and, however perfectly it may be masticated,
will only serve to oppress the stomach without
affording any thing that is capable of being
formed into good chyle. Hay that has been
kept more than one year becomes dry and deficient
in nutriment, especially when kept in
small mows and exposed to the wind. When
such hay therefore is given to horses, it requires
to be moistened with water, and given
in moderate quantity. From eight to twelve
pounds of hay and one peck of oats is a sufficient
allowance, both as to proportion and
quantity, for any saddle horse of whatever size
he may be, provided he has only moderate
work; but when his exertions exceed that degree
which may be termed moderate, then an
additional allowance is necessary, and that addition
should be in oats or beans.</p>

<p class='c006'>The teeth may be imperfect, and often are
so; the grinders wear in a different manner
from that in which they would, were the animals
in a state of nature: consequently sharp
edges are sometimes formed on the outside of
the higher grinders, and on the inside of the
lower grinders; and the inside of the cheeks
and the tongue, with the skin or membrane
connected with it, are thereby wounded,
which prevents the horse from masticating,
without considerable pain, and induces him to
swallow his food imperfectly chewed; this is
more especially the case with hay; and when
hay is swallowed in this state it does harm,
being difficult of digestion, as then its nutritive
matter is not easily extracted by the
gastric power; hence arise indigestion, flatulency,
and numerous disorders. Mastication
may be impeded or prevented by that state of
the mouth which generally attends teething:
it may also be affected by an injudicious use
of the bit (as is well known in regiments of
cavalry where it is too common), and has been
attributed to the spiculæ of the squirrel-tail
grass. The consequence of this imperfection
is worms, in addition to indigestion and all its
consequences.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mastiff</span> (<i>Canis Anglicus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>), <i>s.</i> A dog of the largest size.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_338.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is a large and powerful animal, much
stronger than the bull dog; his ears are longer
and more pendulous; his lips are full and
loose, the upper one hanging considerably over
the lower at the two extremities; his aspect
is grave and somewhat sullen; and his bark
loud, deep-toned, and terrific, particularly
during the night.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mastiff differs in form from the bull-dog
in being much longer in the legs, and not
so deep in the chest; and while his head is
large in proportion to his body, he wants the
projecting under jaw of the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Buffon was of opinion that the mastiff is
not an original race, but a mongrel generated
betwixt the Irish greyhound and the bull-dog.
This, however, must be mere conjecture;
for the mastiff, in his pure and uncontaminated
state, has a much more dignified
aspect than either of these dogs; and we are
rather inclined to believe him to be an original
breed peculiar to Britain. We are borne out
in this opinion, as we find it on record that so
early as the time of the Roman emperors,
this country was celebrated on account of its
dogs of this kind. At the period Great Britain
was under the Roman yoke, an officer
was appointed to live here, whose sole business
it was to breed, select, and send to Rome
such as promised, by their size and strength,
to become fit for the combats of the amphitheatre.
Dr. Caius, in his Treatise on British
Dogs, tells us that three mastiffs were reckoned
a match for a bear, and four for a lion.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog, from his large size and commanding
aspect, is naturally calculated to intimidate
strangers, and he is admirably suited for and
principally used in protecting large and extensive
premises containing property of value,
which he watches with most scrupulous care
and assiduity. He is so instinctively impressed
with the importance of his charge, that
he will only quit it with the loss of his life,
which he will rather forfeit than betray the
confidence reposed in him. With his naturally
commanding and imposing appearance,
calculated to keep at a distance the ill-intentioned,
he is nevertheless possessed of the
greatest mildness of manners, and is as solicitous
to gain attention and as faithfully grateful
for favours bestowed, as the most diminutive
of the canine tribe. The mastiff displays
one peculiarity which seems inherent,—his
ferocity is always increased by the degree of
restraint in which he is kept. If constantly
on the chain he is much more dangerous to
approach than when in a state of liberty;
from whence it evidently appears that what
may be considered as a friendly kindness on one
side, is always productive of confidence on the
other.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mastiff usually shows a remarkable
and peculiar warmth in his attachments, and,
on the other hand, he is equally distinguished
for inveteracy in his dislike. If he is once
severely corrected or insulted, it is almost
impossible to eradicate the feeling from his
memory, and it is no less difficult to obtain a
reconciliation with him. He seems conscious
of his own strength, power, and authority,
and will seldom condescend to lower his dignity
by servile fawning, while he appears to
consider his services as only befitting a trust
of the highest importance. This dog is naturally
possessed of strong instinctive sensibility,
speedily obtains a knowledge of all the duties
required of him, and discharges them too with
the most punctual assiduity. In the protection
of gardens, houses, woodyards, and widely
extended manufactories, his vigilance is very
striking; he makes regular rounds of the
whole premises like a watchman, examines
every part of them with a careful eye; his
penetration reaches even the remotest corner,
and not a spot is passed by until he is satisfied
that all is in a state of perfect security. During
the night he gives a signal of his presence
by repeated and vociferous barkings, which are
increased upon the least cause of alarm; and,
contrary to the spirit of the bull-dog, whose
invariable practice is to bite before he barks,
the mastiff always warns before he attacks.
This breed is very difficult to be obtained in
purity, from the various admixtures and experimental
crosses which have taken place.
The genuine old English mastiff is now rarely
to be seen, although we have dogs of various
sizes and colours which go under that name.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal, conscious of his superior
strength, has been known to chastise, with
great propriety, the impertinence of an inferior:—a
large dog of this kind, belonging to
the late M. Ridley, Esq., of Heaton, near
Newcastle, being frequently molested by a
mongrel, and teased by its continual barking,
at last took it up in his mouth by the back,
and with great composure dropped it over the
quay into the river, without doing any further
injury to an enemy so much beneath his

streaks; the scapulars and wing coverts
are some black and some white; quills dusky;
tail brown; legs orange; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Pennant says this species breeds in the
Isle of Ely, on the shores amongst the loose
stones. They sometimes appear in the south
of England in winter, but more frequently in
the north, and are said to breed in Scotland in
some of the lochs. They are found in the
Russian dominions, about the great rivers of
Siberia.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are also said to breed on the shores of
Greenland, and are observed at Hudson’s Bay
in large flocks, breeding there as well as at
Newfoundland, chiefly on the islands. The
nest, which is built on the margin of lakes and
rivers, is said to be made with dry grass, lined
with down; the eggs are generally eight in
number, of a bluish white; sometimes as many
as thirteen in a nest, about the size of those of
a duck. The young may be distinguished from
the adult, by the black band on the wing spot.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mergus</span>, <i>s.</i> A genus in ornithology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birds of this genus have roundish slender
bills, furnished at the end with a hard, horny,
crooked nail; edges of the mandibles very
sharply toothed, or serrated; the nostrils
small, subovated, and placed near the middle
of the bill: tongue rough, with hard indented
papillæ turned backward; legs short; feet
webbed; toes long, and the outer ones about
the same length as the middle; the head is
small, but the quantity of soft silky feathers
with which it is furnished, and which they
can bristle up from the nape of the neck to
the brow, give it a large appearance. They
are a broad, long-bodied, and flat-backed kind
of birds, and swim very squatly on the water,
the body seeming nearly submerged, with
only the head and neck clearly seen. They
are excellent divers, remaining a long while
under water, and getting to a great distance
before they appear again. They fly near the
surface of the water, and, notwithstanding
the shortness of their wings, with great swiftness,
though seldom to any great distance.
They devour a large quantity of fish; and
their pointed sharp-toothed, and hooked bills,
are well calculated for holding fast their
slippery prey, none of which, when once
within their gripe, can escape. Latham enumerated
six species and three varieties of this
genus, five of which are accounted British
birds. George Strickland, Esq., of Ropin,
enumerates six species of this genus, which are
all met with in Great Britain and its adjacent
isles: the author agrees with him likewise in
opinion, that much remains to be done in
order to clear up the doubts in which their
history is involved, and by which the classification
of different species is confused: he
says, “The genus mergus, though only a very
small tribe of birds, still remain in the greatest
obscurity, and I have not yet met with any
ornithologist, who has not, in my opinion,
multiplied the number of the species, by considering
birds of this genus as of different
kinds, when they differ only in sex.” His
arrangement is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Merlin</i>—(<i>Falco Æsalon</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>L’Emerillon</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The smallest of all
the hawk kind, scarcely exceeding the size of
a black bird. Its bill is blue; cere and irides
yellow; the head is of a rust colour, streaked
with black; back and wings of a deepish
brown, tinged with ash, streaked down the
shafts with black, and edged with rust colour:
quill feathers dark tipped and margined on
the inner webs with reddish white: the
breast and belly are of a yellowish white,
with streaks of rusty brown pointing downwards;
the tail is long, and marked with
alternate dusky and pale bars; the wings,
when closed, do not reach quite to the end of
the tail; the legs are yellow; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The merlin, though small, is not inferior
in courage to any of the falcon tribe. It was
used for taking larks, partridges, and quails,
which it would frequently kill by one blow,
striking them on the breast, head, or neck.
Buffon observes, that this bird differs from
the falcons, and all the rapacious kind, in
the male and female being of the same size.
The merlin does not breed here, but visits us
in October; it flies low, and with great celerity
and ease. It preys on small birds, and
breeds in woods, laying five or six eggs.</p>

<p class='c006'>What has so often been said of herrings,
mackerel, and other gregarious fish moving in
vast shoals from Shetland to the Orkneys, and
of their then dividing and surrounding the Islands
of Great Britain and Ireland, is, I think,
liable to some objections.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the last month (April) large shoals
of mackerel came on the shallows, a few miles
from Brighton, one day, and disappeared the
next. This is constantly observed to be the
case, not only there but in other places, and
may perhaps be accounted for in this way. We
must consider that there are probably as many
mountains, and valleys, and plains in the sea
as we know there are on land. We are to
recollect that those mountains and valleys are
covered with weeds of various kinds, which
afford food and shelter to an infinite number
of fish and marine animals and insects; and
we know that all fish come into shallow water
for the purpose of depositing their ova, which
the influence of the air, not, as has been commonly
supposed, of the sun, is required for
bringing to maturity. Is it not probable, then,
that the shoals of fish which are found on our
fishing banks, have left some neighbouring
deep, where they had retired for the winter,
till they are rendered buoyant by the quantity
of roe within them, and are directed by instinct
to go and deposit it in the adjacent shallows?
If, as is generally supposed, all fish, both great
and small, from the whale to the herring, have
each their respective haunts and localities, why
should we suppose that they quit those haunts
to go many hundred miles in search of spawning
ground, when that ground is to be found
near their winter retreats? It appears more
probable that the large shoals of fish which are
found are quite unconnected with each other,
and that they have all just quitted some neighbouring
deep for the nearest shallow, only
moving on as the ground is occupied, or till
they have paired and the roe is ready to be
deposited.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Minnow</span>, <i>s.</i> A very small fish, a pink.</p>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful little fish abounds in many
of our small gravelly streams, where they keep
in shoals; it is sometimes called the pink, and
when in right season and not sick, which only
happens just after spawning, is dappled, its sides
inclining to a greenish watery sky colour, its
belly white, and its back almost black, but
these colours are not universal; the body is
slender and smooth, the scales being extremely
small; it seldom exceeds three inches in length;
the lateral line is of a golden colour, the back
flat and of a deep olive; the sides and belly
vary greatly in different fish, as a few are of a
rich crimson, others are bluish, and others
white. The tail is forked, and marked near
the base with a dusky spot. The minnow appears
first in March, continues until Michaelmas,
and then betakes himself to the mud, weed-roots,
or wood in rivers, to secure himself from
floods and fishes of prey. They are usually
full of spawn all the summer (for they breed
often), and quickly arrive at their growth and
perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although so diminutive in size, the minnow
may be compared for the excellency of its taste
to many of the most famed fish; they are in
some places made into minnow tansies; after
being gutted and well washed in salt and water,
their heads and tails cut off, they are then to
be put with yolks of eggs well beat with cowslips
and primrose flowers, and a little tansy
shred very small, and fried in good butter; the
sauce to them is butter, vinegar, or verjuice,
and sugar. To the young sportsman, who has
not possessed himself of the patience requisite
to form the angler, the minnow yields plenty
of amusement. They will in hot weather
bite eagerly all day, and are frequently drawn
out of the water from their adhering to the end
of the worm, without being touched by the
hook; the best way to catch them, is, to have
three or four very small hooks, baited with the
least red worm, or a piece of one, and a crow
quill float; fish deeper than midwater, or near
the ground in shallow places, in eddies, and at
the sides of small streams.</p>

<p class='c006'>Minnows are very excellent baits for many
fish, as will hereafter be specified, and when
wanted in haste for that purpose, a small
meshed casting-net will save much time and
trouble, as enough for a day’s diversion may
be caught at a throw or two in shallow streams.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Minnow Fishing.</i>—The tackle for minnow
fishing for trouts, should be of the same
sort as that for salmon, with this difference,
that it must be finer, with a stout single silk
worm gut at bottom, and the hook No. 2, 3,
or 4, according to the bigness of the trout in
the water where angled for: the middle-sized
and whitest minnows are the best (of which
those caught in streams are far brighter than
those procured from ditches or stagnated waters),
and the way of baiting recommended by
Walton, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>“To put the hook in at the mouth and draw
it out through the gill about three inches; then
again put the hook in at the mouth, and let
the point and beard come out at the tail; then
tie the hook and the tail about with a fine white
thread, which will make it spin quicker; pull
back that part of the line which was slack when
the hook was thrust in the second time, which
will fasten the head of the minnow, so as to
make it be almost straight on the hook; try if
it turns well, which it cannot do too fast.
Angle with the point of the rod down the
stream, drawing the minnow against the current
gradually, and near the surface: when
descried, the trout will freely come at it; be
careful not to snatch it away, nor strike until
he has turned with the bait. For this angling
the winch and ringed rod is to be always used;
and there should be two or three swivels on
the line, which will assist the spinning of the
minnow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Walton’s method may be altered and improved,
by first thrusting the hook in at the
lower side of the minnow’s under, and also
quite through the upper chap, drawing it two
or three inches on the line, and putting the hook
in at the mouth as before directed; this will
keep the minnow’s mouth closed, which otherwise
should be stitched up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various hooks are recommended in minnow
fishing; one much used consists of a large
hook, with two very small ones fastened back
to back to a piece of gut about two inches
long, with a small hook to another gut something
shorter, to fasten the head of the minnow:
these pieces of gut are so attached to
the link, that the two small hooks may be
about the middle of the minnow when baited,
and the other reach the head; a small lead
cap (which renders other weight unnecessary)
slides upon the link, keeps the short pieces of
gut close, and falls upon the head of the minnow.
The advocates for this plan boast of the
certainty of hooking the trout with the two
small hooks; this may be true, says an angler
of no inconsiderable skill, but he asks if these
small hooks (which seldom exceed No. 12)
are sufficient to kill a trout of any bigness;
and when a fish is hooked by these, the other
hooks are entirely useless, from the situation
in which they are placed. Another objection
started by the same gentleman, is, that when
the gut to which they are tied has been a short
time in the water, it will not sustain the
weight of the hooks, but they will sink below
the minnow, and are continually foul of weeds
and rubbish at the bottom; besides, the lead
cap, falling upon the minnow’s head, totally
conceals the eyes, parts which add life and attraction
to the bait, and are, on that account,
so essential to be seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some use about three feet of stout silkworm
gut for the bottom links, with two or
three small swivels, which prevents the line
from being entangled, and assists the twirling
of the minnow. If these hooks are used as
directed for pike, it will be successful; the
bottom swivel must be open at one end, that
the link on which the hooks are may be taken
off occasionally to be baited; the proper size of
these hooks is No. 7; if the old method of a
large hook and a smaller above it, be preferred,
the proper sizes are Nos. 2 and 6, with a running
line; the angler can permit the minnow
to be carried by the current under bushes,
banks, &amp;c.; this will be effected by his suffering
the stream to gain upon it when he pulls
it back, which also prevents its sinking to the
bottom, and entangling the hooks; as he
draws it gently against the stream, favouring
the direction to which he would have the bait
driven, it will of course spin round very quick,
and this is the moment the trout usually takes
it; by holding the rod firm, he will infallibly
hook himself; will then spring out of the
water several times, and, by an astonishing
strength and agility, endeavour to get quit of
the hook. The angler must not be too hasty,
but lower his right hand, which will raise the
top of his rod and keep it bent; by this means
the trout may be tired, but he will not readily
suffer himself to be got into the landing-net;
the best way therefore, instead of bringing the
fish to the surface (where he will so violently
plunge, as to endanger breaking the rod, line,
or hook), is to keep him as deep in the water
as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Artificial minnows made of mother of pearl,

bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>The length of this bird is about eleven
inches. The bill is dusky, the base of the
lower bill yellow; the eyes hazel; the head,
back, and lesser coverts of the wings, are of a
deep olive brown, the latter tipped with white:
the lower part of the back and rump tinged
with yellow; the cheeks are of a yellowish
white, spotted with brown, as are also the
breast and belly, which are marked with
larger spots of a dark brown colour; the quills
are brown, with pale edges; tail feathers the
same, the three outermost tipped with white;
the legs are yellow, claws black. The female
builds her nest in bushes or low trees, and
lays four or five eggs, of a greenish blue
colour, marked with red spots. Its nest is
made of moss, leaves, &amp;c., lined with dry
grass, strengthened on the outside with small
twigs. It begins to sing very early, often on
the turn of the year in blowing showery
weather, whence in some places it is called the
storm-cock. Its note of anger is very loud
and harsh, between a chatter and a shriek,
which accounts for some of its names. It
feeds on various kinds of berries, particularly
those of the misletoe, of which birdlime is
made. It was formerly believed that the
plant of that name was only propagated by
the seed which passed the digestive organs of
this bird, whence arose the proverb—“<i>Turdus
malum sibi cacat</i>;” likewise feeds on
caterpillars and various kinds of insects, with
which it also feeds its young.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mule</span>, <i>s.</i> An animal generally between a he-ass and a mare, or between a

<p class='c006'>These useful and hardy animals are the
offspring of the horse and ass, or ass and
mare; those produced between the two last
are esteemed the best, as the mule is observed
to partake less of the male than of the female
parent; yet it is a general remark, that
they almost always inherit, in some degree,
the obstinacy of the parent ass, though it must
be confessed that this vice is heightened by
their being injudiciously broke in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Savoy produces very large mules, but the
finest are bred in Spain. They are chiefly
used in countries where there are rocky and
stony roads, as about the Alps and Pyrenees,
&amp;c. Great numbers of them are kept in
these places, they are usually black, and are
strong, well-made, and large, being mostly
bred out of fine Spanish mares. They are
sometimes fifteen or sixteen hands high, and
a good one of this kind is worth fifty or sixty
pounds. No creature is so proper for carrying
large burdens, or more surefooted. They
are much stronger for draught than our horses;
often as thick-set as our dray-horses, and will
travel for several months together with six or
eight hundred weight on their backs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mule far excels the horse for travelling
in a mountainous country, the former being
able to tread securely where the latter can
hardly stand. Their manner of going down
the precipices of the Alps, the Andes, &amp;c., is
very extraordinary. In these passages, on one
side are steep eminences, and on the other
frightful abysses, and as they generally follow
the direction of the mountain, the road, instead
of lying on a level, forms at every little
distance, deep declivities of several hundred
yards downward. These can be descended
only by mules, and these animals seem sensible
of the danger, and the caution that is to
be used in such descents. When they come
to the edge of one of these precipices, they
stop, without being checked by the rider, and
if he inadvertently attempts to spur them on,
they continue immovable, apparently ruminating
on the danger that lies before them,
and preparing themselves for the encounter.
They not only attentively view the road, but
tremble and snort at the danger. Having prepared
for the descent, they place their fore-feet
in a posture as if they were stopping
themselves, they then put their hind-feet
together, but a little forward, as if they were
going to lie down. In this attitude, having
taken, as it were, a survey of the road, they
slide down with the swiftness of a meteor. In
the mean time, all that the rider has to do, is
to keep himself fast on the saddle without
checking the rein, for the least motion is sufficient
to disorder the equilibrium of the mule,
in which case they both unavoidably perish.
But their address in this rapid descent is
truly wonderful, for in their swiftest motion,
when they seem to have lost all government
of themselves, they follow exactly the different
windings of the road, as if they had previously
settled in their mind the route they were to
follow, and had taken every precaution for
their safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>In these journeys the natives place themselves
along the sides of the mountains, and
holding by the roots of the trees, animate
the beasts with shouts, and encourage them to
persevere. Some mules, after being long used
to such travelling, acquire a kind of reputation
for their safety and skill, and their value rises
in proportion to their fame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Roman ladies had equipages drawn by
mules, as appears from the medals of Julia
and Agrippina, and at this day, in Spain, the
carriages of the nobility, and even of princes,
are usually drawn by them. We are assured
that M. de Thou, first president of the parliament,
had the fourth coach in France, in
1505, till which time every body rode to
court and parliament on mules.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The progeny between the pheasant and the
common fowl, are necessarily mules, as proceeding
from different species, although of
the same genus. They may be obtained
with some little difficulty, which they scarcely
repay, as being neither an improvement in
form nor goodness of the flesh. It is recommended,
as the best method, to confine a
cock-pheasant half grown with two pullets of
the same age, either game, bantam, or common,
as may be desired; or to make a house
for common hens in a pheasant preserve near
home, where they will soon associate with
the pheasants, and be trodden by the cocks.
Hybrids, or mules, between the pheasant and
black grouse, have been occasionally found on
the moors.—<i>Le Keux</i>—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mullet</span>, <i>s.</i> A sea fish.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_349.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The mullet is found in great plenty on
several of our sandy coasts, and, in particular,
haunts those small bays that have influxes of
fresh water; they are very cunning, and when
surrounded with a net, the whole shoal frequently
escapes by leaping over it; for when
one takes the lead, the others are sure to follow.</p>

<p class='c006'>They come in great shoals into the rivers
with the tide during the summer, and keep
rooting, like hogs, in the sand or mud, leaving
their traces in the form of large round holes;
but return back when the water ebbs, never
stopping in the rivers. They are something
like the dace in shape, yet much thicker; the
head is almost square and flat on the top; the
nose blunt; lips thick; they have no teeth,
only the upper-lip is a little rough, as is also
the tongue; between the eyes and mouth is a
hard callus; the pupil of the eye is black,
encircled with a small silvery line; the colour
of the back is dusky, varied with blue
and green; the sides silvery, marked with
broad, dusky, parallel lines, reaching from
head to tail, which is much forked; the
scales are large and deciduous, and are also
upon the covers of the gills and head, and
extend as far as the nostrils. The largest are
nearly half a yard long, and the flesh is excellent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the mullet are generally first
seen here in the month of June, from the
wetness of this summer the shoals are later in
their appearance than usual. Mullet are taken
in draught-nets like salmon, but on this coast
a different mode of fishing is pursued. The
shoals in hot weather run in with the tide,
and after remaining on the shores and estuaries
during flood they return with the ebbing
water. The following method we employed
in our fishing to-day: being provided with a
sufficient quantity of herring-nets and a number
of spars and poles, we selected, at low
water, a sandy creek for our operations, and
commenced erecting a line of poles across the
entrance of the cove. The nets were then
extended along these uprights, and also secured
firmly to the bottom of the spars; the
lower part of the net is kept upon the bottom
by a row of stones, and the remainder
laid flat upon the sands. With the flowing
tide the fish pass over the prostrate net, and
run along the estuary; at high water the
buoy-ropes are raised and secured to the upright
poles; with the assistance of a boat the
whole is effected in a few minutes, and a net-work
barrier effectually cuts off the retreat
of all within. When the ebb of tide commences,
the mullet begin to retire, and when
they discover that their egress is obstructed,
their attempts to effect a passage are both constant
and curious—now running down the
nets, trying for a broken mesh by which to
force an aperture—now with a bold spring
endeavouring to clear the buoy-ropes, and,
even after repeated failures, leaping at it again
and again. The last effort is directed to the
bottom, but there the heavy stones resist
every attempt to dislodge them, and deserted
by the treacherous water, the mullet are left
upon the bare sands.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The general length of the common mullet
(<i>mugil</i>) is from twelve to eighteen inches.
When used immediately after being taken,
the fish is excellent; carriage, even for a short
distance, injures it. Dr. Blotch recommends
oil and lemon-juice to be used with it at table.
Vinegar, with parsley and melted butter, is
better—“probatum est.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is much larger than the common
duck, measuring about two feet in length.
The bill is two inches long; the tip and nostrils
brown; the other parts of it red, as is
also the red warty skin which joins its base,
and surrounds the eyes. The crown of the
head is rather tufted or crested, and black;
the cheeks, throat, and fore part of the neck,
white, irregularly marked with black; the
belly, from the breast to the thighs, white.
The general colour of the rest of the plumage
is deep brown, darkest, and glossed with green
on the back, rump, quills, and tail; the two
outside feathers of the latter, and the first
three of the former, are white: the legs and
feet are red, short, and thick. This is the
general appearance of the musk duck; but,
as it is domesticated in almost every country,
it varies very much, like all other birds in
that state. In the female, the bare warty or
carunculated skin which is spread from the
bill over the eyes, is of a much duller red,
and does not cover so large a portion of the
head as it does in the male: she is also of a
less size.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds have obtained the name of
Musk Duck, from their musky smell, which
arises from the liquor secreted in the glands
on the rump. They are a thriving and prolific
species, and their flesh, which is highly
flavoured, is by many very much esteemed.
They will associate with the common ducks;

<p class='c006'>Chronic lameness may exist in various degrees,
and, in the early stages of the disorder,
a horse may do considerable work, by paring
his feet properly, and keeping them cool and
moist; by paring the soles, putting on a wide
hollow shoe, and keeping them stopped with
tar ointment. By such management the progress
of the disease may be retarded, and the
horse much relieved; but it can never be
cured. Most commonly the disease gradually
gets worse, and at length the horse becomes unfit
for every kind of work. At this period the horse
is generally blistered or fired, and turned to
grass. But this never does any good; shoes
with claws, or hinges and screws, have been
proposed, and employed with a view to open
the heels; but of course they have never done
any good, either in the way of prevention or
cure. The hoof has been all rasped away,
and the horse turned to grass until a new hoof
has grown down of a proper form, but it has
never done any good. That cruel operation
of tearing off the sole, technically termed
drawing the sole, was formerly practised for
it, but is now, I trust, completely discontinued.
In short, every thing that human
ingenuity can devise has been tried, but
nothing has ever been found to cure this disorder.
I believe at this time all veterinarians
agree in the opinion of its being absolutely
incurable.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Neck</span>, <i>s.</i> The part between the neck and the body; a long narrow part.</p>

<p class='c006'>The neck should form from the head to
the withers, an elegant but moderate curve,
with which it should unite with a very moderate
depression only; while its under surface
ought to be but very slightly incurvated, and
should enter the chest rather above the point
of his shoulders. A large prominent windpipe
adds to the perfection of the lower surface
of the neck. In point of length, it is of
consequence that the neck be duly proportioned.
The long neck, when thin withal,
seldom presents a firm or proper resistance
against the pressure of the bit. When, on
the contrary, the neck is too short, the head
is frequently ill placed, and the lever in the
hand of the rider will be also too short.
Such necks are often likewise weighty, and
overloaded with flesh. It is evident, also, that
such cannot be reined up without danger of
suffocation; and it is seldom that a short-necked
horse is speedy. When the upper
surface of the neck is thick and heavy, it is a
very strong presumption of a sluggish disposition,
particularly in geldings and mares. In
stallions, it is a <i>distinctive sexual</i> mark, and
hence less to be depended on. Now and then,
the neck is arched downwards, which is called
ewe-necked. When the deformity is considerable,
it prevents the head from being carried
in its true angle; instead of which, the
nose, from being projected upwards and forwards,
has occasioned such horses to be called
stargazers; to remedy which, it is usual to
draw the head down by a martingal. In the
horse, as well as in all the grazing tribes, the
length of the well proportioned neck is such,
that, adding to it the angle resulting from the
head, the length of both is equal to the height
of the shoulders from the ground. It may
not, also, be amiss to mention, that, in the
purchase of a horse, it is prudent to observe
whether the upper part of the neck bears any
marks of a tight collar having been worn:
when such an appearance does exist, it commonly
arises either from a strap worn to prevent
the action of crib-biting, or such a horse
is apt to unloose himself, which is almost an
equal defect.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

far a horse that has undergone the operation
of the division of the nerve of the leg, and has
recovered from the lameness with which he
was before affected, and stands his work well,
may be considered to be sound. In our opinion
there cannot be a doubt about the matter.
Does the operation of neurotomy render a horse
as capable of work as he was before he became
affected with the disease on account of which,
and to relieve him from the torture of which,
the nerve was divided? Is the operation of
neurotomy so invariably followed by capability,
and continued capability of ordinary and
even extraordinary work, that they may regularly
be considered as cause and effect? The
most strenuous defenders of the nerve operation
cannot affirm this. They can only say
that they partially succeed in almost every fair
case,—that they perfectly succeed in the majority
of cases; but they cannot deny that the
horse will batter and bruise that foot, when he
has lost sensation in it, which should have
been tenderly used; that even the hoof will
sometimes be lost, after operations performed
with the greatest judgment; that the lameness
will sometimes return, after the animal has
gone sound, one, two, or three years; and that,
after all, there is a little unpleasantness, and
even unsafeness in the action of the horse,
from the peculiar manner in which the foot
meets the ground when its feeling is destroyed;
and that the horse is more liable to accidents,
for he will travel on without warning his rider
of the evil, after a piece of glass has penetrated
his foot, or a stone has insinuated itself
between the sole and the shoe; and thus irreparable
mischief will be done, before the cause
of it can possibly be detected. A horse on
whom this operation has been performed may
be improved—may cease to be lame, may go
well for many years; but there is no certainty
of his continuing to do so, and he is unsound.</p>

<p class='c006'>The snipe net seems to be the most destructive,
and is used with great success in
Ireland, as follows: it must be about half as
long again as the partridge-net, with the meshes
much smaller and not quite so deep; two
strong men hold each end of the net, and run
down the wind with it, as fast as possible, having
not time even to look where they are going,
as they must constantly mind the net, to see
when a bird strikes it, that they may let it fall,
by which means they secure these birds; they
get, of course, very severe falls, from the attention
they are obliged to pay to the net,
but are amply repaid, it being no uncommon
circumstance for them to take one or two
hundred brace, in a very few hours (especially
if the day is dark and windy, which is
the most favourable time both for gun and
net). The top part of the net gets so forward,
that by the time the snipe perceives it, and
rises, on striking the lower part of it, he is
secured. One netted snipe is worth twenty
that are shot.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Anecdote of Netting Snipes.</i>—Visionary
in the extreme were many of the devices
which entered into his head in regard to compassing
the wild fowl, that resorted hither in
astonishing abundance; in two only of those
which he put into execution was he successful;
namely with the talking hare, and the snipe
net. Of his numberless expeditions with the
latter, one is worthy of recital. It was at the
close of a cold winter’s day, when John and an
attendant sallied forth from Grenton for the
moor, anticipating much sport, as the wind and
the complexion of the evening seemed particularly
favourable; moreover they soon encountered
a hail-storm, which made the birds
lie to their perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had at length taken a quantity of
snipes, and were thinking about returning,
when something struck the net with unusual
force, and struggled so, that the poles were
with difficulty kept to the ground. What have

dog, or goat? It is the d——l, I believe, replied
John, and if we can but hold him fast,
we shall have made a tolerable night’s work
of it. The net had enclosed a goose of a coarse
dun-coloured plumage, no one knew what sort
of a goose it was, but it was allowed to be the

<p>NEWFOUNDLAND DOG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In a state of purity, and uncontaminated
by a mixture of any inferior race, this is certainly
the noblest of the canine tribe. His
great size and strength, and majestic look, convey
to the mind a sort of awe, if not fear, but
which is quickly dispelled when we examine
the placid serenity and the mild expressive
intelligence of his countenance, showing at
once that ferocity is no part of his disposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The full-sized Newfoundland dog from the
nose to the end of the tail measures about
six feet and a half, the length of the tail
being two feet; from the one fore foot to the
other, over the shoulders, five feet eight
inches; girth behind the shoulders three feet
four inches; round the head, across the ears,
two feet; round the upper part of the fore
leg, ten inches; length of the head, fourteen
inches; and his feet are webbed, by which
means he can swim with great ease. He is
covered with long shaggy hair, has feathered
legs, and an extremely villous tail, which is
curvilinear.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog is but of recent introduction into
this country from the island whose name he
bears, and may be considered as a distinct
race. I cannot agree with some naturalists
who hold the opinion that the Siberian, Lapland,
and Iceland dogs are from the same stock
as the Newfoundland, because the formation
of the head in this last is very different, and
his muzzle, though long, is not nearly so
acute as in the others; he also differs materially
in his shape, but more especially in the
length of his body.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog is not remarkable for symmetry
of form, or in the setting on of his legs,
whence his motion is somewhat awkward and
loose, and consequently he is not distinguished
for speed,—a defect which might be remedied
by breeding, were an improvement in that
particular thought desirable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Newfoundland dog is docile to a very
great degree, and nothing can exceed his affection.
Naturally athletic and active, he is
ever eager to be employed, and seems delighted
to perform any little office required of him.
Nature has given him a great share of emulation,
and hence to be surpassed or overcome
is to him the occasion of great pain. Active
on every emergency, he is the friend of all,
and is naturally without the least disposition
to quarrel with other animals. He seldom or
never offers offence, but will not receive an
insult or injury with impunity. Such is the
capacity of his understanding, that he can be
taught almost everything which man can inculcate,
and of which his own strength and
frame are capable. His sagacity can only be
exceeded by his energies, and he perseveres
with unabated ardour in whatever shape he
is employed, and while he has a hope of success
he will never slacken in his efforts to
attain it. The amazing pliability of his temper
peculiarly fits him for the use of man, and
he never shrinks from any service which may
be required of him, but undertakes it with an
ardour proportionate to the difficulty of its
execution. Taking a singular pride in being
employed, he will carry a stick, a basket, or a
bundle, for miles in his mouth, and to deprive
him of any of these is more than a stranger
could accomplish with safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sagacity and a peculiar faithful attachment
to the human species are characteristics inseparable
from this dog, and hence he is ever on
the alert to ward off from his master every
impending danger, and to free him from every
peril to which he may be exposed. He is
endowed with an astonishing degree of courage,
whether to resent an insult or to defend
his friends, even at the risk of his own life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Habitually inclined to industrious employment,
such dogs are as useful to the settlers
of the coast from which they are brought, as
our ponies and galloways are to us. It is easy
to accustom them to daily labour. From
three to five of them are harnessed to a sledge
or other vehicle, containing a load of wood or
lumber, amounting to twenty or thirty stone,
which they steadily draw for miles with ease.
This they do without the aid of a driver, when
they are acquainted with the road, and having
delivered their burden, they return home to
their master, and receive as a reward for their
labour their accustomed food, which generally
consists of dried fish, of which they are said
to be extremely fond. The qualifications of
this dog are extensive indeed; as a keeper or
defender of the house, he is far more intelligent,
more powerful, and more to be depended
upon than the mastiff, and has of late years
been much substituted for him in England;
indeed he may with great propriety entirely
supersede that breed. As a watch dog, and for
his services upon navigable rivers, none can
compete with him; and various sportsmen have
introduced him into the field as a pointer with
great success, his kind disposition and sagacity
rendering his training an easy task.</p>

<p class='c006'>The usual fate of other fine dogs attends
this generous race among us; they are too
often degraded and degenerated by inferior
crosses, which with so noble an animal should
be avoided by every possible means.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the commencement of the action which
took place between the Nymph and Cleopatra,
during the late war, there was a large Newfoundland
dog on board the former vessel,
which the moment the firing began ran from
below deck, in spite of the endeavours of the
men to keep him down, and climbing up into
the main-chains he there kept up a continual
barking, and exhibited the most violent rage
during the whole of the engagement.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Cleopatra struck, he was among
the foremost to board her, and there walked
up and down the decks, seemingly conscious
of the victory he had gained.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Newt</span>, <i>s.</i> Eft, small lizard.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Nick</span>, <i>s.</i> A notch cut in anything; in hazard, a winning throw.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Nick</span>, <i>v.</i> To hit, to touch luckily; to cut in nicks or notches; to suit, as
tallies cut in nicks; a term at hazard; to shorten a horse’s tail.</p>

<p class='c006'>The operation of nicking is thus performed.
The side line is put on the horse, or some deem it
more prudent to cast him, and that precaution
we should be disposed to recommend. The hair
at the end of the tail is securely tied together
for the purpose of afterwards attaching a weight
to it. The operator then grasps the tail in his
hand, and lifting it up, feels for the centre of
one of the bones (the prominences at the extremities
will guide him to this), from two to
four inches from the root of the tail, according
to the size of the horse. He then with a
sharp knife divides the muscles deep from the
edge of the tail on one side to the centre, and
continuing the incision across the bone of the
tail, he makes it as deep on the other side.
One continued incision, steadily, yet rapidly,
made, will accomplish this. If it be a blood
horse this will be sufficient. For a hunter,
two incisions are usually made, the second
being about two inches below the first, and
likewise as nearly as possible in the centre of
one of the bones; the reason of which is, that
the incision, in order perfectly to divide the
muscles that bring down the tail, must not be
so deep, as, in the neighbourhood of a joint, to
endanger the wounding of the ligament which
ties the bones together, or the substance which
is interposed between the joints, and thus by
destroying the joint to render the tail deformed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On a hackney, or cocktail, a third incision
is made; for fashion has decided that his tail
shall be still more elevated and curved. Two
incisions only are made in the tail of a mare,
and the second not very deep.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the second incision is made, some
fibres of the muscles between the first and
second incisions will project into the wounds,
and which must be removed with a pair of
curved scissors. The same must be done with
the projecting portions from between the second
and third incisions; and the wounds
should be carefully examined to ascertain that
the muscles have been equally divided on each
side, otherwise the tail will be carried awry.
This being done, pledgets of tow must be introduced
deeply into each gap, and confined,
but not too tightly, by a bandage. A very
profuse bleeding will alone justify any tightness
of bandage; and the ill consequences
which have resulted from re-nicking are mainly
attributable to the unnecessary force which
is used in confining these pledgets. Even if
the bleeding, immediately after the operation,
should have been very great, the roller must
be loosened in two or three hours, otherwise
swelling and inflammation, or death, may possibly
ensue. Twenty-four hours after the operation,
the bandage must be quite removed;
and then, all that is necessary, so far as the
healing of the wounds is concerned, is to keep
them clean.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is curious to observe with what different
degrees of architectonic skill Providence has
endowed birds of the same genus, and so
nearly correspondent in their general mode of
life; for while the swallow and the house
martin discover the greatest address in raising
and securely fixing crusts or shells of loam as
<i>cunabula</i> for their young, the bank martin
terebrates a round and regular hole in the
sand or earth, which is serpentine, horizontal,
and about two feet deep. At the inner end
of this burrow does this bird deposit, in a good
degree of safety, her rude nest, consisting of
fine grasses and feathers, usually goose feathers,
very inartificially laid together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perseverance will accomplish any thing:
though at first one would be disinclined to
believe that this weak bird, with her soft and
tender bill and claws, should ever be able to
bore the stubborn sandbank without entirely
disabling herself; yet with these feeble instruments
have I seen a pair of them make great
despatch: and could remark how much they
had scooped that day by the fresh sand which
ran down the bank, and was of a different
colour from that which lay loose and bleached
in the sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>In what space of time these little artists are
able to mine and finish these cavities I have
never been able to discover, for reasons given
above; but it would be a matter worthy
of observation, where it falls in the way of
any naturalist to make his remarks. This I
have often taken notice of, that several holes
of different depths are left unfinished at the
end of summer. To imagine that these beginnings
were intentionally made in order to
be in the greater forwardness for next spring,
is allowing perhaps too much foresight and
<i>rerum prudentia</i> to a simple bird. May not
the cause of these <i>latebræ</i> being left unfinished,
arise from their meeting in those
places with strata too harsh, hard, and solid,
for their purpose, which they relinquish, and
go to a fresh spot that works more freely?
Or may they not in other places fall in with
a soil as much too loose and mouldering,
liable to founder, and threatening to overwhelm
them and their labours?</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing is remarkable—that, after some
years, the old holes are forsaken and new
ones bored; perhaps because the old habitations
grow foul and fetid from long use, or
because they may so abound with fleas, as to
become untenantable. This species of swallow,
moreover, is strangely annoyed with fleas;
and we have seen fleas, bed fleas, (<i>Pulex irritans</i>,)
swarming at the mouths of these holes,
like bees on the stools of their hives.—<i>White’s

<p class='c006'>Night-fishing is carried on when the river

resort, to form beds in the stream, wherein
to deposit their ova; and they continue working
on the sand, until they are discovered by
torch-light, and gaffed by the plunderer.
Hundreds of the breeding fish are annually
thus destroyed; and although the greater
fisheries may be tolerably protected, it is
impossible to secure the mountain streams
from depredation.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Nightingale</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird that sings in the night with remarkable melody.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the finest songsters of the feathered
race, generally visiting us, about London, the
beginning of April; in Somersetshire it seldom
arrives till the middle or latter end of
that month, and sometimes not till the beginning
of May; Devonshire, and Cornwall, and
some other counties, it does not visit at all:
it generally leaves us again the beginning of
September. Its song, when wild, is very fine,
but lasts but a few weeks; to have it in the
greatest perfection is to have a good bird in a
cage, where, if it be a very kindly one, it will
begin singing the beginning of December, and
continue till June. I had a very fine one
that only left off singing the latter end of
June last; it began again a little in September,
and the 1st of December it was in full
song, and continued to sing through the whole
of the month, and nearly all day long, as fine
as if at Midsummer, and would have continued
on had not the frost set in so severe;
when singing in a cage none of the soft notes
are lost, they are all heard quite clear, which
is not the case when heard in the woods or
hedges.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best way to be certain of a good nightingale
is to get one that is just caught in
spring; for there is no dependence on a young
one bred up from the nest, or a young brancher,
except it be kept with a good old bird, to learn
its proper notes from; a young one being apt
to catch all it hears, good or bad, and to be
deficient of many of its natural ones. I had
one three years, and it never sang worth any
thing; the year before last I turned it out,
and it continued in the gardens round the
house until it left the country in autumn; it
returned back to the same place last spring,
where I recognised it by its bad song, and it
continued about the same place all the summer,
and bred up a nest of young ones. A
female that I had also been keeping for six
years, to see if she would breed, I also turned
out with him, but whether she came back and
was partner in the nest I cannot say, as I had
no mark to know her by: this female I kept
four years, and it never attempted to sing; the
fifth year it sang frequently, a pretty soft
nightingale’s note. I have found that the
case with several female birds; they do not
sing till they become aged; but it is not a
general rule, as I have had a female willow
wren that sang when quite young.</p>

<p class='c006'>I treat my nightingales in exactly the same
manner as the before-mentioned birds, which
is at variance with the bird-fanciers’ method,
who feed them on grated beef and egg, and
German paste; but I have never heard of any
thing being kept many years on that food:
the German paste I do not approve of at all,
as the maw-seeds, honey, sugar, and such out
of the way ingredients, I am convinced must
be very injurious to their health. The best
thing to keep them in good health and spirits,
is to give them as much insect food as possible,
and there are scarcely any insects they
will refuse, except the common earth-worm
and the hairy caterpillars; they are particularly
fond of ants and their eggs, for which
they will leave any other food; they are also
very partial to all sorts of smooth caterpillars,
earwigs, crickets, grasshoppers, cockroaches,
common maggots, and meal-worms; but there
is nothing that all the birds of this tribe are
so fond of, as the young larvæ in the combs of
wasps and hornets—they will even eat them
after they become winged. I have, when a
boy, kept nightingales, blackcaps, the greater

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ninepin</span>s, <i>s.</i> A play where nine pieces of wood are set up on the ground
to be thrown down by a bowl.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kayle-pins were afterwards called kettle
or kittle-pins; and hence, by an easy corruption,
skittle-pins, an appellation well known
in the present day. The game of skittles as
it is now played, differs materially from that
of nine-pins, though the same number of pins
are required in both. In performing the latter,
the player stands at a distance settled by mutual
consent of the parties concerned, and casts
the bowl at the pins: the contest is, to beat
them all down in the fewest throws. In
playing at skittles there is a double exertion;
one by bowling, and the other by tipping: the
first is performed at a given distance, and the
second standing close to the frame upon
which the pins are placed, and throwing the
bowl through in the midst of them; in both
cases, the number of pins beaten down before
the return of the bowl, for it usually passes
beyond the frame, are called fair, and reckoned
to the account of the player; but those that
fall by the coming back of the bowl are said
to be foul, and of course not counted. One
chalk or score is reckoned for every fair pin;
and the game of skittles consists in obtaining
thirty-one chalks precisely: less loses, or at
least gives his antagonist a chance of winning
the game; and more requires the player to
go again for nine, which must also be brought
exactly, to secure himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hanmer intimates that the kittle-pins were
sometimes made with bones; and his assertion
is strengthened by the language of a dramatic
writer, the author of the Merry Milk-maid of
Islington, in 1680, who makes one of his characters
speak thus to another: “I’ll cleave
you from the skull to the twist, and make nine
skittles of thy bones.”—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This is a medicine of great utility in veterinary

<p class='c006'>In fevers, it is often joined with emetic tartar,

nitre is the best remedy; and in troublesome
coughs it gives relief, if mixed with some emollient
drink and a little honey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The medium dose of nitre is about one ounce,
though farriers often give double that quantity,
but large doses are apt to irritate the stomach

ginger, it may be of service in those complaints,
the continuance of which depends upon debility.

<p class='c006'>It is somewhat extraordinary that I and
other sportsmen, as well as the gun-makers,
should never have discovered that a punched
wadding on the powder is not the best means
of loading a gun. We were all content, because
it was ten times better than paper, and
therefore it is, and has long been, the universal
method of loading. But I was induced to
try an experiment at quires of paper, having,
as I always do, a clerk, the same as at a cricket
match, to take down the advantages of strength
and closeness, and then to sum up the evidence
and pronounce, like a judge, the grand
aggregate of the gun’s performance; which,
on such occasions, is seldom so undecided as to
be merely a matter of opinion. I first tried
a pasteboard wadding of Mr. Joseph Manton’s,
and no one, I presume, will dispute, that both
the punch and the wadding, as well as every
thing else from Mr. Joseph Manton, must be
of the best quality; the one as to fitting well,
and the other as to being of good pasteboard.
I then tried this duck-gun system of loading,
viz.: a piece of coarse tarred oakum (precisely
what ships’ ropes are made of,) first wound
round the finger, so as to be quite hard, and
then rolled up in as large a ball as will fit
tight into the muzzle, and go with moderate
force down the calibre of the gun. (The
balls thus rolled up may be readily made and
carried in the pocket; and, if of the proper
size, will force down the calibre rather quicker
than punched wadding. Let the calibre be as
large as it may, you of course, with this wadding,
require nothing more on the powder.)
I then put a common pasteboard wadding
(with air vent) on the shot, and I found, that
even in small guns, where pasteboard is far
less apt to swerve, this mode of loading threw
the shot closer, stronger, and, above all, with
less variation in its performance.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the experiment, I anticipated an increase
of recoil, particularly when I came to try it
with a detonater; but, on the contrary, the
recoil was less from the oakum than from the
wadding. The case, I conceive, must be this:
the punched wadding gives a severe check at
first, but before the powder is half burned, it
slips a little on one side, and allows it to mix
with the shot; while the oakum has an elastic
rotundity, that springs to every gradation,
of the calibre; and therefore will never suffer
any powder to escape, till it has left the muzzle
of the gun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, on the other hand, the pasteboard
being once a little contracted by the
friction, or rendered soft on its edges by the
elastic fluid in the barrel, allows the powder
to escape where the calibre becomes relieved,
and therefore makes the gun, in comparison,
shoot thin, weak, and irregular.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

procured from animal and vegetable substances

because they do not evaporate, except at a

contrary, evaporate readily, and are obtained
from vegetables by distillation; and as they
commonly contain all the essential qualities of
the substance they are procured from, they
have been named also essential oils. The

<p class='c006'><i>To dye fine Green Olives.</i>—Take a pound

strawall short, and put it down. (You ought
to have a frame or wooden crop, and a broad
piece of lead, to keep down the stuff, as it
takes so very long to give out the dye.)
When it has boiled about half an hour, see if
it is anything of a fine greenish yellow. Draw
then for the first shade. Boil half an hour
longer; look at it, and if you like it draw it,
as it is not right to have your shades too near.
For the next shade give double the time, and
so on to about four shades. The last ought
to get six hours’ boiling, and you ought, by
rights, to divide the time amongst them all.
When you have made out four shades, lift out
the dye stuff, and put in the size of a small
horse-bean of copperas with the liquor; and,
when dissolved, put in each shade, and whip
it out, and so on with the whole. If not
enough of the olive, add a little more copperas
with each, and dip each of them over again.
Thus you have four very fine green olives.

reddish capsules of some species of dock, which
is considered an indication of its goodness, as
the inferior kinds of opium have none of these
capsules adhering to them. Turkey opium
generally contains about one fourth part of
impurities. India opium is less pure, is in
round masses, covered with leaves to the thickness
nearly of one fourth of an inch. Mr.
Kerr relates that, at Bahar, it is frequently adulterated
with cow dung, the extract of the
poppy procured by boiling, and various other
substances. It is made also from lettuces, in
India.</p>

<p class='c006'>A celebrated preparation of opium, named
the <i>black drop</i>, is thus prepared:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Boil them to a proper thickness, then add a
quarter of a pound of sugar and two spoonfuls
of yeast. Set the whole in a warm place near
the fire for six or eight weeks, then place it
in the open air until it becomes a syrup;
lastly decant, filter, and bottle it up, adding
a little sugar to each bottle. One drop of
this is said to be equal to three drops of the
tincture of opium.</p>

<p class='c006'>The diseases of the horse in which opium
is the most beneficial, are locked jaw and
flatulent colic; in the former it has been
given in large doses, with the best effect,
generally joined with camphor, and sometimes
with assafœtida and other antispasmodics. In
flatulent colic, smaller doses have been found
sufficient, which have generally been joined
with sweet spirit of nitre, and other carminatives.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Orange</span>, <i>a.</i> Belonging to an orange, of the colour of an orange.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye a fine Orange.</i>—If you have half
a pound of stuff to dye, you must get an
ounce and a half of black grain (cochineal),
and pound it fine; put down the stuff in six
or eight quarts of water, with turmeric, to
bring it to the finest highest yellow that is
possible; take it out, and put in the black
grain; stir it about well, boil it half an hour.
Then put in the stuff for ten minutes, and
draw half for the first shade; keep the remainder
of the stuff for thirty minutes, then
take it out, put two teaspoonfuls of Brazil
dust into the pot, and let it boil up. Throw
in the light shade, and be watchful lest it
get too dark; lift out the stuff, and put in
two more spoonfuls of dust, and watch as
before, and boil on for a blood orange. This
is certainly the best way for oranges in the
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should you make your shades too dark,
infuse six drops of spirit into the liquor
while hot, and any shade you want to brighten
throw it in, press it well, and lift out in an
instant; and if not to your wish, put in three
drops more, and throw the other shades into
it, and it will enliven the colour exceedingly.
The same may be done with gold colours, and
it will brighten them also.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye Orange Hackles.</i>—Get white
hackles; prepare them as already directed.
Ground them richly in turmeric, then put in
some cochineal, boil it well, and if you do not
soon get a fine rich orange, put in some more
cochineal with a pinch of Brazil dust. Let it
boil for a time, and then draw for bright
orange; put in more cochineal, and a teaspoonful
of Brazil dust; boil it well, and you
will have a full or deep orange. Draw the
hackles, and put in a spoonful or two of Brazil
dust, and boil on till you see a fine blood
red. These three shades may be distinguished
as a bright orange, a blood orange, and a blood
red. Archil will give a fourth shade.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Take care not to dry your hackles too
quickly, neither put them too near the fire.
Finish one bunch at a time, and draw them
constantly through your fingers till dry, as
that keeps the hackles in proper form. You
should keep the wet hackles rolled up in
paper, as, if they dry too fast, they will get
ragged and staring, which is a great fault, and
can seldom be cured. To stain fine bright
golden yellows, follow the same process, with
this difference,—that the quantity of turmeric
and madder used must be very small, and
only two drops of spirits should be infused, if
any be necessary.—<i>Old Recipe.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>A good ornithologist should be able to distinguish
birds by their air as well as by their
colours and shape; on the ground as well as
on the wing, and in the bush as well as in
the hand. For, though it must not be said
that every species of birds has a manner peculiar
to itself, yet there is somewhat in most
genera at least, that at first sight discriminates
them, and enables a judicious observer to pronounce
upon them with some certainty. Put
a bird in motion</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Thus kites and buzzards sail round in circles
with wings expanded and motionless:
and it is from their gliding manner that the
former are still called in the north of England
gleads, from the Saxon verb <i>glidan</i>, to glide.
The kestrel or wind-hover has a peculiar mode
of hanging in the air in one place, his wings
all the while being briskly agitated. Hen-harriers
fly low over heaths or fields of corn,
and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or
setting-dog. Owls move in a buoyant manner,
as if lighter than the air; they seem to
want ballast. There is a peculiarity belonging
to ravens that must draw the attention even of
the most incurious—they spend all their leisure
time in striking and cuffing each other on
the wing in a kind of playful skirmish; and
when they move from one place to another,
frequently turn on their backs with a loud
croak, and seem to be falling to the ground.
When this odd gesture betides them, they are
scratching themselves with one foot, and thus
lose the centre of gravity. Rooks sometimes
dive and tumble in a frolicsome manner;
crows and daws swagger in their walk; woodpeckers
fly <i>volatu undoso</i>, opening and closing
their wings at every stroke, and so are always
rising or falling in curves. All of this genus
use their tails, which incline downward, as a
support while they run up trees. Parrots,
like all other hook-clawed birds, walk awkwardly,
and make use of their bill as a third
foot, climbing and descending with ridiculous
caution. All the <i>Gallinæ</i> parade and walk
gracefully, and run nimbly; but fly with difficulty,
with an impetuous whirring, and in a
straight line. Magpies and jays flutter with
powerless wings, and make no despatch; herons
seem encumbered with too much sail for
their light bodies, but their vast hollow wings
are necessary in carrying burthens, such as
large fishes, and the like; pigeons, and particularly
the sort called smiters, have a way
of clashing their wings the one against the
other over their backs with a loud snap; another
variety called tumblers turn themselves
over in the air. Some birds have movements
peculiar to the season of pairing; thus ringdoves,
though strong and rapid at other times,
yet in the spring hang about on the wing in a
toying and playful manner: thus the cock-snipe,
while breeding, forgetting his former
flight, fans the air like the wind-hover; and
the greenfinch in particular exhibits such languishing
and faltering gestures as to appear
like a wounded and dying bird; the kingfisher
darts along like an arrow; fern-owls, or goat-suckers,
glance in the dusk over the tops of
trees like a meteor; starlings, as it were,
swim along, while missel-thrushes use a wild
and desultory flight; swallows sweep over the
surface of the ground and water, and distinguish
themselves by rapid turns and quick
evolutions; swifts dash round in circles; and
the bank martin moves with frequent vacillations
like a butterfly. Most of the small
birds fly by jerks, rising and falling as they
advance. Most small birds hop, but wagtails
and larks walk, moving their legs alternately.
Skylarks rise and fall perpendicularly as they
sing; woodlarks hang poised in the air; and
titlarks rise and fall in large curves, singing in
their descent. The whitethroat uses odd jerks
and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and
bushes. All the duck kind waddle; divers
and auks walk as if fettered, and stand erect
on their tails; these are the <i>compedes</i> of
Linnæus. Geese and cranes, and most wild
fowls, move in figured flights, often changing
their position. The secondary <i>remiges</i> of
<i>Tringæ</i>, wild ducks, and some others, are
very long, and give their wings, when in motion,
a hooked appearance. Dabchicks, moorhens,
and coots, fly erect, with their legs
hanging down, and hardly make any despatch;
the reason is plain, their wings are placed too
forward out of the true centre of gravity, as
the legs of auks and divers are situated too
backward.—<i>White’s Selborne.</i></p>

<p>THE OSPREY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffon observes that the osprey is the most
numerous of the large birds of prey, and is
scattered over the extent of Europe, from
Sweden to Greece, and that it is found even
in Egypt and Nigritia. Its haunts are on the
sea shore, and on the borders of rivers and
lakes. Its principal food is fish; it darts
upon its prey with great rapidity, and with
undeviating aim.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ossification</span>, <i>s.</i> Change of carneous, membranous, or cartilaginous, into
bony substance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ossification of the cartilages frequently accompanies
ringbone, but it may exist without
any affection of the pastern joint. It is oftenest
found in horses of heavy draught. It arises
not so much from concussion, as from a species
of sprain, for the pace of the horse is slow.
The cause, indeed, is not well understood, but
of the effect we have too numerous instances.
Very few heavy draught horses arrive at old
age without this change of structure.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the healthy state of the foot, these cartilages
will readily yield to the pressure of the
fingers on the coronet over the quarters, but,
by degrees, the resistance becomes greater, and
at length bone is formed, and the parts yield
no more. No evident inflammation of the
foot, or great, or perhaps even perceptible lameness
accompanies this change; a mere slight
degree of stiffness may have been observed,
which, in a horse of more rapid pace, would
have been lameness. Even when the change
is completed, there is not in many cases any
thing more than a slight increase of stiffness,
little or not at all interfering with the usefulness
of the horse. When this altered structure
appears in the lighter horse, the lameness
is more decided, and means should be taken
to arrest the progress of the change: these are
blisters or firing; but, after those parts have
become bony, no operation will restore the
cartilage.—<i>The Horse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Otter</span>, <i>s.</i> An amphibious animal that preys upon fish.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_367.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The description of this animal and the
mode of destroying it are mentioned on account
of its being so inveterate a foe to the
fisherman’s amusement, for the otter is as
destructive in a pond as a polecat in a hen-house.
This animal seems to link the chain
of gradation between terrestrial and aquatic
creatures, resembling the former in its shape,
and the latter in being able to remain for a
considerable space of time under water, and
being furnished with membranes like fins
between the toes, which enable it to swim
with such rapidity as to overtake fish in their
own element. The otter, however, properly
speaking, is not amphibious; he is not formed
for continuing in the water, since, like other
terrestrial creatures, he requires the aid of
respiration; for if, in pursuit of his prey, he
accidentally gets entangled in a net, and has not
time to cut with his teeth the sufficient number
of meshes to effectuate his escape, he is
drowned. The usual length of the otter, from
the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, is
twenty-three inches; of the tail itself, which
is broad at the insertion and tapers to a point,
sixteen; the weight of the male is from eighteen
to twenty-six, of the female from thirteen to
twenty pounds. One, in October, 1794, was
snared in the river Lea between Ware and
Hertford, which weighed upwards of forty
pounds. The head and nose are broad and
flat; the eyes are brilliant, although small;
are nearer the nose than is usual in quadrupeds,
and placed in such a manner as to discern
every object that is above, which gives
the otter a singular aspect, not unlike the eel;
but this property of seeing what is above gives
it a particular advantage when lurking at the
bottom for its prey, as the fish cannot discern
any object under them, and the otter seizing
them from beneath by the belly readily takes
any number with little exertion; the ears are
extremely short, and their orifice narrow; the
opening of the mouth is small, the lips are
capable of being brought very close, somewhat
resembling the mouth of a fish; are very muscular,
and designed to close the mouth firmly
while in the action of diving, and the nose
and corners of the mouth are furnished with
very long whiskers; it has thirty-six teeth,
six cutting and two canine above and below;
of the former the middlemost are the least;
it has besides five grinders on each side in
both jaws. The legs are very short, but remarkably
broad and muscular; the joints articulated
so loosely, that the otter can turn
them quite back, and bring them on a line with
its body and use them as fins; each foot has
five toes, connected by strong webs like those
of a water-fowl; thus nature in every particular
has attended to the way of life allotted
to an animal whose food is fish, and whose
haunts must necessarily be about waters. The
otter has no heel, but a round ball under the
sole of the foot, by which its track in the mud
is easily distinguished, and is termed the seal.
The general shape of the otter is somewhat
similar to that of an overgrown weasel, being
long and slender; its colour is entirely a deep
brown, except two small spots of white on
each side the nose, and one under the chin;
the skin is valuable, if killed in the winter,
and makes gloves more durable, and which at
the same time will retain their pliancy and
softness after being repeatedly wetted, beyond
any other leather.</p>

<p class='c006'>The otter destroys large quantities of fish,
for he will eat none unless it be perfectly
fresh, and what he takes himself; by his mode
of eating them he causes a still greater consumption.
So soon as the otter catches a fish,
he drags it on shore, devours it to the vent,
but, unless pressed by extreme hunger, always
leaves the remainder, and takes to the water
in quest of more. In rivers it is always observed
to swim against the stream, to meet its
prey; it has been asserted, that two otters will
hunt in concert that active fish the salmon;
one stations itself above, the other below where
the fish lies, and being thus chased incessantly
the wearied salmon becomes their victim. To
suppose the otter never uses the sea is a mistake,
for they often have been seen in it, both
swimming and seeking for their booty, which,
in the Orkneys, has been observed to be cod
and conger.</p>

<p class='c006'>In very hard weather, when its natural sort
of food fails, the otter will kill lambs, sucking
pigs, and poultry, and one was caught in a
warren, where he had come to prey on rabbits.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hunting of the otter was formerly considered
as excellent sport, and hounds were
kept solely for that purpose. The chase of the
otter has still, however, its staunch admirers,
who are apparently as zealous in this pursuit
as in any other we read of. In 1796, near
Bridgnorth, on the river Worse, four otters
were killed: one stood three, another four
hours, before the dogs, and was scarcely a minute
out of sight. The hearts, &amp;c., were eaten
by many respectable people who attended the
hunt, and allowed to be very delicious; the
carcasses were also eaten by the men employed,
and found to be excellent; what is a little extraordinary,
the account does not state that
the partakers of this hard-earned fare were
Carthusians.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, I remarked the occurrence
which the commander noticed. The fish, which
upon our first arrival had risen merrily at the
natural flies, ceased on a sudden altogether—now
they rushed confusedly through the water,
or threw themselves for yards along the surface.
It was not the sullen plunge at an insect,
or the vertical spring, when sport, not
food, brings the salmon over water; but it was
evident that there was some hidden cause of
alarm, and we were not long left in doubt.
Near the neck of the pool, an otter of the
largest size showed himself for a moment, then
darting under water, the same commotion ensued
again. Before a minute elapsed, Andy
Bawn pointed silently to a shoal beneath an
overhanging bush, and there was the spoiler,
apparently resting himself after his successful
exertions, and holding a four-pound white-trout
in his mouth. Either he noticed us, or
had some more favourite haunt to feed in, for
he glided into the deep water, and we saw no
more of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although we found out that the otter and
ourselves could not manage to fish in company,
we ascertained that the pool was abundantly
stocked with salmon:—during the period of
the greatest alarm, at least half a dozen fish
were breaking the surface at the same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>A curious incident, however, supplied us
with an excellent white fish. The servant
who brought the post bag, when in the act of
crossing the river, which in his route from the
lodge he was obliged to do repeatedly, most
unexpectedly encountered a large otter carrying
off a salmon he had just seized. The
postman attacked the poacher vigorously, who,
dropping his prey, glided off into the deep water
at the tail of the ford. The spoil proved to
be a fresh salmon not twenty hours from the
sea, and consequently in prime condition. The
otter showed himself the best artist of the day,
for while the Colonel and his companion returned
with empty baskets, the little animal
managed to secure the finest and freshest salmon
in the river.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The otter hound is a mixed breed between
the hardy southern hound and the large rough
terrier. His head is large and broad, his ears
long and pendulous; he is in size betwixt the
harrier and the fox hound; is thick quartered
and shouldered; his hair strong and wiry, and
somewhat shaggy. He is a bold and fierce
dog, and has a full and harmonious voice.
He is usually sandy-coloured on the back,
the sides, and the neck, with the lower parts
white; he carries his tail, which is rough, in
the manner of a fox-hound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Otter hunting, during the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, was a favourite amusement amongst
the young gentry of Great Britain, at which
period that animal was much more numerous
than at the present time, being greatly reduced
since population became more dense,
and gamekeepers more generally used, who
employ all kinds of traps and gins to destroy
them. Cultivation has also contributed to
lessen this destructive creature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Otter hounds were kept in small packs of
from six to sixteen, seldom exceeding that
number. The sport of otter hunting is now
little understood, and is quite on the decline
in this country.</p>

treated, a tread is seldom productive of much
injury. If the dirt be well washed out of it,
and a pledget of tow dipped in Friar’s balsam
be bound over the wound, it will, in the majority
of cases, speedily heal. Should the
bruise be extensive, or the wound deep, a
poultice may be applied for one or two days,
and then the Friar’s balsam, or digestive ointment.
Sometimes a soft tumour will form on
the part, which will be quickly brought to
suppuration by a poultice, and when the matter
has run out the ulcer will heal by the application
of the Friar’s balsam, or a weak solution
of blue vitriol.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The owl is distinguished, among birds of
the rapacious kind, by peculiar and striking
characters; its outward appearance is not
more singular than its habits and dispositions.
Unable to bear the brighter light of
the sun, the owl retires to some lonely retreat,
where it passes the day in silence and
obscurity; but on the approach of evening, when
all nature is desirous of repose, and the smaller
animals, which are its principal food, are seeking
their nestling places, the owl comes forth
from its lurking holes in quest of its prey.
Its eyes are admirably adapted for this purpose,
being so formed as to distinguish objects
with greater facility in the dusk than in
broad day-light. Its flight is low and silent
during its nocturnal excursions, and when it
rests, it is then only known by its frightful
and reiterated cries, with which it interrupts
the silence of the night. During the day, the
owl is seldom seen, but, if forced from his
retreat, his flight is broken and interrupted,
and he is sometimes attended by numbers of
small birds of various kinds, who, seeing his
embarrassment, pursue him with incessant
cries, and torment him with their movements:
the jay, the thrush, the blackbird, the red-breast,
and the titmouse, all assemble to
hurry and perplex him. During all this, the
owl remains perched upon the branch of a
tree, and answers them only with awkward
and insignificant gestures, turning his head,
eyes, and body, with all the appearance of
mockery and affectation. All the species of
owls, however, are not alike dazzled and
confused with the light of the sun; some of
them being able to fly, and see distinctly in
open day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nocturnal birds of prey are generally divided
into two kinds—that which hath horns
or ears, and that which is earless or without
horns. These horns consist of small tufts of
feathers, standing up like ears on each side of
the head, which are erected or depressed at
the pleasure of the animal; and in all probability
are of use in directing the organs of
hearing, which are very large, to their proper
object. Both kinds agree in having their
eyes so formed as to be able to pursue their
prey with much less light than other birds.
The general character of the owl is as follows:—The
eyes are large, and are surrounded
with a radiated circle of feathers, of which the
eye itself is the centre; the beak and talons
are strong and crooked; the body very short,
but thick, and well covered with a coat of
the softest and most delicate plumage; the
external edges of the outer quill feathers in
general are finely fringed, which adds greatly
to the smoothness and silence of its flight.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Great-eared Owl.</i> (<i>Strix Bubo</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Grand Duc</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird
is not much inferior in size to an eagle. Its
head is very large, and is adorned with two
tufts, more than two inches long, which stand
just above each eye, its bill is strong and
much hooked; the eyes large, and of a bright
yellow; the whole plumage is of a rusty
brown, finely variegated with black and yellow
lines, spots, and specks; its belly is ribbed
with bars of brown colour, confusedly intermixed;
its tail is short, marked with
dusky bars; its legs are strong, and covered
to the claws with a thick close down, of a
rust colour; its claws are large, much hooked,
and of a dusky colour. Its nest is large,
being nearly three feet in diameter; it is
composed of sticks bound together by fibrous
roots, and lined with leaves. It generally
lays two eggs, somewhat larger than those of
a hen, and variegated like the bird itself.
The young ones are very voracious, and are
well supplied with various kinds of food by
the parents. This bird has been found,
though rarely, in Great Britain; it builds its
nest in the caverns of rocks, in mountains,
and almost inaccessible places, and is seldom
seen on the plains, or perched on trees; it
feeds on young hares, rabbits, rats, mice, and
reptiles of various kinds.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Long-eared Owl.</i> (<i>Horn Owl</i>,
<i>Strix Otus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Hibou</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Its
length is fourteen inches; breadth, somewhat
more than three feet. Its bill is black; irides
of a bright yellow; the radiated circle round
each eye is of a light cream colour, in some
parts tinged with red; between the bill and
the eye there is a circular streak, of a dark
brown colour; another circle of a dark rusty
brown entirely surrounds the face; its horns
or ears consist of six feathers, closely laid
together, of a dark brown colour, tipped and
edged with yellow; the upper part of the
body is beautifully pencilled with fine streaks
of white, rusty, and brown; the breast and
neck are yellow, finely marked with dusky
streaks, pointing downwards; the belly, thighs,
and vent feathers are of a light cream colour;
upon each wing there are four or five large
white spots; the quill and tail feathers are
marked with dusky and reddish bars: the
legs are feathered down to the claws, which
are very sharp; the outer claw is movable,
and may be turned backwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is common in various parts of Europe,
as well as in this country; its usual
haunts are in old ruined buildings, in rocks,
and in hollow trees. M. Buffon observes, that
it seldom constructs a nest of its own, but not
unfrequently occupies that of the magpie: it
lays four or five eggs; the young are at first
white, but acquire their natural colour in about
fifteen days.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Short-eared Owl.</i> (<i>Strix Brachyotus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Phil. Trans.</span> vol. 62, p. 384.)—Length
fourteen inches; breadth three feet. The head
is small, and hawklike; bill dusky; the irides
are of a bright yellow, and when the pupil is
contracted, shine like gold; the circle round
each eye is of a dirty white, with dark streaks
pointing outwards; immediately round the eye
there is a circle of black; the two horns or
ears consist of not more than three feathers,
of a pale brown or tawny colour, with a dark
streak in the middle of each; the whole upper
part of the body is variously marked with dark
brown and tawny, the feathers are mostly edged
with the latter; the breast and belly are of a
pale yellow, marked with dark longitudinal
streaks, which are most numerous on the breast:
the legs and feet are covered with feathers of
a pale yellow colour; the claws are much
hooked and black: the wings are long, and
extend beyond the tail; the quills are marked
with alternate bars of a dusky and pale brown;
the tail is likewise marked with bars of the
same colours, and the middle feathers are distinguished
by a dark spot in the centre of the
yellow space; the tip is white. Of several of
these birds, both male and female, with which
this work has been favoured, both sexes had
the upright tufts or ears: in one which was
alive, they were very conspicuous, and appeared
more erect while the bird remained undisturbed;
but, when frightened, were scarcely
to be seen: in the dead birds they were hardly
descernible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Pennant seems to be the first describer
of this rare and beautiful species, which he
supposes to be a bird of passage, as it only visits
us in the latter part of the year, and disappears
in the spring. It flies by day, and
sometimes is seen in companies: twenty eight
were once counted in a turnip-field in November.
It is found chiefly in wooded or mountainous
countries: its food is principally field-mice.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Female Horned Owl.</i>—This bird is
somewhat larger than the former; the colours
and marks were the same, but much darker,
and the spots on the breast larger and more
numerous; the ears were not discernible.
Being a dead bird, and having not seen any
other at the time, the editors suppose it to be
a distinct kind; but having since seen several
both males and females, they are convinced of
the mistake.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The White Owl</i>, <i>Barn Owl</i>, <i>Church Owl</i>,
<i>Gillihowt</i>, <i>Screech Owl</i>, (<i>Strix Flammea</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>L’Effraie, ou, La Fresaie</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Length
fourteen inches. Bill pale horn colour;
eyes dark; the radiated circle round the
eye is composed of feathers of the most delicate
softness, and perfectly white; the head,
back, and wings, are of a pale chestnut, beautifully
powdered with very fine grey and brown
spots, intermixed with white; the breast, belly,
and thighs, are white; on the former are a few
dark spots: the legs are feathered down to the
toes, which are covered with short hairs; the
wings extend beyond the tail, which is short,
and marked with alternate bars of dusky and
white; the claws are white. Birds of this
kind vary considerably: of several which were
in the hands of the editors, the differences were
very conspicuous, the colours being more or
less faint according to the age of the bird; the
breast in some was white, without spots, in
others pale yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The white owl is well known, and is often
seen in the most populous towns, frequenting
churches, old houses, maltings, and other uninhabited
buildings, where it continues during
the day, and leaves its haunts in the twilight
in quest of its prey. It has obtained the name
of screech owl from its cries, repeated at intervals,
and rendered loud and frightful from the
stillness of the night. During its repose it
makes a blowing noise, resembling the snoring
of a man. It makes no nest, but deposits its
eggs in the holes of walls, and lays five or six,
of a whitish colour. It feeds on mice and
small birds, which it swallows whole, and afterwards
emits the bones, feathers, and other
indigestible parts, at its mouth, in the form of
small round cakes, which are often found in the
empty buildings it frequents.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Tawny Owl</i>, <i>Common Brown Ivy
Owl</i>, or <i>Howlet</i>. (<i>Strix stridula</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>Le Chat-huant</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This bird is about
the size of the last. Its bill is white; eyes
dark blue; the radiated feathers round the
eyes are white, finely streaked with brown;
the head, neck, back, wing coverts, and scapulars,
are of a tawny brown colour, finely powdered
and spotted with dark brown and black;
on the wing coverts and scapulars are several
large white spots, regularly placed so as to
form three rows; the quill feathers are marked
with alternate bars of light and dark brown;
the breast and belly are of a pale yellow,
marked with narrow dark streaks pointing
downwards, and crossed with others of the
same colour; the legs are feathered down to
the toes; the claws are large, much hooked,
and white. This species is found in various
parts of Europe; it frequents woods, and
builds its nest in the hollows of trees.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Little Owl.</i> (<i>Strix passerina</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Chevêche, ou Petite Chouette</i>,
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This is the smallest of the owl kind,
not being larger than a blackbird. Its bill is
brown at the base, and of a yellow colour at
the tip; eyes pale yellow; the circular feathers
on the face are white, tipped with black;
the upper part of the body is of an olive
brown colour; the top of the head and wing
coverts are spotted with white; the breast and
belly white, spotted with brown; the feathers
of the tail are barred with rust colour and
brown, and tipped with white; the legs are
covered with down of a rusty colour mixed
with white; the toes and claws are of a
brownish colour. It frequents rocks and
caverns and ruined buildings, and builds its
nest, which is constructed in the rudest manner,
in the most retired places; it lays five
eggs, spotted with white and yellow. It sees
better in the day time than other nocturnal
birds, and gives chase to swallows and other
small birds on the wing; it likewise feeds on
mice, which it tears in pieces with its bill and
claws, and swallows them by morsels; it is
said to pluck the birds which it kills before it
eats them, in which it differs from the other
owls. It is rarely met with in England; it
is sometimes found in Yorkshire, Flintshire,
and in the neighbourhood of London.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Having some acquaintance with a tame
brown owl, I find that it casts up the fur of
mice, and the feathers of birds in pellets, after
the manner of hawks; when full, like a dog,
it hides what it cannot eat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young of the barn-owl are not easily
raised, as they want a constant supply of fresh
mice: whereas the young of the brown owl
will eat indiscriminately all that is brought;
snails, rats, kittens, puppies, magpies, and any
kind of carrion or offal.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>White’s

<p class='c006'><i>The Owlery at Arundel Castle.</i>—We
were unwilling to leave this venerable castle
without the sight of the owls, which are said
to be the finest in Great Britain. We were
introduced to an utterly ruined part of the
ancient castle, where, upon entering the inclosure,
we saw a number of these strange
looking creatures, hopping about with an ungraceful
gait, and staring at us with looks of
wonderful sagacity. One stood at the mouth
of a subterraneous excavation, and upon the
keeper pronouncing “bow, wow,” the owl
instantly returned the expression, retiring at
the same time back again into his hole, till it
actually got out of sight. The other owls
were driven by the keeper into one corner of
the yard; they ranged themselves along a
piece of old timber, altogether presenting a
spectacle which raised in my mind some singular
emotions. The countenance of the
largest of them was marked by an unusual
degree of solemnity.</p>

<p class='c006'>These owls are the finest of the horned
kind, and the keeper showed no small pride in
the exhibition of them. “Beauty, Beauty,”
was the name by which he called them together,
and they seemed to recognise the propriety
of the appellation with a becoming
consciousness. Upon the justness of this
term, however, the keeper and myself were
by no means agreed.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the sight of the owls, they
are so overpowered by the brightness of the
day, that they are obliged to remain in the
same spot without stirring; and when they
are forced to leave their retreat, their flight is
tardy and interrupted, being afraid of striking
against the intervening obstacles. The other
birds, perceiving their constrained situation,
delight to insult them: the titmouse, the
finch, the redbreast, the jay, the thrush, &amp;c.
assemble to enjoy the sport. The bird of
night remains perched upon a branch, motionless
and confounded; hears their cries, which
are incessantly repeated, but it answers them
only with insignificant gestures, turning round
its head and its body with a foolish air. It
even suffers itself to be assaulted without
making resistance; the smallest, the weakest
of its enemies, are the most eager to torment
and turn it into ridicule. The keep in which
the owls are shown is an undoubted remnant
of the original Saxon building, and well worth
the attention of the antiquary.</p>

<p class='c006'>This owlery is thus spoken of by another
visiter: “The owls, which are still to be seen,
are uncommonly elegant birds, and extremely
large, some of them measuring across the
wings, when extended, from eight to ten feet.
Their plumage is particularly beautiful, and
their eyes brilliant. The late duke procured
them from North America.”—<i>Evans.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The natural history of the samlet, or par,
is very doubtful. Some assert it to be a mule
produced by the salmon and trout, and as a
corroboration of this theory, it is stated that
the rivers where the par is found are always
resorted to by salmon. Others conjecture it
to be a hybrid of the sea and river trout; and
Sir Humphry Davy mentions, that fishing in
October, in a small stream communicating with
the Moy, near Ballina, he caught a number of
sea trout, who all proved males, and accordingly
infers that “these fish, in which the spermatic
system was fully developed, could only have
impregnated the ova of the common river trout.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The par differs from the small mountain
trout in colour, and in having additional spines
in the pectoral fin. It has also certain olive-bluish
marks upon the side, similar to impressions
made by the pressure of a man’s
fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Great numbers of samlet are found in the
upper streams of the Ballycroy river. They
will rise voraciously at a fly, provided it be
gay and small enough. I remember my friend
Sir Charles Cuyler and I amused ourselves
on a blank shooting day, when there was
neither a sufficiency of wind nor water to
warrant salmon fishing, in angling for this hybridous
diminutive. We nearly filled our
basket; we reckoned them, and they amounted
to above two hundred.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p>THE PARTRIDGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of this bird is about thirteen
inches. The bill is light brown; eyes hazel;
the general colour of its plumage is brown
and ash, elegantly mixed with black; each
feather is streaked down the middle with buff
colour; the sides of the head are tawny;
under each eye there is a small saffron-coloured
spot, which has a granulated appearance,
and between the eye and the ear a
naked skin of a bright scarlet, which is not
very conspicuous but in old birds; on the
breast there is a crescent of a deep chestnut
colour; the tail is short; the legs are of a
greenish white; and are furnished with a small
knob behind. The female has no crescent on
the breast, and her colours in general are not
so distinct and bright as those of the male.
Partridges are found chiefly in temperate climates;
the extremes of heat and cold are
equally unfavourable to them, they are nowhere
in greater plenty than in this island,
where, in their season, they contribute to our
most elegant entertainments. It is much to
be lamented, however, that the means taken to
preserve this valuable bird should, in a variety
of instances, prove its destruction: the proper
guardians of the eggs and young ones, tied down
by ungenerous restrictions, are led to consider
them as a growing evil, and not only connive
at their destruction, but too freely assist in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Partridges pair early in the spring; the female
lays from fourteen to eighteen, or twenty
eggs, making her nest of dry leaves and grass
upon the ground. The young birds learn to
run as soon as hatched, frequently encumbered
with part of the shell sticking to them. It is
no uncommon thing to introduce partridges’
eggs under the common hen, who hatches and
rears them as her own, in this case the young
birds require to be fed with ants’ eggs, which
are their favourite food, and without which
it is almost impossible to bring them up; they
likewise eat insects, and when full grown, feed
on all kinds of grain and young plants. The
affection of the partridge for her young is peculiarly
strong and lively; she is greatly assisted
in the care of rearing them by her mate;
they lead them out in common, call them together,
point out to them their proper food,
and assist them in finding it by scratching the
ground with their feet; they frequently sit
close to each other, covering the chickens with
their wings like the hen. In this situation
they are not easily flushed; the sportsman,
who is attentive to the preservation of his game,
will carefully avoid giving any disturbance to
a scene so truly interesting, but should the
pointer come too near, or unfortunately run in
upon them, there are few who are ignorant of
the confusion that follows; the male first gives
the signal of alarm by a peculiar cry of distress,
throwing himself at the same moment more
immediately into the way of danger. In order
to deceive or mislead the enemy he flies, or
rather runs, along the ground, hanging his
wings, and exhibiting every symptom of debility,
whereby the dog is decoyed, in the too eager
expectation of an easy prey, to a distance from
the covey; the female flies off in a contrary
direction and to a greater distance, but returning
soon after by secret ways, she finds her
scattered brood closely squatted among the
grass, and collecting them with haste she leads
them from the danger, before the dog has had
time to return from his pursuit. <i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Shooting</span>.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A hen partridge came out of a ditch, and ran
along shivering with her wings, and crying out
as if wounded and unable to get from us.
While the dam acted this distress, the boy who
attended me saw her brood, which was small and
unable to fly, run for shelter into an old fox-earth
under the bank. So wonderful a power
is instinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not uncommon to see an old partridge
feign itself wounded, and run along on the
ground fluttering and crying before either dog
or man, to draw them away from its helpless
unfledged young ones. I have seen it often,
and once in particular I saw a remarkable instance
of the old bird’s solicitude to save its
brood. As I was hunting with a young pointer,
the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges;
the old bird cried, fluttered, and ran tumbling
along just before the dog’s nose till she had
drawn him to a considerable distance, when
she took wing and flew still farther off, but
not out of the field: on this the dog returned
to me, near the place the young ones lay
concealed in the grass, which the old bird no
sooner perceived than she flew back again to
us, settled just before the dog’s nose again, and
by rolling and tumbling about drew off his
attention from her young, and thus preserved
her brood a second time. I have also seen,
when a kite has been hovering over a covey
of young partridges, the old birds fly up at the
bird of prey, screaming and fighting with all
their might to preserve their brood.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Partridges manifest great caution in choosing
the place where they intend having their
nest. I have observed them to remain near
the same spot for some weeks before the female
lays her eggs; and if in the mean time
they should discover the retreat of any animal
in the neighbourhood, who is likely to be injurious
to them, they shift their quarters. I
have generally noticed that partridges lodge
themselves at night near the middle of a field,
probably being aware that they are safer in this
situation from the attacks of stoats or weasels,
than if they got nearer hedges, under the roots
or banks of which these animals conceal themselves.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>White of Selborne</i>—<i>Markwick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Passerine Order</span>, <i>s.</i> Birds of the sparrow tribe.</p>

<p class='c006'>This numerous class constitutes the fifth
order in Mr. Pennant’s arrangement of British
birds, and includes a great variety of different
kinds: of these we have detached the stare,
the thrush, and the chatterer, and have joined
them to the pies, to which they seem to have
a greater affinity. Those which follow are distinguished
by their lively and active disposition,
their beautiful plumage, and delightful melody.
Of this order consist those amazing flocks of
small birds of almost every description—those
numerous families, which universally diffused
throughout every part of the known world,
people the woods, the fields, and even the
largest and most populous cities, in countless
multitudes, and every where enliven, diversify,
and adorn the face of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters of the Passerine order,
which are as various as their habits and dispositions,
will be best seen in the description of
each particular species. It may be necessary,
however, to observe, that they naturally divide
themselves into two distinct kinds, namely,
the hard-billed or seed birds, and the slender
or soft-billed birds; the former are furnished
with stout bills of a conical shape, and very
sharp at the point, admirably fitted for the
purpose of breaking the hard external coverings
of the seeds of plants from their kernels,
which constitute the principal part of their food;
the latter are remarkable for the softness and
delicacy of their bills; their food consists altogether
of small worms, insects, the larvæ of
insects, and their eggs, which they find deposited
in immense profusion on the leaves
and bark of trees, in chinks and crevices of
stones, and even in small masses on the bare
ground, so that there is hardly a portion of
matter that does not contain a plentiful supply
of food for this diligent race of beings.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Peacock</span>, <i>s.</i> A fowl eminent for the beauty of his feathers, and particularly
of his tail.</p>

<p class='c006'>The peacock and peahen are always kept by
the London dealers, whence any person in the
country, desirous of breeding them, may be
supplied with breeding stock. Exclusive of
the consideration of ornament to a poultry-yard,
the peacock is very useful for the destruction
of all kinds of reptiles, but at the
same time some peacocks are said to be vicious,
and apt to tear to pieces and devour young
chicks and ducklings, suffered to be within
their reach. They are also destructive in a
garden.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is asserted by the ancient writers, that
the first peacock was honoured with a public
exhibition at Athens; that many people travelled
thither from Macedonia, to be spectators
of that beautiful phenomenon, the paragon of
the feathered race. It is probable the ancients,
as well as the moderns, introduced the peacock
upon the table, rather as an ornament
than a viand. There are varieties of this bird,
some white: they perch on trees, like the
turkey. Their age extends to twenty years,
and at three, the tail of the cock is full and
complete. The cock requires from two to
four hens, and, where the country agrees with
them, they are very prolific. They are granivorous
like other domestic fowls, preferring
barley.—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Peck</span>, <i>s.</i> The fourth part of a bushel; the stroke of a bird’s bill.</p>

is supposed to admit its young to suck blood from its breast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_377.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The bill of this genus is long and straight;
the end either hooked or sloping; the nostrils
placed in a furrow that runs along the sides of
the bill, and in most of the species not distinguishable.
The face generally destitute of
feathers, being covered only with a bare skin:
gullet naked, and capable of great distension:
body long, heavy, flat: legs placed far backward;
toes four in number, and all webbed
together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Latham, following the example of Linnæus,
includes the pelican, man-of-war bird, cormorant,
shag, gannet, and booby, in this genus,
of which he enumerates thirty distinct species,
and two varieties; four only of this number,
and one variety, are British birds. In confining
the present account to these, it is proper to
remark that they are not the inhabitants of
this country only, but are widely dispersed
over the globe, being met with in almost every
climate which navigators have visited, whether
temperate, hot, or cold. The gannet only is
migratory, large flocks of this species arrive in
the spring of the year, and disperse themselves
in colonies over the rocky promontories of
Scotland, and its isles, in various parts of
which they breed and rear their young, and as
soon as that office is performed, they retire in
the autumn to their unknown abodes. Their
return each season points out also that of the
shoals of the herrings, which they hover over,
pursue, and chiefly feed upon. These shoals,
at that season of increasing warmth, are poured
forth on their southern route, gliding forward
in wide glittering columns of myriads upon
myriads, from the unknown but prolific regions
of the northern pole. These prodigious shoals
with their divisions and subdivisions, in their
branched course around the British isles, are
attended by the gannet. On our southern
coasts the pilchard affords these birds another
supply of food, in pursuit of which they are
enticed as far southward as the Mediterranean
sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cormorant and the shag remain with us
throughout the year, but particularly on our
more northern shores, upon whose rocky shelving
precipices they station themselves, and perform
the offices of incubation, while stragglers
occasionally taking a wider range, with outstretched
neck and vigorous wing sweep along
the coast, and entering the mouths of the rivers,
follow their course in quest of food, to
the lakes inland.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pellet</span>, <i>s.</i> A little ball; a bullet, a ball.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Perch</span>, <i>s.</i> A measure of five yards and a half; a pole; something on which
birds roost or sit; a kind of fish peculiar to ponds and rivers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_378.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Perch have one particularity, which is contrary
to the nature of all fish of prey in fresh
water (and they are so voracious as to attack
their own kind), that they are gregarious,
swimming in shoals. The body of the perch
is deep, the scales very rough, the back much
arched, and the side-line approaches near it:
the irides are golden, the teeth small, disposed
in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth,
which is large; the edges of the cover of the
gills serrated, on the lower end of the largest
in a sharp spine, and the head is said to consist
of no fewer than eighty bones; the colours
of the perch are beautiful, the back and part
of the sides being of a deep green, marked with
broad black bars pointing downwards; the belly
is white, tinged red; the ventral fins of a rich
scarlet; the anal fins and tail (which is a little
forked,) of the same colour but rather paler.</p>

<p class='c006'>The perch affords the angler great diversion,
and not only the baits are various, but the
modes of using them. Of worms, the best
kinds are small lob-worms which have no knot,
brandlings, red dunghills, or those found in
rotten tan, all well scoured; the hook may be
varied from No. 2 to 6, being well whipt
to a strong silk-worm gut, with a shot or two
a foot from it: put the point of the hook in at
the head of the worm, out again a little lower
than the middle, pushing it above the shank of
the hook upon the gut; take a smaller one,
beginning the same way, and bring its head up
to the middle of the shank only; then draw
the first worm down to the head of the latter,
so that the tails may hang one above the other,
keeping the point of the hook well covered.
This is the most enticing method that can be
adopted in worm-fishing; use a small cork
float, to keep the bait at six or twelve inches
from the bottom, or sometimes about midwater:
in angling near the bottom, raise the
bait very frequently from thence almost to the
surface, letting it gradually fall again. Should
a good shoal be met with, they are so greedy,
that they may be all caught, unless one escapes
that has felt the hook: then all is over, the fish
that has been hooked becomes restless, and
soon occasions the whole shoal to leave the
place. Two or three rods may be employed,
as they require time to gorge sufficient to allow
the angler to be prepared to strike them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Baits for the perch are loaches, sticklebacks,
with the spines cut off, miller’s-thumbs, horse-beans
boiled (after the place has been well-baited
with them, put one at a time on the
hook), cad-bait, bobs, and gentles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although generally termed a bold biter, the
perch is extremely abstemious in winter, and
scarcely ever bites in that season, but in the
middle of a warm sunshiny day; he bites
best in the latter part of the spring, from seven
to eleven in the forenoon, and from two to six
in the afternoon, except in hot and bright
weather, and then from sunrise to six in the
morning, and in the eve from six to sunset. If
a day be cool and cloudy, with a ruffling south
wind, perch will bite during the whole of it.
In clear water, sometimes a dozen or more of
perch have been observed in a deep hole, sheltered
by trees or bushes; by using fine tackle
and a well-scoured worm, the angler may see
them strive which shall first seize it, until the
whole shoal have been caught.</p>

<p class='c006'>The perch may be angled for and taken
until the end of September, and indeed at particular
times all the year round; but the preferable
season is from the beginning of May, to
the middle of July.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Mr. Young mentions that, at Pakenham,
Lord Longford informed him respecting the
quantities of fish in the lakes in his neighbourhood,
that the perch were so numerous, that a
child with a packthread and a crooked pin
would catch enough in an hour for the daily
use of a whole family, and that his lordship had
seen five hundred children fishing at the same
time; that, besides perch, the lakes produced
pike five feet long, and trout of ten pounds
each.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Great numbers of perch are bred in the
Hampton Court and Bushy Park ponds, all of
which are well supplied with running water,
and with plenty of food, yet they seldom arrive
at a large size. In a neighbouring pond,
which is only fed with drainage water, I have
caught very large perch. The perch in the
water in the Regent’s Park are very numerous.
Those I have taken, however, are almost invariably
of one size, from half to three-quarters
of a pound. Why they should have arrived
at this weight and not go on increasing in size,
is a circumstance which it is not easy to account
for. I have, however, remarked it to
be the case in other ponds.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Wild

<img src='images/i_379.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The pheasant is rather less than the common
cock. The bill is of a pale horn colour;
the nostrils are hid under an arched covering;
the eyes are yellow, and surrounded by a
space, in appearance like beautiful scarlet cloth,
finely spotted with black; immediately under
each eye there is a small patch of short feathers
of a dark glossy purple; the upper parts
of the head and neck are of a deep purple,
varying to glossy green and blue; the lower
parts of the neck and breast are of a reddish
chestnut, with black indented edges; the sides
and lower parts of the breast are of the same
colour, with pretty large tips of black to each
feather, which in different lights vary to a
glossy purple; the belly and vent are dusky;
the back and scapulars are beautifully variegated
with black and white or cream-colour
speckled with black, and mixed with deep
orange, all the feathers are edged with black;
on the lower part of the back there is a mixture
of green; the quills are dusky, freckled with
white, wing coverts brown, glossed with green
and edged with white; rump plain reddish
brown; the two middle feathers of the tail are
about twenty inches long, the shortest on each
side less than five, of a reddish brown colour,
marked with transverse bars of black; the
legs are dusky, with a short blunt spur on each,
but in some old birds the spurs are as sharp as
needles; between the toes there is a strong
membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is less, and does not exhibit
that variety and brilliancy of colours which
distinguish the male; the general colours are
light and dark brown, mixed with black, the
breast and belly finely freckled with small
black spots on a light ground; the tail is short,
and barred somewhat like that of the male;
the space round the eye is covered with feathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ring pheasant is a fine variety of this
species; its principal difference consists in a
white ring, which encircles the lower part of
the neck; the colours of the plumage in general
are likewise more distinct and vivid. A
fine specimen of this bird was sent us by the
Rev. William Turner, of Newcastle, from
which the figure was engraven. They are
sometimes met with in the neighbourhood of
Alnwick, whither they were brought by his
grace the Duke of Northumberland. That
they intermix with the common breed is very
obvious, as in some we have seen the ring was
hardly visible, and in others a few feathers
only, marked with white, appeared on each
side of the neck, forming a white spot. It is
much to be regretted that this beautiful breed
is likely soon to be destroyed, by those who
pursue every species of game with an avaricious
and indiscriminating rapacity.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are many varieties of pheasants of extraordinary
beauty and brilliancy of colours;
in many gentlemen’s woods there is a kind as
white as snow, which will intermix with the
common ones. Many of the gold and silver
kinds, brought from China, are also kept in
aviaries in this kingdom; the common pheasant
is likewise a native of the East, and is the
only one of its kind that has multiplied in our
island. Pheasants are generally found in low
woody places, on the borders of plains, where
they delight to sport; during the night they
perch on the branches of trees. They are very
shy birds, and do not associate together, except
during the months of March and April, when
the male seeks the female; they are then
easily discoverable by the noise which they
make in crowing and clapping their wings,
which may be heard at some distance. The
hen breeds on the ground like the partridge,
and lays from twelve to fifteen eggs, which are
smaller than those of the common hen; the
young follow the mother as soon as they are
freed from the shell. During the breeding
season the cocks will sometimes intermix with
the common hen, and produce a hybrid breed,
of which we have known several instances.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>For shooting pheasants it often becomes necessary
to start very early in the morning, as
they are apt to lie during the day in high covert,
where it is almost impossible to shoot
them till the leaf has fallen from the trees.
We can never be at a loss in knowing where
to go for pheasants, as we have only to send
some one the previous evening, for the last
hour before sun-set, to watch the different
barley or oat stubbles of a woodland country,
and on these will be regularly displayed the
whole contents of the neighbouring coverts.
It then remains to be chosen, which woods are
the best calculated to shoot in; and, when we
begin beating them, it must be remembered
to draw the springs, so as to intercept the birds
from the old wood. If the coverts are wet,
the hedge-rows will be an excellent beginning,
provided we here also attend well to getting
between the birds and their places of security.
If pheasants, when feeding, are approached by
a man, they generally run into covert; but if
they see a dog, they are apt to fly up.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There are very few old sportsmen but
what are aware that this is by far the most
sure method of killing pheasants, or any other
game, where they are tolerably plentiful in
covert; and although to explore and beat several
hundred acres of coppice, it becomes necessary
to have a party with spaniels, yet, on
such expeditions, we rarely hear of any one
getting much game to his own share, except
some sly old fellow, who has shirked from his
companions to the end of the wood, where the
pheasants, and particularly the cock birds, on
hearing the approach of a rabble, are all running
like a retreating army, and perhaps flying
in his face faster than he can load and fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>For one alone to get shots in a thick underwood,
a brace or two of very well broke
spaniels would, of course, be the best. But
were I obliged to stake a considerable bet
(taking one beat with another, where game
was plentiful), I should back against the sportsman
using them, one who took out a very
high couraged old pointer, that would keep
near him, and would, on being told, break his
point to dash in, and put the pheasants to
flight before they could run out of shot. This
office may be also performed by a Newfoundland
dog; but, as first getting a point would
direct the shooter where to place himself for
a fair shot, the Newfoundland dog would
always be best kept close to his heels, and
only made use of to assist in this; and particularly
for bringing the game; as we rarely
see a pointer, however expert in fetching his
birds, that can follow and find the wounded
ones half so well as the real St. John’s Newfoundland
dog.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Lord Stawell sent me from the great lodge
in the Holt a curious bird for my inspection.
It was found by the spaniels of one of his
keepers in a coppice, and shot on the wing.
The shape, air, and habit of the bird, and the
scarlet ring round the eyes, agreed well with
the appearance of a cock pheasant; but then
the head and neck, and breast and belly, were
of a glossy black: and though it weighed three
pounds three ounces and a half, the weight of
a large full-grown cock pheasant, yet there
were no signs of any spurs on the legs, as is
usual with all grown cock pheasants, who have
long ones. The legs and feet were naked of
feathers, and therefore it could be nothing of
the grouse kind. In the tail were no long bending
feathers, such as cock pheasants usually
have, and are characteristic of the sex. The
tail was much shorter than the tail of a hen
pheasant, and blunt and square at the end.
The back, wing-feathers and tail, were all of
a pale russet, curiously streaked, somewhat
like the upper parts of a hen partridge. I returned
it with my verdict, that it was probably
a spurious or hybrid hen bird, bred between
a cock pheasant and some domestic fowl.
When I came to talk with the keeper who
brought it, he told me that some pea-hens had
been known last summer to haunt the coppices
and coverts where this mule was found.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The pheasant is not a long-lived bird; but
it is probable the period of existence assigned
to it by some writers, namely, six or seven
years, is too short. The wholesomeness of
its flesh was proverbial among the old physicians;
it is of a high flavour and alkalescent
quality, and in perfection during autumn. A
young pheasant very fat is reckoned an exquisite
dainty. In a wild state, the hen lays
from eighteen to twenty eggs in a season, but
seldom more than ten in a state of confinement.
Pheasants are not to be tamed by
domestication, like other fowls; nor is the
flesh of those brought up in the house, in any
degree comparable to that of the wild pheasant:
thence they are bred at home, either
merely for show, or for the purpose of replenishing
the proprietor’s grounds, both with
regard to number or particular varieties.
However good nursing mothers in a wild
state, pheasant hens are far otherwise in the
house, whence their eggs are always hatched
at home by the common hen,—generally, at
present, by the smooth-legged bantam.</p>

<p class='c006'>The natural nest of the pheasant is composed
of dry grass and leaves, which being
provided for her in confinement she will
sometimes properly dispose. The cock is bold,
voracious, and cruel; and one which I had
many years ago, caught a canary bird which
had accidentally escaped, and was observed
with it beneath his talons, in the proper attitude
of the hawk, tearing it to pieces and
devouring it. Pheasants have been seen
preying upon a dead carcase, in company with
carrion crows; and it has been said that they
will fall upon a diseased and weak companion
of their own species, and devour it. They
feed upon all kinds of insects and vermin,
like the peacock, and are said to be particularly
greedy of toads, provided they be not
too large to swallow; whereas, according to
report, they will not touch the frog, of which
ducks are so fond. A pheasant was shot by
T. Day, Esq. of Herts, the crop of which contained
more than half a pint of that destructive
insect the wire-worm. And the number
of 1606 grains of barley were taken from the
crop of a pheasant, at Bury, in Suffolk, in
1727.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The best known varieties of the pheasant,
are the golden, the silver, the peacock or
spotted, and the common European or English,
generally brown, with a less brilliancy of
colour. Mr. Castang, however, enumerates
six distinct varieties, exclusive of the common,
as follow: the gold and silver, natives
of China, and very hardy in this country, and
good breeders. The ring-necks, natives of
Tartary, bred in China, very scarce; their
plumage very beautiful. The white and pied;
both sorts will intermix readily with our common
breed, as will the Bohemian, one of the
most beautiful of its kind, and equally scarce.
The golden variety is generally of the highest
price, the common most hardy and of the
largest size.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Breeding Pheasants.</i>—Eggs being provided,
put them under a hen that has kept
the nest three or four days; and if you set
two or three nests on the same day, you will
have the advantage of shifting the good eggs.
At the end of ten or twelve days, throw away
those that are bad, and set the same hen or
hens again, if sitting hens should not be
plenty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hens having sat their full time, such
of the young pheasants as are already hatched
put into a basket, with a piece of flannel, till
the hen has done hatching.</p>

<p class='c006'>The brood, now come, put under a frame
with a net over it, and a place for the hen,
that she cannot get to the young pheasants,
but that they may go to her: and feed them
with boiled egg cut small, boiled milk and
bread, alum curd, ants’ eggs, a little of each
sort, and often.</p>

<p class='c006'>After two or three days, they will be acquainted
with the call of the hen that hatched
them, may have their liberty of running on
the grass-plot, or elsewhere, observing to shift
them with the sun, and out of the cold winds.
They should not have their liberty in the
morning till the sun is up; and they must be
shut in with the hen in good time in the
evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every thing now going on properly, you
must be very careful (in order to guard against
the distemper to which they are liable) in
your choice of a situation for breeding the
birds up; and be less afraid of foxes, dogs,
pole-cats, and all sorts of vermin, than the
<i>distemper</i>. I had rather encounter all the
former than the latter; for those, with care,
may be prevented, but the distemper, once
got in, is like the plague, and destroys all
your hopes. What I mean by a good situation,
is nothing more than a place where no
poultry, pheasants, or turkeys, &amp;c. have ever
been kept; such as the warm side of a field,
orchard, pleasure-ground, or garden, or even
on a common, or a good green lane, under
circumstances of this kind; or by a wood-side;
but then it is proper for a man to keep
with them under a temporary hovel, and to
have two or three dogs chained at a proper
distance, with a lamp or two at night. I have
known a great number of pheasants bred up
in this manner, in the most exposed situations.
It is proper for the man always to have a gun,
that he may keep off the hawks, owls, jays,
magpies, &amp;c. The dogs and lamps intimidate
the foxes beyond any other means; and the
dogs will give tongue for the man to be on
his guard if smaller vermin are near, or when
strollers make their appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The birds going on as before mentioned,
should so continue till December, or, if very
early bred, the middle of August. Before
they begin to shift the long feathers in the
tail, they are to be shut up in the basket with
the hen, regularly every night; and when
they begin to shift their tail the birds are
large, and begin to lie out, that is, they are
not willing to come to be shut up in the basket.
Those that are intended to be turned
out wild should be taught to perch (a situation
they have never been used to); this is
done by tying a string to the hen’s leg, and
obliging her to sit in a tree all night: be sure
you put her in the tree before sun-set; and
if she falls down, you must persevere in putting
her up again, till she is contented with
her situation; then the young birds will follow
the hen, and perch with her. This being
done, and the country now covered with corn,
fruits, and shrubs, &amp;c. &amp;c. they will shift for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>For such young pheasants as you make
choice of for your breeding stock at home,
and likewise to turn out in the spring following,
provide a new piece of ground, large and
roomy, for two pens, where no pheasants, &amp;c.
have been kept, and there put your young
birds in as they begin to shift their tails.
Such of them as you intend to turn out at a
future time, or in another place, put into one
pen netted over, and leave their wings as they
are; and those you wish to keep for breeding
put into the other pen, cutting one wing of
each bird. The gold and silver pheasants
you must pen earlier, or they will be off.
Cut the wing often; and, when first penned,
feed all your young birds with barley-meal,
dough, corn, and plenty of green turnips.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>A Receipt to make Alum Curd.</i>—Take
new milk, as much as your young birds require,
and boil it with a lump of alum, so as
not to make the curd hard and tough, but
custard like.</p>

<p class='c006'>N.B.—A little of this curd twice a day,
and ants’ eggs after every time they have had
a sufficient quantity of the other food. If
they do not eat heartily, give them some ants’
eggs to create an appetite, but by no means in
such abundance as to be considered their
food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The distemper alluded to above, is not improbably
of the same nature as the roup in
chickens; contagious, and dependent on the
state of the weather; and, for prevention, requiring
similar precaution.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>General Directions.</i>—Not more than four
hens to be allowed in the pens to one cock;
and in the out covers, three hens to one cock
may be sufficient, with the view of allowing
for accidents, such as the loss of a cock or hen.
Never put more eggs under a hen than she
can well and closely cover, the eggs fresh and
carefully preserved. Short broods to be joined
and shifted to one hen. Common hen pheasants
in close pens, and with plenty of cover,
will sometimes make their nests and hatch
their own eggs, but they seldom succeed in
rearing their brood, being so naturally shy;
whence, should this method be desired, they
must be left entirely to themselves, as they
feel alarm even in being looked at. Eggs for
setting are generally ready in April. Period
of incubation the same in the pheasant as in
the common hen. Pheasants, like the pea-owl,
will clear grounds of insects and reptiles,
but will spoil all wall-trees within their reach,
by pecking off every bud and leaf.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feeding.</i>—Strict cleanliness to be observed,
the meat not to be tainted with dung, and the
water to be pure and often renewed. Ants’
eggs being scarce, hog-lice, earwigs, or any
insects, may be given; or artificial ants’ eggs
substituted, composed of flour beaten up with
an egg and shell together, the pellets rubbed
between the fingers to the proper size. After
the first three weeks, in a scarcity of ants’
eggs, Castang gives a few gentles, procured
from a good liver tied up, the gentles, when
ready, dropping into a pan or box of bran; to
be given sparingly, and not considered as common
food.</p>

<p class='c006'>Food for grown pheasants, barley or wheat;
generally the same as for other poultry. In a
cold spring, hemp-seed, or other warming
seeds, are comfortable, and will forward the
breeding stock.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>A New Species of Pheasant.</i>—Amongst
the numerous interesting natural productions
recently brought from China by Mr. Reeves,
it was with pleasure we observed a magnificent
new species of pheasant, which will be a
most interesting addition to the aviaries of Europe;
and as it comes from the same part of
the world as the gold and silver kind, there is
scarcely a doubt but that, with a little care, it
may be induced to breed in this country. It
is about three times the size of the common
pheasant, and has a tail from five to six feet
long; it is of a pale bay colour, ornamented
with black moons, and the head, wing, and
under part of the body, black varied with
white; the tail feathers are black and brown
banded. Mr. Reeves brought with him from
Canton two living specimens; but one of them
unfortunately died in the Channel; the other
is now in the gardens of the Zoological Society,
where it will most probably recover its fine
tail. A beautiful specimen, in nearly perfect
plumage, brought by Mr. Reeves for General
Hardwicke, has been presented by that gentleman
to the collection of the British Museum.
The tail feathers of this bird have been long
known, two having been exhibited in the Museum
for many years; but the bird which bore
them was first described in General Hardwick’s
Illustrations of Indian Zoology, from a drawing
sent by Mr. Reeves, where it is called
Reeves’s pheasant (<i>Phasianus Reevesii</i>).—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Hawker</i>—<i>Moubray.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Of these the varieties and intermixtures are
innumerable, and partake of all those varied
hues which are the constant result of domestication.
The manners of pigeons are well
known, few species being more universally diffused,
and having a very powerful wing, they
are enabled to perform very distant journeys;
accordingly wild and tame pigeons occur in
every climate, and although they thrive best
in warm countries, yet with care they succeed
also in very northern latitudes. Every where
their manners are gentle and lively; they are
fond of society, and the very emblem of connubial
attachment; they are faithful to their
mates, whom they solicit with the softest cooings,
the tenderest caresses, and the most
graceful movements. The exterior form of the
pigeon is beautiful and elegant: the bill is
weak straight and slender, and has a soft protuberance
at the base, in which the nostrils are
placed: the legs are short and red, and the toes
divided to the origin.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Buffon enumerates upwards of thirty varieties
of the pigeon, which, according to his
usual systematic plan—its convenience, perhaps,
being rather more obvious than its
accuracy—he derives from one root, namely,
the stock-dove, or common wild pigeon. All
the varieties of colour and form which we
witness, he attributes to human contrivance
and fancy. There exist, nevertheless, essential
specific differences in these birds, which
seem rather attributable to the nature of the
region, soil, or climate, to which they are indigenous,
than to the art of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pigeon is monogamous, that is, the
male attaches and confines himself to one
female, and the attachment is reciprocal: the
fidelity of the dove to its mate being proverbial.
Young pigeons are termed squeakers,
and begin to breed at about the age of six
months, when properly managed: their courtship,
and the well known tone of voice in the
cock, just then acquired and commencing,
are indications of their approaching union.
Nestlings, whilst fed by the cock and hen,
are termed squabs, and are at that age sold
and used for the table. The dove-house
pigeon is said to breed monthly, being well
supplied with food, more particularly when
the ground is bound by frost, or covered
with snow. At any rate, it may be depended
on, that pigeons of almost any healthy and
well established variety, will breed eight or
ten times in the year; whence it may be
conceived how immense are the quantities
which may be raised.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first step towards pigeon keeping, is,
undoubtedly, to provide a commodious place
for their reception, of which I shall afterwards
speak; the next, to provide the pigeons
themselves. These will be had in pairs, but
if not actually matched, pains must be afterwards
taken, to that end, that no time be
lost; indeed, they may be matched according
to the fancy of the keepers, for the purpose
of varying the colours, or with any other view.
But it is necessary to give a caution on the
subject of old pigeons, of which a bargain may
offer, since the difficulty of retaining them is
so great, indeed insuperable, without the
strictest vigilance. Nothing short of cutting
their wings, and confining them closely until
they have young to attach them to the place,
will be a security; and even afterwards, they
have been known to take flight with the first
use of their wings, and leave their nests. I
have had several examples of this. Thence
it is always preferable to purchase squeakers,
or such as have not yet flown: these, being
confined, in a short time, well fed, and accustomed
gradually to the surrounding scenery,
before they have acquired sufficient strength
of wing wherewith to lose themselves, will
become perfectly domesticated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dove-cote, or pigeon-loft, as to its
situation or extent, will necessarily depend
on convenience, one general rule, however,
must be invariably observed,—that every pair
of pigeons have two holes, or rooms, to nest
in. Without this indispensable convenience
there will be no security, but the prospect of
constant confusion, breaking of eggs, and
destruction of the young. Pigeons do well
near dwellings, stables, bake-houses, brew-houses,
or such offices; or their proper place
is in the poultry-court. A dove-cote is a
good object, situate upon an island, in the
centre of a piece of water: indeed, such is a
proper situation for aquatic poultry, and rabbits
also; and may be rendered extremely
beautiful and picturesque by planting, and a
little simple ornamental and useful building.
Where pigeons are kept in a room, some persons
prefer making their nests upon the floor,
to escape the danger of the young falling out;
but in all probability this is to guard against
one risk, and incur a great number, particularly
that of rats and other vermin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The front of the pigeon-room, or cote,
should have a south-west aspect; and if a
room be selected for the purpose, it is usual
to break a hole in the roof of the building for
the passage of the pigeons, which can be
closed at convenience. A platform is laid by
the carpenter at the entrance, for the pigeons
to alight and perch upon, with some kind of
defence against strange cats, which will often
depopulate a whole dove-house; cats are yet
necessary, for the defence of the pigeons
against rats and mice, as they will both destroy
the birds and suck the eggs; thence cats
of a known good breed should be trained up
familiarly with the pigeons. The platform
should be painted white, and renewed as the
paint wears off, white being a favourite
colour with pigeons, and also most conspicuous
as a mark to enable them to find their
home. The boxes also should be so coloured,
and renewed as necessary, for which purpose
lime and water will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cleanliness is one of the first and most
important considerations, the want of it in a
dove-cote will soon render the place a nuisance
not to be approached, and the birds,
both young and old, will be so covered with
vermin, and besmeared with their own excrement,
that they can enjoy no health or comfort,
and mortality is often so induced. Ours
were cleaned daily; thoroughly once a week,
a tub standing at hand for the reception of
their dung, the floor covered with sifted gravel,
often renewed. Pigeons are exceedingly
fond of water, and having a prescience of
rain, will wait its coming until late in the
evening, upon the house-top, spreading their
wings to receive the refreshing shower. When
they are confined in a room, they should be
allowed a wide pan of water, to be often
renewed, as a bath, which cools, refreshes
and assists them to keep their bodies clear of
vermin. In the attendance upon pigeons,
caution is necessary with respect to their
fighting, to which they are more prone than
might be expected, often to the destruction
of eggs or young, or driving the weakest away.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common barrel dove-cote needs no
description, at the same time it is adapted to
every situation in which it is desirable to
keep pigeons for ordinary use. To return
to the room, or loft; the shelves should be
placed sufficiently high, for security against
vermin, a small ladder being a necessary appendage.
The usual breadth of the shelves
is about twenty inches, with the allowance of
eighteen between shelf and shelf, which will
be sufficient not to incommode the tallest
pigeons. Partitions between the shelves may
be fixed at the distance of about three feet,
making a blind, by a board nailed against
the front of each partition, whence there will
be two nests in the compass of every three
feet, so that the pigeons will sit in privacy,
and not liable to be disturbed. Or a partition
may be fixed between each nest;—a good
plan, which prevents the young from running
to the hen, sitting over fresh eggs, and perhaps
occasioning her to cool and addle them,
for when the young are about a fortnight or
three weeks old, a good hen will leave them
to the care of the cock and lay again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some prefer breeding-holes entirely open
in front, for the greater convenience in cleaning
the nests; but it is from those that the
squabs are likely to fall, thence a step of sufficient
height is preferable. The tame pigeon
seldom taking the trouble to make a nest, it is
better to give her one of hay, which prevents
her eggs from rolling. Or a straw basket, or
unglazed earthen pan, may be placed in every
nest, apportioned to the size of the pigeons
you breed. A pan of three inches high,
eight inches over the top, and sloping to the
bottom like a basin, will be of sufficient size
for a tumbler, or a small pigeon, whilst one
of double those dimensions will be required
for a large runt. A brick should always be
placed in contiguity to the pan, to enable the
cock and hen to alight with greater safety
upon the eggs.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The pigeon-trap on the house-top is the
well-known contrivance of those London rascals,
who lie in wait, as has been said, to entrap
the property of others. A trap of another
description, and for a very different purpose,
is sometimes used; it is an area, on the outside
of a building, for the purpose of confining
in the air valuable breeds of pigeons which
cannot be trusted to flight. Some are erected
to the extent of twenty yards long and ten yards
in width, with shelves on every side for the
perching of the pigeons; thus they are constantly
exercised in the air, retiring at their
pleasure to the room or loft within.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Very convenient baskets are now made of
the cradle form, with partitions, or separate
apartments. They serve for the carriage of
pigeons for matching, or putting them up to
fatten, or for any of the usual purposes. I
have seen them lately, in the basket-shops on
the Greenwich road, two or three miles from
London.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Food and water should be given in such a way
as to be as little as possible contaminated with
the excrement, or any other impurity. Our
pigeons having been constantly attended, we
have never found the need of any other convenience
than earthen pans; but there have
been ingenious inventions for this purpose, of
which the meat-box and water-bottle following
are specimens. The meat-box is formed in
the shape of a hopper, covered at the top to
keep clean the grain, which descends into a
square shallow box. Some fence this with
rails or holes on each side, to keep the grain
from being scattered over; others leave it quite
open that the young pigeons may the more
easily find their food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The water-bottle is a large glass bottle, with
a long neck, holding from one to five gallons,
its belly shaped like an egg, so that the pigeons
may not light and dung upon it. It is placed
upon a stand or three-footed stool, made hollow
above, to receive the belly of the bottle,
and let the mouth into a small pan beneath:
the water will so gradually descend out of the
mouth of the bottle as the pigeons drink, and
be sweet and clean, and always stop when the
surface reaches the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>To match or pair a cock and hen, it is
necessary to shut them together, or near and
within reach of each other; and the connexion
is generally formed in a day or two. Various
rules have been laid down, by which to distinguish
the cock from the hen pigeon; but
the masculine forwardness and action of the
cock, is for the most part distinguishable.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following singular detection of a thief
occurred on a late examination at Queen
Square, Westminster:—Mr. Bepy, in the
Wandsworth road, had his pigeon-house robbed.
A known thief was stopped on the road with
six fancy pigeons in his possession, by Sergeant
Reardon of the police, and taken before the
magistrates, but no evidence appearing against
him, he was discharged, and suffered to take
away the birds, which he claimed as having
purchased them. Cooper, an officer of the
court, being somewhat up to the pigeon fancy,
and seeing them above the common sort, purchased
them, and very commendably determined
to find out the real owner, which he
effected in the following ingenious mode. Selecting
a fine bald-head, he attached a note to
its foot, with his address, and then threw up
the pigeon, which instantly flew to its own
home, and was recovered by its owner, who
returned it to Cooper, making him a present
of the half-dozen as a reward for his sagacity.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The starling is a great enemy to pigeons, by
sucking their eggs, and even destroying their
young. In October, 1800, seven hundred and
eighty starlings were taken in one night in a
dove-cot belonging to Mr. Slater, of Chalton,
near Lincoln.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In 1807, was in the possession of Mr.
Knight, of Chichester, a hen pigeon of the
pouter species, who, in that summer, hatched
three pair of young. She is twenty-one years
old, and is considered a remarkable instance
of longevity, as Buffon, and other naturalists,
have not allowed this bird, from the heat of
its nature, above eight or nine years of life,
and to be incapable of procreation after seven.</p>

<p class='c006'>The penalty for shooting them is 20<i>s.</i> for
each pigeon. (Under statute of 1 Jac. I.)</p>

<p class='c006'>For shooting at pigeons, with intent to kill,
the penalty would (by 2 Geo. II.) be the same
as for killing one pigeon, viz. 20<i>s.</i> Informations
for these offences must be commenced
within two months.</p>

<p class='c006'>In pigeon-shooting the most extraordinary
performance was by Tupor, the gamekeeper of
Sir H. Mildmay, (the same person who broke
the sow to stand to game,) who, for a considerable
wager, shot six pigeons out of ten with a
single ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tupor afterwards, to decide a bet, hit a
cricket-ball, with common shot, twelve times
successively, betwixt the wickets, bowled by
Harris, one of the sharpest bowlers in the
Hambleton Club. He is also said to have
killed swallows with a single ball.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next was effected by Mr. Elliot, at
Rudgewick, in Sussex, who undertook to kill
fifty pigeons at fifty shots; it was decided
near Petworth, at Tillington, and notwithstanding
the wind was high, he killed forty-five:
it was allowed he hit every bird, and
that he would have succeeded but for the
above circumstance. He had but one gun,
the touch-hole of which fairly melted.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Four gentlemen of Camberwell undertook,
for a wager of five guineas a side, to
shoot at twelve pigeons, and great bets were
depending, but to the mortification of the persons
present, they neither of them brought
down a single bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Keene, of Hammersmith, killed twenty
pigeons in twenty-one shots, from a trap at
the regular twenty-one yards’ distance, and in
March, 1811, he killed, in a match against
Mr. Elliot, the same number, beating his adversary
by one.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Wiltshire, the same year, Captain Hicks
shot against the gamekeeper of Mr. Maurice,
at fifteen pigeons, turned off at the same distance;
each killed the whole, and in shooting
off the ties, the former missed his sixth bird,
and lost the match, which was for two hundred
guineas.—<i>Moubray</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The pike, termed for its voracity the fresh-water
shark, is found in most of the larger
lakes and rivers of Great Britain. It grows to
an immense size—is easily produced as a pond
fish—and, being a bold determined biter,
affords excellent sport to the lovers of the art.
It is taken with natural and artificial baits, as
frogs, mice, minnows or any kind of fry; and
when the weather is favourable very little
skill is requisite to obtain abundant sport in
a well-stocked water. The best mode of
pike-fishing is trolling. <i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Trolling</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pike’s voraciousness is well known:
what is here mentioned of it is singular. In
1810, a hook baited with a roach, was set in
the manor-pond, at Toddington, Bedfordshire;
the next morning a large pike was caught,
which with difficulty was got out. It appeared
that a pike of three and a half pounds weight
was first caught, which was afterwards swallowed
by another, weighing thirteen pounds
and a half, and both were taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been before remarked, that pike are
frequently shot, when floating near the surface
of the water. Other sorts of fish are
often so destroyed. In June, 1808, Mr.
Byrne, the Earl of Lonsdale’s gamekeeper, shot
in the river Eden, at Beaumont, near Carlisle,
the extraordinary number of eighty-six fish,
at two shots; the smallest fish was seven
inches in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smaller lakes, which are so profusely
scattered over the surface of this county, vary
in the species of fish which they respectively
produce, as much as they do in their own natural
size and character. Some of them afford
trouts, others pike only, and many are stocked
with both. That this union cannot long subsist,
I should be inclined to infer from one remarkable
circumstance, and it is a convincing
proof of the rapid destruction which the introduction
of pike into a trout lake will occasion.
Within a short distance of Castlebar
there is a small bog-lake, called Derreens;
ten years ago it was celebrated for its numerous
and well-sized trouts. Accidentally pike
effected a passage into the lough from the
Minola river, and now the trouts are extinct
or, at least, none of them are caught or seen.
Previous to the intrusion of the pikes, half-a-dozen
trouts would be killed in an evening in
Derreens, whose collective weight often
amounted to twenty pounds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Indeed the appetite of one of my pike was
almost insatiable. One morning I threw to
him, one after the other, five roach, each about
four inches in length. He swallowed four of
them, and kept the fifth in his mouth for
about a quarter of an hour, when it also disappeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fish appear, also, to be capable of entertaining
affection for each other. I once caught a
female pike during the spawning season, and
nothing could drive the male away from the
spot at which the female disappeared, whom he
had followed to the very edge of the water.
A person who had kept two small fish together
in a glass, gave one of them away; the other
refused to eat, and showed evident symptoms
of uneasiness till his companion was restored
to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boldness of a pike is very extraordinary.
I have seen one follow a bait within a foot of
the spot where I have been standing; and the
head keeper of Richmond Park assured me
that he was once washing his hand at the side
of a boat in the great pond in that Park, when
a pike made a dart at it, and he had but just
time to withdraw it.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gentleman (Major Payne) now residing
at Weybridge, in Surrey, informed me, that,
walking one day by the side of the river Wey,
near that town, he saw a large pike in a shallow
creek. He immediately pulled off his
coat, tucked up his shirt-sleeves, and went into
the water to intercept the return of the fish to
the river, and to endeavour to throw it upon
the bank by getting his hands under it. During
this attempt, the pike, finding he could not
make his escape, seized one of the arms of the
gentleman, and lacerated it so much that the
wound is still very visible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The digestion of the pike is so rapid, that,
in a few hours, not a single bone of a roach
which it has swallowed can be discovered.
This may account for the fact of a pike, who
has gorged himself to the full, holding a small
fish in his mouth whilst the digestion of his
previously taken prey has been going on, and
swallowing it as soon as that process had been
effected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rapid growth of some fish is very extraordinary.
I saw three pikes taken out of
a pond in Staffordshire belonging to the present
Sir Jervoise Clark Jervoise, two of which
weighed thirty-six pounds each, and the other
thirty-five pounds. The pond was fished every
seven years, and, supposing that store pike of
six or seven pounds weight were left in it, the
growth of the pike in question must have been
at the rate of at least four pounds a year.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>About seventeen years since, when visiting
the late Marquis of Clanricarde at Portumna
Castle, two gentlemen brought to the marquis
an immense pike, which they had just caught
in the river Shannon, on the banks of which
they had been taking their evening walk.
Attracted by a noise and splashing of the
water, they discovered in a little creek a number
of perch driven on shore, and a fish which,
in pursuit of them, had so entangled himself
with the ground, as to have a great part of its
body exposed, and out of water. They attacked
him with an oar, that by accident lay
on the bank, and killed him. Never having
seen any fish of this species so large, they
judged it worth the observation of the marquis,
who, equally surprised at its magnitude,
had it weighed, and to our astonishment it
exceeded the balance at ninety-two pounds;
its length was such, that when carried across
the oar by the two gentlemen, who were neither
of them short, the head and tail touched
the ground.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Now that I am speaking of pike I may
observe that eagles, which were rather numerous
hereabout, were not unfrequently seen
to pounce on those fish whilst basking near
the surface. It was said, however, that when
the pike was very large, he had been known
to carry the eagle under water; when, from
the latter being unable to disengage his talons,
he was of course drowned. Indeed, Dr. Mellerborg,
a medical gentleman attached to the
Uddeholm establishment when I first visited
Wermeland, vouched for this being the fact,
he himself having once seen an enormous
pike, with an eagle fastened to his back, lying
dead on a piece of ground which had been
overflown, but from which the water had then
retreated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Eurenius also informed me, that
he himself was once an eye-witness to a similar
occurrence. This was on the Götha river,
and at no great distance from Wenersborg.
In this instance, when the eagle first seized
the pike, he was enabled to lift him a short
distance into the air; but the weight of the
fish, together with its struggles, soon carried
them back again to the water, under which
for a while they both disappeared: presently,
however, the eagle again came to the surface,
uttering at the same time the most piercing
cries, and making apparently every endeavour
to extricate his talons, but all was in vain,
and, after a deal of struggling, he was finally
carried under the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Eurenius said, moreover, that pike
were occasionally taken alive with only the
legs and talons of the eagle attached to their
backs, the body of the bird having previously
rotted off. This, if true, is a curious circumstance;
for one would naturally have supposed,
that with such a knapsack the fish
would have been unable to procure his food,
and that he consequently must soon have
perished.</p>

<p class='c006'>In corroboration of these stories I may
mention, that when I was in the Orkney
Islands a few years ago, I was told of the
eagle striking turbot and other fish at sea,
when similar results to what I have just
stated occasionally took place. At that time,
however, I confess, I was a little incredulous
on the subject.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There are no waters in Great Britain, with
the exception of the river Shannon, where
larger pikes are caught than those taken in
Loughs Mask and Corrib. It would appear,
that in these lakes the fish are commensurate
to the waters they inhabit. It is no unusual
event for pikes of thirty pounds weight to be
sent to the landlords by their tenants; and
fish of even fifty pounds have not unfrequently
been caught with nets and night-lines. The
trouts in those loughs are also immensely
large. From five to fifteen pounds is no
unusual size, and some have been found that
reached the enormous weight of thirty. The
perch tribe appear the smallest in the scale of
relative proportion. These seldom exceed a
herring size, but they too have exceptions,
and perch of three or four pounds weight
have been sometimes seen. Within fifty years
this latter fish has increased prodigiously, and
in the lakes and rivers where they abound
trouts have been found to diminish in an equal
ratio. If any doubt remained touching the
fecundity of the perch, some of the Mayo
waters would prove it satisfactorily. Half a
century since, I have been assured that pike
and perch were almost unknown in the rivers
of Belcarra and Minola, and the chain of
lakes with which they communicate, and that
these waters were then second to none for
trout-fishing. Within ten years, my cousin
tells me that he often angled in them, and
that he frequently killed from three to six
dozen of beautiful middle-sized red trouts.
Now, fly-fishing is seldom practised there.
The trout is nearly extinct, and quantities of
pike and perch infest every pool and stream.
The simplest methods of taking fish will be
here found successful, and the lakes of Westmeath
will soon be rivalled by the loughs of
Mayo.—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Lloyd</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pilcher</span> or <span class='sc'>Pilchard</span>, <i>s.</i> A fish like a herring.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pilchard has a general likeness to the
herring, but, when comparatively described, is
essentially different. The body of the pilchard
is less compressed, being thicker and
rounder; the back is more elevated, the belly
less sharp, the nose turns up, and, as well as
the under jaw, is shorter, the dorsal fin is
placed exactly in the centre of gravity, so that
when taken up by it, the body preserves an
equilibrium; that of the herring dips at the
head. The scales of the pilchard adhere closely,
whereas those of the herring very easily drop
off; besides the pilchard is fatter, or more full
of oil.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the middle of July, the pilchards in
vast shoals approach the Cornish coasts; the
beginning of winter they disappear, a few returning
after Christmas. Their winter retreat,
and their motives for migrating, are the
same with the herring. During summer,
they affect a warmer latitude, no quantities
being found on any of our coasts, except those
of Cornwall; namely, from Fowey harbour to
the Scilly Isles, between which places, for
some weeks, the shoals keep shifting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appearance of the pilchard is known
by the birds and larger fishes attendant upon
them, and persons called Huers are placed on
eminences, to point to the boats stationed off
the land the course of the fish, by whose directions
sometimes a bay of several miles’ extent
is enclosed with their nets, called seines.
By the first of James I. c. 23, fishermen are
empowered to go on the grounds of others to
hue, without being liable to action for trespass,
which before occasioned frequent law-suits.
The numbers that are taken at one shooting
of the nets is astonishing. Upon the fifth of
October, 1767, there were at one time inclosed
in St. Ive’s Bay, 7,000 hogsheads, each cask
containing 35,000 fish, in all 245,000,000.</p>

<p class='c006'>This handsome-looking bird is twenty eight
inches in length, and thirty eight in breadth,
and weighs about twenty four ounces. The
bill is rather long, black in the middle, and
blue on the edges; the irides reddish; the
head and throat are of a rusty brown, mottled
with small dark spots, and tinged behind the
ears with purple; the nape and upper part of
the neck are dusky, margined by a narrow
white line, which runs down on each side, and
falling into a broader stripe of the same colour,
extends itself on the fore part as far as the
breast; the rest of the neck, the breast, and
the upper part of the back, are elegantly pencilled
with black and white waved lines; the
lower back and sides of the body are undulated
in the same manner, but with lines
more freckled, less distinct, and paler; the
scapulars are long and pointed, each feather
black down the middle with white edges; the
coverts of the wings are ash-brown, tipped
with dull orange; below these the wing is
obliquely crossed by the beauty spot of glossy
bronze purple green, with a lower border of
black and white; this spangle is formed by
the outer webs and tips of the middle quills;
the rest of the quills are dusky. All the tail
feathers are of a brown ash-colour, with pale
edges, except the two middle ones, which are
black, slightly glossed with green, considerably
longer than the others, and end in a point;
the belly and sides of the vent are white;
under tail-coverts black; legs and feet small,
and of a lead colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is less than the male, and her
plumage is of a much plainer cast, all the
upper parts being brown, with each feather
margined more or less with white, inclining to
red or yellow; the greater coverts and secondary
quills are tipped with cream-colour and
white which form a bar across the wings. The
fore-part of the neck, the breast, and the belly
to the vent, are of a dull white, obscurely
spotted with brown. The tail is long and
pointed, but the two middle feathers do not
extend themselves beyond the rest, like those
of the male.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds do not visit the temperate and
warm climates in great numbers, except in very
severe winters, the great bulk of them dropping
short, and remaining during that season in
various parts of the Russian dominions, Sweden,
Norway, &amp;c., and also in the same latitudes
in both Asia and America. They are
seldom numerous in England, but flocks of
them are sometimes abundantly spread along
the isles and shores of Scotland and Ireland,
and on the interior lakes of those countries, as
well as those of the continent as far south as
Italy, and in America as far south as New York.
They are esteemed excellent eating.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Piquet</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Piquet is played by two persons, with
thirty-two cards: the ace, king, queen, knave,
ten, nine, eight, and seven of each suit. The
ace is the superior, and equal to eleven points;
the king ranks above the queen, and the
queen above the knave, &amp;c. The three court
cards are each equal to ten points; the ten,
ten; the nine, nine; and so of the rest, each
counting for as many points as it has pips.</p>

<p class='c006'>The game consists of 101 points. The
players begin with shuffling the cards; then
they are to cut; he who cuts the lowest
deals, but the great advantage is in being elder
hand. The dealer then shuffles the cards
again, and presents them to his adversary, who
may also shuffle, but the dealer must have
the last shuffle. If the adversary should
scatter the cards, or cut but one off, or leave
but one at the bottom, the dealer may mix
and shuffle them again. The dealer is to give
twelve a piece, by two at a time, and the eight
cards which remain must be placed upon the
table, and are called the talon or stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this game there are three superior
chances, viz. the repique, the pique, and the
capot, all which may be made in one deal, as
thus: suppose one of the players to have four
tierce-majors, his point to be good, and he is
eldest hand: he begins by counting three for
his point, then twelve for his four tierce-majors,
next fourteen for the four aces, fourteen
for the four kings, and fourteen for the
four queens, then sixty for the repique, thirteen
he gains in playing the cards; and he
has forty for the capot, which make together
one hundred and seventy: this stroke, perhaps,
has never happened; but it is just if it
ever should.</p>

<p class='c006'>To pique the adversary, you must be elder
hand; for if youngest, your adversary counts
one for the first card he plays, and then you
having counted only twenty-nine in hand,
even if you take the first trick, it will not
authorise you to count sixty, but only thirty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carte blanche precedes every thing,
then follows the point, then the huitièmes,
the septièmes, the sixièmes, the quints, the
quarts, the tierces, the four aces, kings, queens,
knaves, or tens; then the three aces, kings,
queens, knaves, or tens; then the points
gained in playing the cards; and the last is
the ten for winning the cards, or the forty for
the capot. After sorting the cards, the first
thing to be considered is, whether you have a
carte blanche, if so, let your adversary discard,
and when he is going to take in lay
your twelve cards on the table, counting them
one after another.</p>

<p class='c006'>The players having examined their hands,
the elder hand may discard five cards or fewer
as he may deem for his advantage, and, laying
them aside, he takes as many from the talon
or heap; the youngest hand can lay out three
only, unless any of the five allotted to his
adversary be left, which he may take or not,
as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c006'>In discarding, the first intention in skilful
players is, to gain the cards, and to have the
point, which most commonly engages them to
keep in that suit, of which they have the
most cards, or that which is their strongest;
for it is convenient to prefer, sometimes, forty-one
in one suit to forty-four in another, in
which a quint is not made; sometimes, even
having a quint, it is more advantageous to
hold the forty-one, where, if one card only be
taken in, it may make it a quint-major, and
gain the point, or the cards, which could not
have been done by holding the forty-four, at
least, without an extraordinary take-in. Also
endeavour, in laying out, to get a quatorze;
that is, four aces, kings, queens, knaves, or
tens, each of which counts for fourteen, and
is therefore called a quatorze. The fourteen
aces in your hand hinder the counting fourteen
kings in the adversary’s, &amp;c., and by this
superiority you may count a lesser quatorze,
as of tens, notwithstanding your adversary may
have fourteen kings, &amp;c., because the stronger
(viz. the aces) annuls the weaker: and also,
in the want of a lesser quatorze you may
count three aces, three kings, three queens,
three knaves, or three tens. Three aces are
better than three kings; and he who has
them may by virtue thereof count his three
tens, although the adversary may have three
kings; in favour of a quatorze you count not
only any lesser quatorze, but also all the
threes which you have, except of nines, eights,
and sevens. The same is to be observed in
regard to the huitièmes, septièmes, sixièmes,
quints, quarts, and tierces, to which the player
must have regard in his discarding, so that
what he takes in may make them for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The point being selected, the eldest hand
declares what it is, and asks if it be good: if
his adversary have not so many, he answers it
is good; if he have just as many, he answers
it is equal; and if he have more, he answers
it is not good; for whoever has the point,
whether eldest or youngest, counts it first;
but if the points be equal, neither can count:
it is the same when the players have equal
tierces, quarts, quints, &amp;c., and whoever should
hold several other sequences, either of the
same goodness or lesser cannot count them.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the elder hand has counted the point,
he should examine if he have not tierce, quart,
quint, &amp;c., and then if any quatorze, or three
aces, kings, &amp;c., that he may reckon them,
should his adversary not hinder him by having
better.</p>

<p class='c006'>The points, the tierces, quarts, quints, &amp;c.,
are to be shown on the table, that their value
may be seen and reckoned; but you are not
obliged to show quatorzes, or three aces, kings,
queens, knaves, or tens.</p>

<p class='c006'>After each has examined his game, and the
elder, by the questions asked, seen every thing
that is good in his hand, he begins to reckon.
The carte blanche is first reckoned, then the
point, next the sequences, and lastly, the quatorzes,
as well as threes of aces, kings, &amp;c.,
after which he begins to play his cards, counting
one for each, except it be a nine or an inferior
card.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the elder hand has led his first card,
the younger shows his point, if it be good,
also the sequences, quatorzes, or threes of
aces, kings, &amp;c., and having reckoned them all
together, he takes the first trick if he can with
the same suit, and counts one for it; if he
cannot, the other turns the trick and continues;
and when the younger hand can take
the trick, he may lead what suit he pleases.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good player is principally known from an
indifferent one by his manner; and it is not
possible to play well without knowing the
strength of the game; that is to say, by your
own hand you should know what your adversary
may hold, and what he must have discarded,
and great notice should be taken of
what he has shown or reckoned. There are
no trumps at piquet, but the highest card of
the suit, if played, takes the trick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should the elder hand have the misfortune
to hold neither point, sequence, quatorze, or
threes which are good, he must begin to count
by playing that card which he judges most
proper, and continue until his adversary has
played a superior, to gain the lead in his turn.
This method must be continued till all the
twelve cards are played, and he who takes the
last trick counts two. Then each player
counts how many tricks he has taken, and he
who has the most reckons the cards; but
should they be equal, neither side can count
any thing for the cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as a deal is finished, each player
should mark how many points he has made,
and so proceed until the game be completed;
and after every deal the cards must be shuffled
and cut for the next; each player taking his
turn, unless the game be concluded in one
deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>When you begin another game, the cards
must be cut afresh for the deal, unless it be
agreed upon at first, that the deal shall go on.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were awakened early the next morning
by some of our party, who had come to Versailles
for the express purpose of witnessing the
great shooting match which was to take place
at six o’clock in the gardens of the manufactory.
Accordingly we repaired to the appointed
spot, attended by M. Boute, one of the
principal overseers. I naturally imagined, that
the pistols to be tried on this occasion were
those of the manufactory, but I found this was
not the case, the locks only having been constructed
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first match being read, whereby Mr.
Tripper had engaged that an Italian gentleman
named Dance, would hit a cork of an ordinary
size, at sixteen yards’ distance, four times out
of five, for two hundred guineas, Mr. Dance
begged leave to state, that his friend must have
laboured under an error, as he never pretended
to hit more than once in five shots, and consequently
declined any other. The forfeit
money was therefore paid to me as judge, and
an elegant dinner agreed on for a subsequent
day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second bet was between Mr. Tripper,
and Mr. H—— when the former wagered
twenty guineas that Mr. H—— could not hit
a cork at the same distance once in ten shots.
At the first trial Mr. H—— very nearly
struck the cork, and bets were keenly laid on
his side, but notwithstanding he made good
mark he proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Dance was then matched to hit a card-wafer,
twice in four shots, at sixteen yards for
thirty guineas. His aim proved accurate three
times, and he consequently won the wager.
Mr. Boute came forward and hit the wafer
four times successively, but missed in two
other trials.—<i>Thornton.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This genus is distinguished by a large full
eye; the bill is straight, short, and rather
swollen towards the tip; the head is large; the
legs are naked above the knee; and most of
the species are without the hind toe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the plover has generally been
classed with those birds whose business is
wholly among water, we cannot help considering
the greater part of them as partaking entirely
of the nature of land birds. Many of
them breed upon our loftiest mountains, and
though they are frequently seen upon the sea
coast, feeding with birds of the water kind, yet
it must be observed that they are no more water
birds than any of our small birds which
repair thither for the same purpose. The long
legged plover and the sanderling are waders,
and belong more immediately to the water
birds, to which we refer them; the great plover
and the lapwing we consider as entirely
connected with birds of the plover kind; the
former has usually been classed with the bustard,
and the latter with the sandpiper; but
they differ very materially from both, and seem
to agree in more essential points with this kind.
We have therefore given them a place in this
part of our work, where, with the rest of the
plovers, they may be considered as connecting
the two great divisions of land and water birds,
to both of which they are in some degree allied.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Great Plover</i>, <i>Thick-kneed</i>, <i>Bustard</i>,
<i>Stone Curlew</i>, <i>Norfolk Plover</i>. (<i>Charadrius
œdicnemus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Grand Pluvier</i>,
<span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The length of this bird is about
sixteen inches. Its bill is long, yellowish at
the base, and black at the tip; its irides and
eyelids are pale yellow; above each eye there
is a pale streak, and beneath one of the same
colour extends to the bill, the throat is white,
the head, neck, and all the upper parts of the
body are of a pale tawny brown; down the
middle of each feather there is a dark streak;
the forepart of the neck and the breast are
nearly of the same colour, but much paler;
the belly, thighs, and vent, are of a pale yellowish
white, the quills are black; the tail is
short and rounded, and a dark band crosses the
middle of each feather; the tips are black, the
rest white: the legs are yellow, and naked
above the knees, which are very thick as if
swollen, hence its name, the claws are black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is found in great plenty in Norfolk
and several of the southern counties, but
is nowhere to be met with in the northern
parts of our island; it prefers dry and stony
places on the sides of sloping banks. It makes
no nest: the female lays two or three eggs on
the bare ground, sheltered by a stone or in a
small hole formed in the sand; they are of a
dirty white, marked with spots of a deep reddish
colour, mixed with slight streaks. Although
this bird has great power of wing, and
flies with great strength, it is seldom seen during
the day, except it is surprised, when it
springs to some distance, and generally escapes
before the sportsman comes within gun-shot;
it likewise runs on the ground almost as swiftly
as a dog; after running some time it stops short,
holding its head and body still, and on the least
noise it squats close on the ground. In the
evening it comes out in quest of food and may
then be heard at a great distance: its cry is
singular, resembling a hoarse kind of whistle,
three or four times repeated, and has been compared
to the turning of a rusty handle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Buffon endeavours to express it by the words
<i>turlui, turlui</i>, and says it resembles the sound
of a third flute, dwelling on three or four tones
from a flat to a sharp. Its food consists chiefly
of worms. It is said to be good eating when
young, the flesh of the old ones is hard, black,
and dry. Mr. White mentions them as frequenting
the district of Selborne, in Hampshire.
He says, that the young run immediately
from the nest almost as soon as they are
excluded, like partridges; that the dam leads
them to some stony field where they bask,
skulking among the stones, which they resemble
so nearly in colour as not easily to be discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Birds of this kind are migratory; they arrive
in April, live with us all the spring and
summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare
to take leave, by getting together in flocks:
it is supposed that they retire to Spain, and
frequent the sheep-walks with which that
country abounds.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Golden Plover</i>, <i>Yellow Plover</i>.
(<i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Pluvier
doré</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The size of the turtle; bill
dusky; eyes dark; all the upper parts of the
plumage are marked with bright yellow spots
upon a dark brown ground; the fore part of
the neck and breast are the same, but much
paler; the belly is almost white; the quills
are dusky; the tail is marked with dusky and
yellow bars; the legs are black. Birds of
this species vary very much from each other;
in some which we have had the breast was
marked with black and white; in others it
was almost black; but whether this difference
arose from age or sex we are at a loss to
determine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The golden plover is common in this country
and all the northern parts of Europe; it
is very numerous in various parts of America,
from Hudson’s Bay as far as Carolina, migrating
from one place to another, according to
the seasons. It breeds on high and heathy
mountains; the female lays four eggs, of a
pale olive colour, variegated with blackish
spots. They fly in small flocks, and make
a shrill whistling noise, by an imitation of
which they are sometimes enticed within gun
shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>The male and female do not differ from
each other. In young birds the yellow spots
are not very distinguishable, as the plumage
inclines more to grey.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Grey Plover.</i> (<i>Tringa squaturola</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Vanneau Pluvier</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The
length of this bird is about twelve inches; its
bill is black; the head, back, and wing coverts,
are of a dusky brown, edged with greenish
ash-colour, and some with white; the
cheeks and throat are white, marked with
oblong dusky spots; the belly, sides, and rump,
are white: the sides are marked with a few
dusky spots; the outer webs of the quills
are black; the lower parts of the inner webs
of the first four are white; the tail is marked
with alternate bars of black and white; the
legs are of a dull green; the hind toe is
small. In the Planches Enluminées this bird
is represented with eyes of an orange colour;
there is likewise a dusky line extending from
the bill underneath each eye, and a white one
above it.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have placed this bird with the plovers,
as agreeing with them in every other respect
but that of having a very small hind toe; but
this is so slight a difference as not to render
it necessary to exclude it from a place in the
plover family, to which it evidently belongs.
The grey plover is not very common in Britain;
it appears sometimes in small flocks on
the sea coasts. It is somewhat larger than
the golden plover. Its flesh is said to be very
delicate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Long-legged Plover</i>, <i>Long-shanks</i>, or
<i>Long-leg</i>. (<i>Charadrius himantopus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>
<i>L’Echasse</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Its slender black bill is
two inches and a half long, from the tip of
which to the end of the tail it measures only
about thirteen inches, but to the toes a foot
and a half; the wings are long, measuring
from tip to tip twenty-nine inches; irides red;
the crown of the head, back, and wings, a
glossy black; tail light grey, except the two
outside feathers, which are white, as are all
the other parts of its plumage, except a few
dusky spots on the back of the neck. Its
long, weak, and disproportionate legs are of a
blood red, and measure from the foot to the
upper naked part of the thigh about eight
inches; the toes are short, and the outer and
middle ones are connected by a membrane at
the base.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ornithologists mention only a few instances
of this singular looking species having been
met with in Great Britain, but it is common
in other countries.</p>

<p class='c006'>Latham says it is common in Egypt, being
found there in the marshes in October; its
food is said to consist principally of flies. It
is likewise plentiful about the salt lakes, and
is often seen on the shores of the Caspian Sea,
as well as by the rivers which empty themselves
into it, and in the southern deserts of
Independent Tartary. We have also seen it
on Chinese paintings, and it is known at Madras
in the East Indies. It is also often met
with in the warmer parts of America; is
sometimes seen as far north as Connecticut,
and also in Jamaica.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Plover Shooting.</i>—There is, in shooting
plovers, a common remark made by sportsmen
that the second is always the more productive
barrel. The rapidity with which they vary
their position when on the ground, seldom
admits of a grand combination for a sitting, or
rather a running-shot. But when on the
wing, their mode of flight is most favourable
for permitting the shot to tell; and it is by no
means unusual to bring down a number.
When disturbed, they frequently wheel back
directly above the fowler, and offer a tempting
mark if he should have a barrel in reserve;
and even when too high for the shot to take
effect, I have often thrown away a random
fire; for the plovers, on hearing the report,
directly make a sweep downwards on the
wing, and I have by this means brought them
within range of the second barrel.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Golden plovers were formerly killed in great
plenty by means of a stalking-horse. If you
fire at these birds as they fly over you, they
will dart down for the moment, and spread in
every direction; so that by taking a random
shot with your first barrel, you may often
bring down the birds to a fair one for your
second.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>I believe that no attention has been paid
to the effects of different kinds of food on the
colours of birds. The linnet and redpole, in
confinement, lose, after the first moult, their
red colour, and it does not return. Is this
owing to the want of the peculiar food they
would take in the spring, if at liberty, or to
their being less exposed to the sunshine? I
once saw the English white water-lily blow
of a pale rose colour, after a week of unusual
heat in July. Birds that change their colours
at different seasons, always put on their bright
garb in the warm season. I have repeatedly
observed, in a splendid nondescript finch
which I possess, that, although it moults
partially twice in the year, the colour of the
larger feathers on the wings and back changes
gradually from yellowish brown to scarlet, and
fades again at the approach of winter. In
this bird, the change to grey red is very clearly
occasioned by the increase of temperature. I
have observed, in the spring, that the supervention
of cold weather stops its progress. In
the Whidah bird, the mutation of dress is
rapid, accompanying the moult in June and
July. The American blue bird pushes brown
feathers in its summer moult, which are very
suddenly turned to blue. There is a mystery
in these mutations which we do not understand.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is not easy to account for the variation
we sometimes perceive in the plumage of
birds of the same species. I have observed a
rook with one white wing, during the last
three years, in the rookery in Hampton Court
park; and I saw a sparrow nearly white,
amongst a flock of those birds, at West Molesey.
A linnet was shot and brought to me
from the same place, which was beautifully
mottled with white and brown. Some years
ago I was shown some white blackbirds, in
the grounds of a nobleman at Blackheath,
which had been bred there; and what showed
this was not an accidental circumstance,
they produced young of the same colour as
themselves.—<i>White of Selborne</i>—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The pochard is nineteen inches in length,
and two feet and a half in breadth, and weighs
about one pound thirteen ounces. The bill is
of a dark lead-colour, with the tip and sides
near the nostrils, black: irides fine deep yellow:
the head and neck are of a glossy chestnut,
joined to a large space of sooty black,
which covers the breast, and is spread over
the shoulders: the lower part of the back,
rump, tail-coverts, and vent, are also black:
the rest of the plumage, both above and below,
is wholly covered with prettily freckled,
slender, dusky threads, disposed transversely
in close-set zig-zag lines, on a pale ground,
more or less shaded off with ash, and deepest
on the wing-coverts. The primary quills are
brown, with dusky tips; the secondaries lead-colour,
tinged with brown, and slightly tipped
with dull white. The tail consists of twelve
short feathers, of a dark-brownish ash, which
have also a hoary grey appearance: the legs
and toes are lead-colour, shaded and dashed
with black. This species is without the beauty-spot
on the wings, and has altogether a more
plain and half-mourning kind of look than
others of this tribe. The specimen from which
the above figure was drawn, was shot at Axwell-park,
in the county of Durham: the description
was taken from one shot in January,
near Holy Island. The former differed from
the latter in wanting the black on the rump
and vent, and in some other slight variations
in the shadings of its colours.</p>

<p class='c006'>The head of the female is of a pale reddish-brown;
the breast is of rather a deeper colour;
the coverts of the wings plain ash-colour;
the back marked like that of the
male; the belly ash-coloured.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds leave the north on the approach
of winter, and migrate southward as
far, it is said, as Egypt, in Africa, and Carolina
and Louisiana, in America. They arrive
in the marshes of France about the end of
October, in tolerably numerous flocks; and
considerable numbers of them are caught in
the fens of Lincolnshire during the winter
season, and sold in the London markets,
where they and the female wigeons are indiscriminately
called dunbirds, and esteemed excellent
eating. It has not yet been discovered
whether any of them remain to breed in England.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pochard is of a plump, round shape,
and its walk is heavy, ungraceful, and waddling;
but when on the wing they fly with
greater rapidity than the mallard, and in flocks
of from twenty to forty, commonly in a close
compact body, whereby they may be easily
distinguished from the triangular-shaped flocks
of the wild duck, as well as by the difference
of the noise of their wings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The few attempts which have been made
to domesticate this species have failed of
success. They do pretty well where they
have plenty of water, but it is said that they
cannot bear walking about on hard, pebbly
ground.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><i>The Spanish Pointer.</i> (<i>Canis Avicularis,
variety α</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—This dog, as his
name implies, is a native of the Peninsula,
and was introduced into this country at a very
early period. Great attention was paid by
sportsmen for a long series of years to preserve,
in purity, this important breed; but
lately it has in a great measure been set aside
in field sports, a more improved race having
been produced by crossing, usually called the
English pointer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Spanish pointer is much larger and
stronger than the English, and is also more
steady. He seems to have an inherent aptness
for receiving instruction. Indeed it requires
but little tuition to render him fit for
the field; as, in most instances, young dogs of
this breed will point of their own accord,
whilst the more improved kinds require considerable
drilling to initiate them, and make
them do their work steadily.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Spanish breed is the most staunch of
all dogs, and if they had speed and activity in
proportion to their steadiness, they would excel
all others which are auxiliary to man in
the sports of the field. From their weight,
however, they are not so well suited for an
extensive range, nor are they so hardy as the
English dog, on which account they are ill
adapted for the laborious amusement of grouse-shooting.
They are now chiefly used by those
who confine their sport to the pheasant and
partridge.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The English Pointer</i> (<i>Canis Avicularis,
variety β.</i>)—This dog is sprung
from the Spanish pointer, but is of a much
lighter form, and much more rapid in his
movements. He was obtained originally by
a cross of the latter and the fox-hound, and
has since been recrossed with the harrier. The
English pointer is of a great variety of sizes,
being in this particular bred according to the
taste of the sportsman.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog possesses a beautiful symmetry of
frame, and in this respect is, perhaps, the
most elegant of all the canine tribe. His
docility and pliability of temper, too, are truly
astonishing, and he enjoys, at the same time,
the sense of smelling in an exquisite degree.</p>

<p class='c006'>About sixty years ago, the breed of pointers
was nearly white, or mostly variegated with
liver-coloured spots, except the celebrated dogs
of the then Duke of Kingston, whose black
pointers were considered superior to all others
in the kingdom, and sold for immense sums
after his death. Since that time they have
been bred of all sizes and colours, and have
at length attained that degree of perfection
for which they are now so justly prized all
over Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dogs of the middle size are now generally
considered the best by experienced
sportsmen; the larger kinds, like the Spanish
pointer, are too heavy, and soon tire in warm
weather, although they are best adapted for
hunting in the high turnips, heath, and broomfields.</p>

<p class='c006'>In proportion as the breed of pointers diverges
in blood from their Spanish original,
the difficulty of training them, and rendering
them staunch for the field, increases, as they
seem to lose a quality inherent in the latter
dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pointers are never considered complete in
training, unless they are perfectly staunch to
bird, dog, and gun, which implies, first, standing
singly to a bird or covey; secondly, to
backing or pointing the moment he perceives
another dog to stand at game; and, thirdly,
not to stir from his own point at the rising of
any bird, or the firing of any gun in the field,
provided the game is neither sprung nor
started at which he himself originally pointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pointer possesses a degree of mildness
and pliability of disposition most admirably
adapted for receiving instruction, and his mental
faculties are extremely acute. He is
most susceptible of impressions; serene in his
general habits, and unwearied in his attachments.
With all these good points, he is
well qualified to secure the esteem and confidence
of man, whom he is always solicitous
to please, and obedient to all that is inculcated
upon him. Whenever he is conscious of his
own powers and education, he makes it his
whole business to serve and amuse his master.
At the same time, he will also perform his
work to others to whom he may be lent, and
is sensible of the duty required of him the
moment he enters the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pointers are seldom used in any other kind
of shooting than that of grouse, partridge, and
snipe; in the two last of which sports their
merits are the more conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel informs us, that he once had a
pointer that would always go round close to
the hedges of a field before he would quarter
his ground; the dog being sensible that he
most frequently found his game in the course
of this circuit, and therefore very naturally
took the middle road to discover it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Small Pointer</i> (<i>Canis Avicularis,
minor variety, γ.</i>)—I have just seen an extremely
small pointer, in the possession of
C. G. Stewart Menteath, Esq. of Closeburn.
His length, from the tip of the nose to the
point of the tail, is only two feet and half an
inch; from the one fore-foot to the other,
across the shoulders, two feet; length of the
head, six inches; round the chest, one foot
three inches. He is an exquisite miniature
of the English pointer, being in all respects
similar to him. His colour is white, with
dark liver-coloured patches on each side of the
head, extending half down the neck; the ears,
with some patches on the back, are also of the
same colour; and numerous small dark brown
spots appear over his whole body and legs.
This beautiful little animal has an exquisite
sense of smell; and it is said that some of the
same variety, possessed by the Earl of Lauderdale,
have been broken in, and make excellent
pointers; although, from their minute
size, it cannot be expected that they will be
able to do much work. When intent on any
object, the dog assumes the same attitude as
other pointers, holding up one of his feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have not been able to ascertain the native
county of this variety, although I have been
informed it is common in the south of Germany.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir James Colquhoun has a dog of the same
breed, which is even smaller than that belonging
to Mr. Menteath.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Russian Pointer</i> (<i>Canis Avicularis,
variety δ.</i>)—This variety seems only to
be a descendant of the Spanish pointer, which
he strongly resembles in shape, with rough
wiry hair all over his body, probably arising
from the coldness of the climate, as nature
seems to provide all the dogs of boreal regions
with a covering fitted to resist the inclemency
of the sky. Even his legs are invested with
hair, which is generally of a uniform black
colour, or of a dark umber brown. There is
one peculiarity about him, which is, that his
nose is so deeply cleft that it appears to be
split in two; on which account he is termed,
in Russia, the double-nosed pointer. His
scent is said to be superior to that of the
smooth dogs. His cleft nose is found to be
inconvenient when he is beating in cover, as
the face is apt to be torn where the brushwood
is thick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Russian sportsmen generally feed their
pointers on oatmeal boiled, and they are kept
about their houses.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Colour of Pointers.</i>—Respecting the colour
of pointers (as before observed), a great
deal depends entirely on fancy, but that most
esteemed is the liver and white, although
there are as good dogs of every other colour,
indeed there is hardly a colour but some reason
may be assigned for its being either good
or bad. A white dog is to be preferred on
two accounts; the first is, being all white, he
is void of any thing phlegmatic in his constitution,
which does not hinder him from
retaining the lesson he has been taught, and
prevent his being obedient; besides, he has
always a good nose: secondly, in grouse
shooting, he can be discerned at any distance,
whereas a brown one cannot. A white pointer,
if good, is a treasure to a keen sportsman.
Pointers of lemon, or setters of a red or chestnut
colour, are always the most difficult to be
brought to obedience, by reason of the bilious
humour which prevails in them, and which
causes this irregularity. The white pointer
is full of stratagems and cunning, and is not
so easily tired as dogs of the lemon colour,
which are very giddy and impatient, as choler
is the most predominant humour in them it
in some measure accounts for their being so;
they are very uneasy under correction, and
are certainly more subject to diseases than
any other dogs. Pointers of a brown colour
are generally good ones; but one great objection
to this colour is, they are difficult to be
seen on a mountain, and are sometimes lost,
which gives the sportsman a vast deal of trouble
before he can discover them; but let any
sportsman be asked, if he has not remarked
that a brown-coloured dog will bring him
closer to game than any other, by reason that
they are not so easily perceived by the birds
or game, as one of a white or any other colour.
The compiler, from many years’ experience,
is confident a sportsman will get more shots
with a brown dog than one of any other
colour, and has found him very useful when
birds become shy, and the season is far advanced.—<i>Thornhill.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Poison</span>, <i>s.</i> That which destroys or injures life by a small quantity, and by
means not obvious to the senses, venom.</p>

<p class='c006'>Corrosive sublimate, or oxymuriate of
quicksilver, is a most deadly and unmanageable
poison to dogs, in doses as small even as
five or six grains. Its effects are observed
soon after it is taken, by the distress of the
animal, by his frequent retchings, insatiable
thirst, panting, and anxiety for a cool situation.
The mouth becomes swollen; if the
dose has been large, it appears ulcerated also,
and emits a very fœtid odour, which circumstance
forms a very strong characteristic, both
with regard to the animal’s having been poisoned,
and also to the article employed for
the purpose. As the symptoms advance the
retchings are tinged with blood; the stools
become liquid and bloody also; the heart
beats faintly, but with rapidity; the extremities
become cold; violent tremblings, paralysis,
or convulsions follow, and death relieves
the sufferer. On examination of the body afterwards,
the whole alimentary canal, beginning
at the mouth and proceeding backwards, exhibits
marks of the corrosive nature of the matter
taken. The stomach, on being opened, will appear
covered with highly inflamed patches, and
the villous folds of its inner and rugose surface
will present gangrenous and ulcerated
spots, and a ready separation of the mucous
from the muscular coat, with blood often suffused
between them; which circumstances
only take place when a most acrid poison has
been swallowed. The intestines also show
appearances of great inflammation, particularly
of their inner surface, which will be
found sprinkled with gangrenous specks, and,
moreover, frequently filled with a thick bloody
mucus. Such are the usual morbid appearances;
but satisfactorily to detect the presence
of a poison, and the immediate nature
of it, some of the liquid contents of the
stomach and bowels, both before and after
death, should be saved, and undergo a rigid
chemical analysis. In general cases the addition
of potash to some of these liquid contents
will occasion a light yellow precipitate
when corrosive sublimate has been the poisonous
agent; but a practical chemist will employ
many other tests.</p>

<p class='c006'>The medical treatment to be pursued in
these cases consists in both endeavouring to
envelope and to neutralise the acrid matter:
the former may be attempted by means of a
glairy fluid, for which purpose the whites of
eggs have proved the most effectual remedies,
beaten into a liquid, given in large quantities,
and repeated as often as they have been
ejected; when these are not immediately at
hand, milk may be substituted. Mild clysters
should also be thrown up. When the stomach
is somewhat appeased, give an opiate and
castor oil. Large doses of soap, dissolved in
water, have been recommended as a counter
poison to corrosive minerals, or their preparations,
and, in the absence of eggs, should be
tried.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arsenic.</i>—This powerful oxide is often
given to dogs, and not unfrequently they find
it for themselves in a state of mixture with
other matters placed to poison rats. The
effects produced by it resemble those occasioned
by corrosive sublimate, except that,
although they prove equally fatal, they are
not apparently so intense. The mouth, likewise,
is not usually affected, in an equal degree,
by this poison as by the other. Dissection,
also, detects similar morbid appearances
to those above detailed; but, unless a very
large dose has been taken, there is not such
complete lesion of the coats of the stomach
and intestines, but the gangrenous spots and
the excess of inflammation are fully sufficient
to detect the disorganising action of a mineral
poison. Instead of subjecting the liquid contents
of the stomach and bowels to the action
of potash, as directed when corrosive sublimate
is looked for, it is usual to detect arsenic
by applying the blue ammoniacal sulphate
of copper, which will produce a lively green
if arsenic is present. A red hot iron will
also occasion these contents to give out a garlic-like
smell under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment proper, in cases of arsenical
poisoning, is to give sugar dissolved in milk,
in considerable quantities, until it may be
supposed that all the poison is evacuated from
the stomach, when a similar treatment is to
be pursued to that before recommended.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In speaking of poisons White makes the
following curious remark.—I once gave two
drachms of stavesacre to a glandered horse; he
died in great pain the following night. It is
probable that more horses have been killed by
aloes, than by any other vegetable preparation.
That is to say, by strong physic, or by neglecting
the horse during its operation. The
best antidote in this case, is gruel made of
arrow-root or fine wheat flour. The animal
poisons are the stings of venomous reptiles,
for which stimulating embrocations seem to
be better remedies than fomentations. The
matter which flows from the nose of a glandered
horse is a strong poison, whether applied
to a recent scratch in the skin, or swallowed
with food or water. The saliva of a mad dog
is a dreadful poison to man, and to all animals.—<i>Blaine</i>—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Poison</span>, <i>v.</i> To infect with poison; to injure, or kill by poison given; to

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Polecat</span>, <i>s.</i> The fitchew; it is of the weasel tribe, and emits a most fetid
smell.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal is known by various names or
local appellations. In some parts of the
country it is called a fitchet, in others a foumart,
in others again a fillemark. The polecat
is larger than the ferret, which, however,
it very much resembles in appearance and
disposition. But, according to the accounts
which have been given us by naturalists,
there are, it seems, internal differences which
distinctly mark these two animals: the polecat
has but fourteen ribs; whereas the ferret
has fifteen; and it also wants one of the
breast bones which is found in the ferret.
The ferret is more slender and elongated
than the polecat, and has also a more pointed
or sharper snout. It is, for the most part, of
a deep chocolate colour; it is white about the
mouth; the ears are short, rounded, and
tipped with white; a little beyond the corners
of the mouth a stripe commences, which
runs backward, partly white and partly yellow.
Its hair is of two sorts, the long and
the furry, and the two kinds are of different
colours: the longer is black, and the shorter
a dull or dirty yellow, which produces the
general chocolate colour already mentioned;
the feet and tail are blacker than any other
parts: the claws are white underneath and
brown above; and its tail is about two inches
and a half long.</p>

<p class='c006'>The polecat, like the fox, avoids as much
as possible the human countenance; and, like
the fox too, possesses the most undaunted
courage. However, in comparing these two
animals, though they happen to agree in the
two particulars just mentioned, yet they are
enemies to each other: or, in other words,
the fox will not fail to kill the polecat whenever
they meet; in fact, the fox may be
regarded as the unrelenting enemy of all the
smaller vermin. Reynard will kill and eat
the wild cat, or any other cat which might
happen to come in his way; as well as the
polecat, the weasel, the stoat, the rat, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>The polecat evinces an insatiate thirst for
blood, and is very destructive to all kinds of
young game; and if it is not openly so to that
which is full grown, it is because it is not so
easily caught: it will surprise hares on their
seats, will seize partridges or pheasants on the
nest; and is incredibly destructive in a rabbit
warren: it will, like all the other animals
of the weasel tribe, kill much more than
it can devour; in fact, so fond are these animals
of sucking the blood of their victims,
that, in a place like a rabbit warren, or wherever
their food is presented in such abundance,
the polecat (and the same of the weasel
and stoat) would continue destroying, if
undisturbed, merely for the sake of the
blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>The polecat is particularly destructive
among pigeons, when it happens to get into a
dove-house:—it despatches each bird with a
single wound near to, or in, the head; and,
after killing all it can, and sucking their
blood, will convey them to its retreat. This
the animal will carefully perform, going and
returning, and bringing them one by one to its
hole; but if it should happen that the opening
by which it got into the dove-house be not
large enough for the body of the pigeon to
pass through, this mischievous animal contents
itself with carrying away the heads, and
makes a most delicious feast upon the brains.</p>

<p class='c006'>The polecat is also fond of honey, frequently
robbing the bee hives in winter, a
period when its prey is not so easily found in
the woods and fields.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their retreat is generally in banks well
sheltered with brambles or underwood, or
amongst brakes or woods, or other similar
situations. They burrow in the ground, making
a tolerably large hole, about two feet
deep, which may easily be known by any one
who has once noticed the hole of a polecat.
In winter, they will frequently approach
houses or buildings, and will rob the hen-roost,
the pigeon-house, or even the dairy,
when pressed by hunger: on these occasions,
they contrive to form a retreat in or under
some of the walls; and if they are unable to
secure an asylum of this sort, they will make
their way under the corn stacks, and whenever
this happens to be the case, all the rats
in the immediate vicinity remove to a greater
distance; the polecat is a deadly enemy to
the rat, and of this the latter is very well
aware; and yet it would appear that the polecat
(from its size) is unable to follow it
through its burrows or runs; and the rat, as
if conscious of this incapacity in the former,
removes no further from the presence of its
enemy than what may suit its convenience.
The writer witnessed an instance, where a
great number of rats were found in a stack
of wheat, but all of them in the upper part;
for several feet from the ground not a rat was
to be met with, which excited some surprise;
but the circumstance developed itself on reaching
the bottom, where it was found an enormous
polecat had taken up its abode.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female brings forth her young in the
spring, to the number of from four to six.
To “stink like a polecat” is a common observation
in some parts; and indeed so impregnated
does every part of the animal appear to
be with a very offensive fetid matter, that
even the fur, which is soft and warm, can
scarcely be divested of it. Whenever the
polecat happens to be killed, the fetid matter
just mentioned issues from the pores of its
body in great quantities, forming a very unpleasant
effluvium, which is perceptible even
at some distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are farmers to be met with who,
whenever a polecat approaches their barns,
buildings, or houses, afford it every possible
protection, on account of its enmity to rats;
but as its chief propensities are in direct opposition
to the views of the sportsman, so gamekeepers
should be careful to destroy it wherever
it is to be met with.</p>

<p class='c006'>If taken young, the polecat is not difficult
to tame; nor in a domestic state is it offensive
to the human olfactory organs; as although
it is impregnated with a fetid matter, yet it
would seem that the effluvium which thence
arises is only thrown off when the animal is
killed or very much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The polecat is seldom seen during the day,
unless compelled by hunger to quit its retreat;
but, as soon as night sets in, it leaves its hole
in quest of prey, when it may be pursued and
killed by terriers. In the midland counties
hunting the polecat by moonlight forms a
diversion for schoolboys and the younger
branches. After night-fall, when the polecat
rambles abroad, its hole (if known) is stopped,
the terriers are thrown off, one of which,
upon whom the greatest dependence can be
placed, has a small bell fastened round his
neck, in order that the hunters may know
where the dogs are questing. When they hit
upon the scent, the terriers give tongue; and
as soon as the polecat finds himself pursued,
he makes directly for his hole, which, if
stopped, he cannot of course enter, and is
compelled to seek some other retreat, during
which he is perhaps killed; if run to ground,
he is very unceremoniously dug out and worried
on the spot, it being a general opinion
amongst the vulgar (in Leicestershire for instance),
that whenever or wherever a polecat
is run to ground, they have a right to dig him
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The above method, however, is not the
mode in which I would recommend gamekeepers
to destroy the polecat; for the accomplishment
of their purpose, they can go
a much shorter and surer way to work: this
animal seems possessed of little cunning, and
is trapped with little difficulty. The steel
trap is generally used for this animal; but it
may be taken in the following manner:—box
traps may be set in the bottom of ditches, or
under walls or pales, with the ends of the
traps fenced up to, for four or five yards aslant,
and two or three yards wide at the entrance,
with earth, bushes, or broken pales, so that
the animal cannot pass without entering the
trap. A trail of red herrings, half broiled,
should be drawn from one trap to another,
and the traps should be baited with the same
material, with which also the ends of the
traps may be rubbed. By having both ends
of box-traps painted white, and rubbed with
herrings or the entrails of any animal, hares
will be deterred from entering. This mode is
well calculated to catch the wild cat, or indeed
any kind of quadrupedal vermin. Therefore,
when any of the traps are sprung, a bag
sufficiently large to admit an end of the trap
is to be provided and slipped over it; and by
rattling at the other end of the trap, the
creature will spring into the bag; for, without
some such precaution, should a wild cat be
caught, the moment the light is admitted it will
fly in the face of the person opening it This
is the method generally adopted by warreners.</p>

<p class='c006'>The steel-trap, however, is by far the best
and surest method of taking the polecat—and
indeed the best method of catching all kinds
of vermin. It is more portable, more easily
prepared, and very rarely fails in its operation.—<i>Gamekeeper’s

<p class='c006'>Very little is known of the habits and
economy of fish, from the nature of the element
in which they live. When I resided
in Bushy Park, I caused the sides and bottom
of a place to be bricked, through which a
stream of very clear water ran, and stocked it
with most of the varieties of our English
fresh-water fish, supplying them abundantly
with food; but though I constantly watched
them, and could see all they did at any time
of the day, the result of my observations was
far from being satisfactory. The perch were
the boldest and most familiar of any of the
fish, as I found no difficulty in soon getting
them to come with eagerness to take a worm
out of my hand. The barbel were the shyest,
and seemed most impatient of observation,
although in the spring, when they could
not perceive any one watching them, they
would roll about and rub themselves against
the brickwork, and show considerable playfulness.
There were some large stones in
my <i>piscatorium</i>, round which they would
wind their spawn in considerable quantities.
The trout appeared to bear their confinement
with less philosophy than any of the others,
making high leaps against the grating which
admitted the water, and seeming at all times
out of sorts and out of condition. The chub
were also very restless, being continually on
the move, but they never could resist a cockchafer
when thrown to them. My flounders
only moved at night, and the eels always
made their escape, but in what way I never
could conjecture, except, indeed, they had the
power of crawling up the brick-work, which
was about five feet from top to bottom, and
generally two feet above the edge of the water.
They certainly could not get through the
grating, which was sufficiently close to confine
bleak and gudgeons; and some of the eels
were of a large size. The pike, of which I
had eight of about five pounds’ weight each,
kept up their character for voracity. Out of
800 gudgeons which were brought to me by
a Thames fisherman, and which I saw counted
into the reservoir—some few of which, however,
died—there were scarcely any to be
seen at the end of three weeks; though I
should mention, that three large barbel I had,
and six good-sized perch, probably partook
of them.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Jesse, p. 86, says, I will now give an
account published by Mr. Neill, in the Scots’
Magazine, of some sea-fish kept in a small
pond into which sea-water could be introduced.
This pond was from time to time replenished
with fish. The following fishes were in it:—</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Cod.</i>—They were lively, and caught
greedily at shell-fish which were thrown into
the pond. They kept chiefly, however, in
the deep water, and, after approaching with a
circular sweep, and making a snatch at the
prey, descended out of sight to devour it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Haddock.</i>—These, contrary to expectation,
were found to be the tamest fishes in
the pond. At ebb tide they came to the
inner margin, and ate limpets from the hand
of a little boy, the son of a keeper. They
appeared white, and rather sickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Coalfish.</i>—Some of these were of a
large size, exceeding in dimensions the largest
cod in the pond. They were bold and familiar,
floating about slowly and majestically,
till some food was thrown to them; this they
seized voraciously, whether it consisted of
shell-fish or ship biscuit. They would also
occasionally approach the margin, and take
their food from the keeper’s hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>Whiting.</i>—These were scarce in the
pond, and very shy.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <i>Pollack.</i>—This was pretty common,
and has been found to answer well as a pond
fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <i>Salmon.</i>—This was the wildest and
quickest in its motions of all the inhabitants.
When a muscle or limpet, freed from the
shell, was thrown on the surface of the water,
the salmon very often darted forward and
took the prey from all the competitors, disappearing
with a sudden jerk and turn of the
body.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. <i>Flat fish</i> or <i>flounders</i>, of two sorts, were
also in the pond, but they naturally kept at
the bottom, and were not seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The food given to the fishes consisted
chiefly of sand-eels and of shell-fish, particularly
limpets and muscles. In the herring-fishery
season, herrings were cut in pieces
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is remarkable that all the kinds of sea-fish
above enumerated, seemed to agree very
well together. No fighting had ever been
observed by the keeper, and seldom any
chasing of one species by another. None of
the fish ever bred.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Fleming has remarked, that when a
salt-water fish is put into fresh water, its
motions speedily become irregular, its respiration
appears to be affected, and, unless released,
it soon dies; and that the same consequences
follow when a fresh-water fish is suddenly
immersed in salt water.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is not, however, the case with all fish.
A cod will not only live, but thrive well in
fresh water, if properly fed. A respectable
fishmonger assured me that he had tried the
experiment, and succeeded, and offered to
send me some live cod in a well-boat, for my
<i>piscatorium</i> in Bushy Park.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Immense value of pond fish.</i>—The fish
in the ponds of Lucullus, sold, after his decease,
for 3,000,000 of sesterces (24,218<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>
sterling). Caius Hirtus first introduced the
keeping of lampreys in stews, and lent Cæsar,
during the time of his triumph, 600 of these
fish, for which he would receive no equivalent
in money, nor any other commodity, but conditioned
the repayment to be the same number
and weight of lampreys. His ponds and
fish about his house, which was itself extremely
small, were sold for one million more
than the above sum (32,291<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>)</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In August 1799, the Earl of Essex fished a
large pond near Radnor Forest, which had been
stocked fifty-eight years. Carp and eels were
the only fish found in it; of the former, 100
brace were taken that weighed from fourteen
to fifteen pounds each carp; of the latter,
the largest exceeded eight pounds.—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>A friend of mine had a poodle-dog possessed
of more than ordinary sagacity; but he was,
however, under little command. In order to
keep him in better order, my friend purchased
a small whip, with which he corrected the
dog once or twice during a walk. On his return
the whip was put on a table in the hall,
and the next morning it was missing. It was
soon afterwards found concealed in an out-building,
and again made use of in correcting
the dog. It was, however, again lost, but
found hidden in another place. On watching
the dog, who was suspected of being the culprit,
he was seen to take the whip from the
hall-table, and run away with it, in order again
to hide it. The late James Cumming, Esq.
was the owner of the dog, and related this
anecdote to me.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pooka</span>, <i>s.</i> A mode of fishing sometimes used in the Irish lakes.</p>

<p class='c006'>By mesh-nets immense numbers of pike are
annually taken; and with night-lines, and a
very simple contrivance, called the pooka,
these fish, with the largest trout and perch,
are constantly killed.</p>

<p class='c006'>This latter implement is formed of a piece
of flat board, having a little mast and sail
erected on it. Its use is to carry out the extremity
of a long line, of considerable stoutness,
to which, at regulated distances, an infinity
of droppers or links are suspended, each
armed with a hook and a bait. Corks are affixed
to the principal line or back, to keep it
buoyant on the surface; and from a weather-shore,
if there be a tolerable breeze, any quantity
of hooks and baits can be floated easily
across the water. The corks indicate to the
fisherman when a fish is on the dropper, and
in a small punt, or curragh, he attends to remove
the spoil and renew the baits when necessary.
Two hundred hooks may be used
on the same line, and the pooka at times affords
much amusement, and often a well-filled
pannier.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Powder Flask</span>, <i>s.</i> A flask to hold powder.</p>

<p class='c006'>To obviate the danger of the powder being
inflamed and communicated to that in the
flask whilst loading, have a brass top made to
go over that which screws on the flask, and
which the opening of the spring supplies from
it; by putting the charge of powder into the
detached brass covering, and from that pouring
it into the barrel; should there be any tow,
after cleaning and flashing off some powder, or,
after discharging, any wadding remaining on
fire within, (which last may happen when
paper, but never can when hat or leather wadding
is used,) the whole of the powder that
can explode will be the single charge in the
brass covering.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Egg and Mr. Sykes have each got patents
for powder flasks, in which, if a charge
is blown up, all communication is so effectually
prevented, that no farther damage can be
done. I have seen the one of Mr. Egg repeatedly
tried by himself. To do this, he
dropped a red hot nail into the barrel, which,
of course, instantly fired the measure put into
it. He then unscrewed the top, and showed
me the remainder of the powder in the horn,
having only guarded his right hand by a shield
of pasteboard, to avoid being burnt by the
charge from the barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principle of it is so secure as to render
it impossible for the powder in the flask to
ignite, while in the act of loading, by the passage
being completely cut off, from the lever
being placed on the top of a strong plate instead
of underneath. It also prevents the
flash out of the barrel from injuring the hand,
as the charger is fixed in an octant position,
with a vent to let out the flame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The springs of these powder horns must be
kept very clean and free, or, like many ingenious
patents, they will fall victims to the
abuse of slovenly sportsmen. Mr. Egg says,
he “begs leave to caution gentlemen of a
trumpery Sheffield flask (sold in the shops),
with an upright charger, not being calculated
to answer the purpose intended, though it is
an infringement on his patent.”—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Powderhorn</span>, <i>s.</i> A horn case in which powder is kept for guns.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to your horn, the best thing you can
do, when it remains pretty full at the end of
a day, is to leave it in a very dry place in a
warm room. For my own part, being persuaded
that so much depends upon this, I
always have my powder packed in half-pounds,
a spare one of which I usually carry
about me, and never open it until my horn is
empty; and I am certain that more depends
upon the quality and state of the powder than
is usually ascribed to it.—<i>Hints to Sportsmen.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Powdermill</span>, <i>s.</i> The mill in which the ingredients for gunpowder are
ground and mingled.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Powder Prover</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Powder Prover.</i>—The proper “epreuvette”
is very correctly made; the wheel on
which the gradations are marked is large, and
the spring strong, consequently the resistance
to the force of the powder is considerable.
The stronger it is the better; for without the
resistance is strong, a correct proof cannot be
obtained; because if not sufficiently strong to
detain the powder in the chamber long enough
for all the particles to ignite, many of them
(especially in powder of good firm grain) will
fly off unburnt, and of course a part only of
the charge would be proved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The part attached to the wheel of the
epreuvette, which shuts the mouth of the
chamber, should be so nicely adjusted, that
on looking closely at the parts when in contact,
no light can be seen between them; for
if any light, there is of course so much vacancy,
and consequently so much windage;
and in proportion to the windage the proof
will be lower, and therefore incorrect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three fires at least should always be made
in proving, and the average taken as the mean
amount, for variations frequently happen in
fires immediately following each other, although
made with considerable attention.
Care should be taken after every fire to clean
the chamber nicely, or otherwise the foulness
left by the preceding discharge would lessen
the space, by which the succeeding charge
would become proportionally less.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Precipitate</span>, <i>s.</i> A corrosive medicine made by precipitating mercury.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red precipitate, nitric oxide of mercury, or

an efficacious remedy in foul ulcers. It may be
used alone, finely powdered and sprinkled on
the affected part; or mixed with various ointments.
It is made from quicksilver and nitrous
acid, but is considerably weaker than a
solution of that metal in nitrous acid. It becomes,
however, a strong and very efficacious
caustic, when dissolved in nitrous acid. This
solution may also be mixed with unctuous substances,
forming with them good <i>detergent

so as to form a detergent lotion of considerable

<p class='c006'><i>To preserve Birds.</i>—Large birds should
be carefully skinned; the head, tail, and feet,
left entire. The skin may then be either put
into a vessel of spirits, or rubbed well on the
inside with the following mixture:—One
pound of salt, four ounces of alum, and two
ounces of pepper, pounded together. Small
birds may be thus treated:—Take out the
entrails, open a passage to the brain, which
should be scooped out through the mouth;
introduce into the cavities of the skull and
the whole body some of the above mixture,
putting it also through the gullet and entire
length of the neck; hang the bird in a cool,
airy place, first by the feet, that the body may
be impregnated by the salts, and afterwards
by a thread through the under mandible of
the bill, till it appears to be sweet; then expose
it in the sun, or near a fire. After it is
well dried, clean out what remains loose of
the mixture, and fill the cavity of the body
with wool, oakum, or any soft substance.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If you shoot a curious bird, and have not
the means of getting it stuffed while fresh,
you may preserve the skin of it for many
months by putting therein dry tow and powdered
ginger. May and June are the only
months that you need fear the moth; and
just then cedar shavings or camphor would
be a good addition. To skin a bird, open him

<p class='c006'><i>Proof of Barrels.</i>—There has been lately
cast in the foundery at Ruelle, near Angoulême,
a cannon, after a model differing a little
from that formerly adopted, and which has
been submitted to an extraordinary trial,
called “proof to the utmost.” This trial,
the result of which was to burst the piece, was
composed of two series, one of fifty, the other
of fifty-seven shots, in which the charge was
successively increased, so that the quantity of
powder in the charge was raised to twenty-eight
pounds instead of six, and the number
of balls amounted to twelve. For the last
six shots they succeeded in filling the barrel
entirely with clay over the balls; and besides,
in some of the last shots they secured
each by four iron wedges, fastened on in such
a manner that the number of these wedges
was sixteen for the 106th shot, and as many
for the last.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Prophylactic</span>, <i>s.</i> A preventive against canine madness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oldest prophylactic with which we are
acquainted is suction. We have very ancient
records of its employment, and, if we
can believe these legends, a particular family
enjoyed the privilege, or devoted themselves
to this process of drawing, by the application
of the mouth to the wound, the poison inserted
by a venomous animal. A ligature
has also been recommended to stop the progress
of the rabid poison, but, according to
the present theories, it can have no preventive
efficacy whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cold-bathing, but particularly sea-bathing,
as a preventive, is a practice also of great antiquity,
and, even yet, the uninformed classes
place implicit reliance on it. Its incapability
of insuring safety was, however, early noted;
and Palmerius, Ambrose Parey, Desault, and
others, were at much pains to discredit the
practice: nevertheless, both hot and cold
bathing long retained some powerful advocates.
However respectable the authorities
in its favour, the lamentable experience of
many who have trusted to its efficacy, even
when performed, as Van Swieten has it, <i>ad
sufficationem usque</i>, but too well proves.
Among the well informed, therefore, no reliance
is now placed on it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mercury has long been employed as a prophylactic.
Sauvages must have been greatly
deceived by its ill-deserved reputation. Sir
G. Cobb’s famous Tonquin remedy, so highly
extolled by Claude Duchoisee, in India, was
prepared from the native and factitious cinnabars,
with musk. Turpeth mineral, which is
a sub-sulphate of this metal, was highly extolled
by Tissot, and has been very generally
used among the dogs of this country. Many
other authorities of note have extolled the
preventive efficacy of mercury, from its power
in counteracting the effects of the syphilitic
poison; but as it has entirely failed in man
and beast, under every advantage of administration,
so it has ceased to be relied on as
solely sufficient to guard the constitution.
Neither has arsenic any more claim to the
character of a preventive than it has as a curative.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Mead’s <i>pulvis antilyssus</i>, composed
of lichen cinereus and black pepper, has wholly
lost its reputation, although, during his practice,
he expressed a wish that he knew as
certain a preventive for any other disease.
The Ormskirk remedy is also another striking
proof how easily a reputation may be gained,
and how undeservedly: for although palpable
instances of its failure are numerous, it once
enjoyed great reputation, and is even yet occasionally
trusted to. The water plantain
(alisma plantago) has also proved one of those
unfortunate articles offered to notice, which
only served to raise hopes it was doomed
never to realise. As it came recommended
by a Russian counsellor of state, M. Jalowsky,
at the express direction of his government, it
met with a cordial reception, and a full trial
in England and elsewhere, but everywhere it
proved fallacious, both as a preventive and
cure.</p>

<p class='c006'>To enumerate all the other articles, particularly
of the vegetable world, that at some
period or other have been deemed prophylactics,
would be endless. Among the most
popular we may mention the eglantine, or

<p class='c006'>The puffin weighs about twelve ounces, and
measures twelve inches in length, and twenty-one
in breadth. Its singular bill looks not
unlike a kind of sheath slipped over both
mandibles; and, from its appearance, the bird
is not improperly named coulterneb, or knife-bill.
At the base, where it is about an inch
and a half in depth, it is rimmed with a white
callous border, the two corners of which project
above the brow, and below the chin. It
is about the same in length, curved towards
the point, compressed vertically, very flat,
and transversely furrowed on the sides; the
half of it adjoining to the head is smooth,
and of a fine lead-coloured blue; the other
part, to the tip, red: the nostrils are placed
in long narrow slits, near the edge of the bill;
the corners of the mouth, when closed, are
curiously puckered, and form a kind of small
star, or rose; the eyes are protected by small
callous protuberances, both above and below;
the edges of the eye-lids are crimson; irides
grey; the chin and cheeks are white, bordered
with grey—the latter much puffed up with
feathers, which makes the head look large
and round. From behind the corner of each
eye the feathers are curiously separated, forming
a narrow line, which reaches to the hinder
part of the head: the crown of the head,
hinder part of the neck, and upper part of
the plumage, are black, and a collar of the
same colour encircles the neck; the under
parts are white; the tail consists of sixteen
feathers; the legs are reddish orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>The puffin, like others of the same genus,
takes wing with great difficulty, and walks
upon the whole length of the leg and foot,
with a wriggling awkward gait. In tempestuous
weather it takes shelter in caverns and
holes in the nearest rocks, or in those made
by the rabbit on the beach among the bent
grass, in which it sits dozing, in snug security,
till the return of the calm weather; for these
birds cannot brave the storm, and it is not
uncommon, when they have been overtaken
by it, to find them drowned and cast on shore.
Various kinds of fish, such as small crabs,
shrimps, sprats, and also seaweeds, are said to
be the food upon which they live; but it is
evident from the structure, great strength,
and sharpness of the bill, that they are furnished
with powers to crush and pluck out
other kinds of shell-fish, which ornithologists
have not noticed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes no nest; she deposits
her single whitish-coloured egg upon the bare
mould, in a hole, dug out and formed in the
ground, by her mate and herself, for that purpose;
or in those which they find ready made
by the rabbits, whom they easily dislodge.
The parent birds are very attentive to their
young, which they will defend to the last, by
severely biting whatever enemy attempts to
molest them, and will suffer themselves to be
taken rather than desert them: and yet, notwithstanding
this uncommon attachment, when
the day of migration comes, the young, which
are not able to fly, are left behind, and mostly
perish of want, or are destroyed by birds of
prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bite of these birds is very severe: one
sent to the author in a box, covered with netting,
caught hold of the finger of a poor man,
and brought away the fleshy part, as if it had
been cut out with a knife; but they may be
tamed, and soon become familiar. They are
fed on fish and other animal substances.—These
birds are spread over various parts of
the northern world, and are met with on almost
all the rocky cliffs on the coasts of Britain
and Ireland, and on many of the surrounding
isles, in immense numbers. They
congregate in flocks of magnitude, regulated
by the accommodations afforded them at their
breeding places, at which they first assemble
early in April, but do not settle to prepare
for the business of incubation till May. They
hatch their young in the beginning of July;
from which time until nearly the middle of
August, they are employed in returning and
rearing their brood: when this is accomplished,
the whole associated swarm leaves
the place at once, and pursues its route to
other regions, more suited to their future
exigencies, there to spend the remainder of
the varied year.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Astonishing emigration of puffins.</i>—A
most extraordinary event took place at the
great island of Arran, lying at the mouth of
the bay leading to Galway, in Ireland, some
years ago. The stupendous cliffs to the southwest
of the island, which, from time immemorial,
had been the place of resort, or rather
the natural habitation of such numbers of rock-birds
or puffins, as is almost incredible, were
at once deserted, on the 24th of June, by
that entire species of fowl, which abandoned
their nests, eggs, and young ones, and went
off to sea. The like incident is said to have
happened forty years before, and no reason
whatever could be assigned for these most extraordinary
derelictions.</p>

<p class='c006'>This variety is so nearly allied to the bull-dog
(from which he is descended by a cross
with the small Danish) in form and general
appearance, that a detailed description is quite
unnecessary. The chief difference is in its
size, being much smaller, and its tail curled
upon its back. It differs extremely in another
particular, which is in courage, this animal
being as timid as the other is valiant.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog was formerly very common in
many parts of Great Britain, but is now becoming
very scarce, from the circumstance,
we have no doubt, of its being so useless. It
may be prized as a pet, but certainly not for
its beauty. Although its admirers in this
country are becoming very limited in number,
we are informed by Mrs. Piozzi, that in
Italy it is a great favourite, more particularly
at Padua.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Punt Shooting.</i>—The punt shooters (men
who earn their livelihood in winter by attacking
the wild fowl, night and day, according
as the tide serves) kill great numbers. The
pursuit is hazardous, especially when there is
much ice in the river, by which they sometimes
get encircled, and then can only float
with the current, and are kept often two or
three tides before they can extricate themselves,
and their punt is ill calculated to sustain
pressure against its sides, which are not
twenty inches high from the surface of the
water; in this the punter by night drops
down with the tide, or uses his paddles after
the fowl; he knows their haunts, and takes
every advantage of wind, tide, moon, &amp;c.;
his gun, which carries as much as a little
cannon, is laid with the muzzle over the stem
of the punt, in a hitch, which regulates the
line of aim: at the bottom of the punt he
lies upon his belly, and gets as near the
rout of fowl that are upon the water as possible;
when within the range of his gun, he
rattles with his feet against the bottom of
his punt, and when the fowl begin to spring
at this unexpected sound, at that moment he
pulls the trigger, and cuts a lane through
their ranks, he instantly follows the direction
of his shot, and gathers up those that
are killed, or just expiring, for very seldom
he makes it answer to row after fowl only
wounded. He then charges his gun, and drifts
further down the river, in hopes of a second,
third, and successive shots. By this mode a
man has brought home from fourscore to an
hundred wild fowls, of various kinds, in one
night’s excursion; and this will not seem an
exaggerated account, when the multitudes
which, in hard frosty weather, with the wind
at east or north-east, haunt the Blackwater
river are known. The numbers that are
seen in their day-flights, and the noises of
the various kinds of a night, are almost beyond
belief: to the compiler, prepared as he
was to behold amazing quantities, they exhibited
far beyond what he was led to expect,
and to others who have seen their throngs,
the astonishment has been perhaps still greater.
A punt shooter of the name of Bowles, has
been known to clear upwards of an hundred
pounds in a season by his gun; the wild fowl
were sold to the higlers, &amp;c., at two shillings
a couple, one with the other; allowing his
expenses to be only thirty pounds, here were
two thousand six hundred birds brought home;
an immense destruction, when the whole
period allotted for it does not much exceed five
months. Forty-two wigeons have been killed
at a single shot in the day-time, and the
difficulty of approaching the great flocks of
fowl in the light is tenfold. A man, in
whose punt the compiler was, got eighteen
wigeons at one shot, and many that were
crippled, escaped. If in the day, or at night,
the punters get a shot at the fowl at feed
upon the ooze, they tie on their plashes
(similar to the mud-pattens used in Hampshire),
and collect their spoil.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best time for this shooting is the first
or second day’s thaw after a sharp frost, and
when deep snow has long covered the ground;
the fowl are then flying in every direction to
dabble in the fresh water, which then appears
all around inviting them. Another favourable
opportunity is at the commencement of
a frost, with the wind strong at east, and a
sleet or snow falling: if the guns can but be
kept dry, there is no complaint about the
using them, and the fowl in such weather
always fly lower than when the atmosphere is
clear.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pup</span>, <i>v.</i> To bring forth whelps, used of a bitch bringing young.</p>

<p class='c006'>All dogs that are much domesticated and
confined, appear particularly subject to difficulty
in bringing forth; consequently during
pregnancy much exercise should be given, as
nothing tends more to easy parturition than
full exercise. Sometimes the constitution
itself, in these tender and artificial breeds, is
not equal to the exertion of labour; and sometimes
false presentation increases the obstruction.
Whenever a difficulty in pupping occurs,
which has existed more than four or
five hours, the bitch should be examined by
means of a finger passed up the vagina; and,
if any portion of a pup should be found to
present itself, so as to be within reach of the
finger, a skein of worsted ought, if possible, to
be fastened around it; and, during the throes,
or labour pains of the animal, it should be
gently drawn away. If it cannot be reached
in this way, a little longer time may be allowed;
but, after all, should it not advance,
a pair of forceps may be used to assist the
extraction. It is a good practice to give a
laxative as soon as any symptoms of pupping
appear; and, when delivery seems much delayed,
it will be prudent, in all cases, to bathe
in warm water, and to give nutriment if the
labour is protracted: occasional doses of laudanum
united with æther must be given if
any convulsive appearances come on. The
patience of bitches in labour is extreme, and
their distress, if not relieved, is most striking
and affecting. Their look is, at such times,
particularly expressive, and apparently imploring.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Put</span>, <i>s.</i> A clown; a vulgar game at cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Put, played with a complete pack, generally
by two people, sometimes by three, and often
by four, is a game at which the cards rank differently
from all others, tray being the best,
next the deuce, then ace, king, and so on in
the usual order, as at whist. After cutting for
deal, &amp;c., at which the highest put card wins,
three cards, by one at a time, are given to each
player, then the game is played in the following
way. If the non-dealer throw up his cards
he loses a point; if he play, and the dealer do
not lay down another to it, he gains a point;
but should the dealer either win the same, pass
it, or lay down one of equal value, forming
what is styled a tie, the non-dealer is still at
liberty to put, that is play, or not, and his opponent
then only gains a point; then if both
parties agree to go on, whoever gains all the
tricks or two out of three, wins five points,
which are the game; if each player win one
trick, and the third be a tie, then neither party
scores.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four-handed put differs only in this, that
on both sides, one of the players gives his best
card to his partner, who lays out one in lieu of
it, and the game is afterwards played as in two-handed
put.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the dealer turn up any of his adversary’s
cards in dealing another deal may be demanded;
but if he turn up his own he is to abide by it.
Should a faced card occur, the pack must be
shuffled and dealt again. When more cards
than necessary are given to the non-dealer, he
may either claim a fresh deal, or have the extra
cards drawn; but should the dealer give
himself too many, then his opponent is entitled
to a point, and may either have another
deal, or draw the supernumerary cards. Bystanders
ought never to interfere, under penalty
of paying the stakes. Either party saying, I
put, must abide the event of the game, or pay
the stakes.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The game of quadrille is played by four
persons, with forty cards; the four tens, nines,

deal is made by distributing the cards to each
player, three at a time, for two rounds, and
once four to each, beginning with the right-hand
player, who is the elder hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stakes, consisting of several equal billets
or contracts, comprising the counters and fish,
are distributed among the players, who agree
upon the value thereof, and upon the number of
tours, which are usually ten. After the trump
is named, the right-hand player leads, and
should the ombre, either alone or with a friend,
win all the tricks, he gains the vole, or, if six
tricks, the game; but if he get only five tricks
he loses by remise, and if only four, by codill.
The game, consolation, matadores, bastos, and
other payments, are variously regulated, according
as the game is won or lost. The
holder of either or both of the red aces, is
entitled to a fish for each.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SOME SHORT RULES FOR LEARNERS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. When you are the ombre, and your
friend leads from a mat, play your best trump,
and then lead the next best the first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If you possess all the trumps, keep leading
them, except you have other certain winning
cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If all the mats should not be revealed
by the time you have won six tricks, do not
risk playing for the vole.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When you are the friend called, and
hold only a mat, lead it, but if only a mat,
guarded by a small trump, lead the small one;
though when the ombre is last player, lead the
best trump you have.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Punto in red, or king of trumps in
black, are good cards to lead when they are
your best, and should either of them succeed,
then play a small trump.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When the ombre leads to discover the
friend, if you hold king, queen, and knave,
put on the knave.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Preserve the called suit, whether friend
or foe.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. When playing against a lone hand,
never lead a king, unless you have the queen,
nor change the suit, nor permit, if possible to
prevent it, the ombre to be last player.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Call on the strongest suits, except you
have a queen guarded, and, if elder hand, you
have a better chance than when middle hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. A good player may succeed better with
a weaker hand, when either elder or younger,
than if middle hand.</p>

<p>THE QUAIL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of the quail is seven inches and
a half. Bill dusky; eyes hazel; the colours
of the head, neck, and back, are of a mixture
of brown, ash-colour, and black; over each
eye there is a yellow streak, and another of
the same colour down the middle of the forehead;
a dark line passes from each corner of
the bill, forming a kind of forget above the
breast; the scapular feathers are marked by
a light yellowish streak down the middle of
each; the quills are of a lightish brown, with
small rust-coloured bands on the exterior of
the feathers; the breast is of a pale rust-colour,
spotted with black, and streaked with
pale yellow; the tail consists of twelve feathers,
barred like the wings; the belly and
thighs are of a yellowish white; the legs pale
brown. The female wants the black spots on
the breast, and is easily distinguished by a less
vivid plumage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quails are almost universally diffused
throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa; they
are birds of passage, and are seen in immense
flocks traversing the Mediterranean Sea, from
Europe to the shores of Africa, in the autumn,
and returning again in the spring, frequently
alighting, in their passage, on many of the
islands of the Archipelago, which they almost
cover with their numbers. On the western
coasts of the kingdom of Naples, such prodigious
numbers have appeared, that an hundred
thousand have been taken in a day, within
the space of four or five miles. From these
circumstances it appears highly probable that
the quails which supplied the Israelites with
food, during their journey through the wilderness,
were sent thither on their passage to
the north, by a wind from the south-west,
sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia, towards
the shores of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quails are not very numerous here; they
breed with us, and many of them are said to
remain throughout the year, changing their
quarters from the interior counties to the sea
coast. The female makes her nest like the
partridge, and lays to the number of six or
seven eggs of a greyish colour, speckled with
brown. The young birds follow the mother
as soon as hatched, but do not continue long
together: they are scarcely grown up before
they separate; or, if kept together, they fight
obstinately with each other, their quarrels frequently
terminating in each others’ destruction.
From this quarrelsome disposition in
the quail, it was that they were formerly made
use of by the Greeks and Romans, as we use
game-cocks, for the purpose of fighting. We
are told that Augustus punished a præfect of
Egypt with death, for bringing to his table one
of these birds, which had acquired celebrity
by its victories. At this time the Chinese
are much addicted to fighting quails: in some
parts of Italy it is likewise said to be no uncommon
practice. After feeding two quails
very highly, they place them opposite to each
other, and throw a few grains of seed between
them; the birds rush upon each other with
the utmost fury, striking with their bills and
heels till one of them yields.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In our way down to the beach, we observed
a number of high poles erected at small distances
in the low grounds. These the lad told
us served to stretch their nets upon in the
quail season. Capri has in all ages been celebrated
for the prodigious number of quails
caught there. The principal revenues of the
bishop and of some convents, arise from the
quails they send to Naples. In a good season,
which lasts about three weeks only, 150,000,
and in one day 12,000 have been taken. As
birds of passage, they alight here merely to
rest themselves in their flight to other countries;
begin arriving in April, and continue
till the middle of May. That period is a
time of profit and rejoicing for the Capreans,
every one being at liberty to shoot or catch
as many as he can. Exhausted as the bird is,
there is little difficulty in seizing him. The
most common and productive method is, for
one man to have a net, which he carries
folded up on two poles, another drives the
quails towards him, when the former instantly
expands his net, and as soon as the birds strike
against it, he turns the net with great dexterity,
and confines them entangled as they
are. They are then put into a bag, to preserve
them alive, because the live ones fetch
a double price at Naples. Very often, however,
this pastime is attended with serious
consequences; the bearer of the net, in twisting
it round, frequently loses his balance,
from the weight of the long poles, and is precipitated
from the rocks. Even boys from
the age of four amuse themselves by catching
them with the hand in the bushes, and putting
them under the netting which they constantly
wear on their heads; and on their return
home, the height of this <i>animated</i> head dress,
as it affords the best proof of their success, is
a matter of triumph among them. In Egypt,
when these birds arrive in the month of September,
I have more than once seen the
Arabs killing and laming them, by throwing
short sticks at them. During the time that
the Capitani Bey blockaded the harbour of
Alexandria with his Turkish squadron, one of
the Greek sailors of his ship had caught two
or three which had perched on the rigging.
The mussulman rewarded him generously,
and desirous of varying the hard fare which a
blockading squadron has usually to sustain,
by a more ample supply of such a delicate rarity,
promised a piastre for every quail that
should be brought him. In a few days the
rigging, sails, and yards were covered with
flocks of quails; great numbers were caught
of course, and every one was brought into the
cabin, as the price had been so liberally fixed.
To escape the dilemma of either ruining his
purse or breaking his promise, the Capitani
Bey resorted to the alternative of standing
out to sea, as by removing from the coast he
got rid of the visits of these expensive strangers.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In January, 1806, Lord Fitzharris was returning
from shooting, when close to the sea
his dogs pointed, and he shot a quail; in the
same field he killed a brace more, these consisted
of a male, female, and young bird; they
were fat and in exceeding good condition, and
it was conjectured that the old birds had been
disabled from pursuing their autumnal migration.
A similar incident not having occurred
to any sportsman, in that part of England, in
some measure accounts for Mr. Pennant’s remark
(which he made for its singularity), of
a quail being shot in Kent, during the winter
of 1781.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Letters from

which the dealer gives one card to his adversary

his card, he has a right to have as many more

a five, which make seven, he should go on, in
hopes of coming nearer to 15; if he then
draw an eight, which makes just 15, and be
elder-hand, he is sure of winning the game:
but should he over-draw, and make above 15,
he loses, unless the dealer does the same, in

<p>THE RABBIT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Rabbit-keeping is practised by a few individuals
in almost every town, and by a few in
almost every part of the country; but thirty
or forty years ago, there were one or two very
considerable feeders near the metropolis, keeping
each, according to report, from fifteen hundred
to two thousand breeding does. These
large concerns have ceased, it seems, long
since, and London receives the supply of tame
as well as wild rabbits, chiefly from the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only considerable rabbit-feeders of
whom I heard, some years since, were two
gentlemen, the one resident in Oxfordshire,
the other in Berks. The former fed some
hundreds, and then, it was said, intended to
double his stock. The huts were placed in a
small building set apart for that purpose. The
then stock produced one load of dung per
week, two loads of which were sufficient to
manure an acre of land. Three dozen of rabbits
per week were sent to the London market,
but keep and attendance reckoned, no other
profit accrued, excepting the dung, the price
of which used to be eight-pence per bushel,
and I believe thirty-six bushels are reckoned
a load. The Berks gentleman, according to
the survey of that county, fed white rabbits,
on account of the superior value of their skins,
from their application of late years to the purpose
of trimmings. Twenty does and two
bucks were my largest stock.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The rabbit-house should stand upon a dry
foundation, and be well ventilated. Exposure
to too much humidity, whether externally or
internally, is fatal to rabbits, which are liable
to the rot like sheep, and from the same causes.
The rains of 1799, which continued nearly
four months, destroyed my stock of rabbits,
which were hutted in a boarded shed, not well
defended from the cold and moist air. Ventilation
and fresh air are also necessary, where
considerable numbers of these animals are
kept, which will not else remain healthy, or
prosper for any length of time: and even sudden
mortality may ensue, from impure and
stagnant air. A thorough draught or passage
for the air is thence indispensable, and should
be contrived in the building, with the convenience
of shutting such opposite windows or
doors in cold and wet weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>The huts or hutches are generally placed
one above another, to the height required by
the number of rabbits, and the extent of the
room. Where a large stock is kept, to make
the most of room, the hutches may be placed
in rows, with a sufficient interval between, for
feeding and cleaning, instead of being joined
to the wall, in the usual way. It is preferable
to rest the hutches upon stands, about a foot
above the ground, for the convenience of cleaning
under them. Each of the hutches, intended
for breeding, should have two rooms,
a feeding and a bed-room. Those are single
for the use of the weaned rabbits, or for the
bucks, which are always kept separate.</p>

<p class='c006'>When much green meat is given, rabbits
make a considerable quantity of urine, and I
have sometimes seen occasion to set the hutches
sloping backwards a few degrees, a very small
aperture being made the whole length of the
floor, to carry off the urine. A sliding door
in the partition between the two rooms, is
convenient for confining the rabbits during the
operation of cleaning; which, indeed, is a good
argument for having all the hutches double, it
being more troublesome to clean out a room
with a number of rabbits in it, than with only
one. It must not be forgotten, that the teeth
of rabbits are very effectual implements of
destruction to any thing not hard enough to
resist them, and their troughs should be bound
with something less penetrable than wood.
As they are apt to scratch out their food, and
dung in it, I have often thought it might be
useful to adopt the feeding troughs with moveable
boards, as well for rabbits as hogs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The floor of the hutches should be planed
smooth, that wet may run off, and a common
hoe with a short handle, and a short broom,
are most convenient implements for cleaning
these houses. The object being to obtain the
dung pure, for sale, no litter should be allowed;
but on a farm where the dung is expended at
home, the hutches should be littered with refuse
hay or straw, perfectly dry. The rabbit-house
to contain a tub for the dung, and a bin
for a day’s supply of hay, corn, roots, or other
food, which should be given in as fresh a state
as possible.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>As to the varieties of form and colour, in
the rabbit, the short-legged, with width and
substance of loin, generally few in number,
and to be obtained only by selection, are the
most hardy, and fatten most expeditiously,
taking on fat both internally and in the muscular
flesh. They have, besides, the soundest
livers—the rabbits being generally subject to
defects of the liver: they are the smallest
variety. There is a very large variety of the
hare colour, having much bone, length and
depth of carcase, large and long ears, with large
eyes, resembling those of the hare. They
might well be taken for hybrid or mules, but
from the objection of their breeding. Their
flesh is high coloured, substantial, and more
savoury than that of the common rabbit; and
they make a good dish, cooked like the hare,
which, at six or eight months old, they nearly
equal in size. The large white, and yellow
and white species, have whiter and more delicate
flesh, and, cooked in the same way, will
rival the turkey.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to colour, I have always preferred
the wild colour, and black, finding the
skins of full as much worth as the white.
The Turkish or French rabbit, with long white
fur, differs little from the common varieties; nor
did I find their skins of more value, either for
sale or home use. I have been in the habit of
drying the skins, for linings of night-gowns,
and other domestic purposes; but have always
found reason to prefer the short, close fur.
The large above-mentioned—indeed any peculiar
varieties—must be sought among the
London dealers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of late years, in London, the term <i>smut</i>,
has been applied as a mark of distinction in
the rabbit. Thus, there are single and double
smuts. The smut consists of a black spot on
the side of the rabbit’s nose: when there are
two black spots, one on each side of the nose,
it constitutes a double smut. Generally, the
rabbits are prized for the number of these black
spots upon the head and body, and for the fineness
and length and size of the ears, which
occasions their falling about the head, in a
manner different from the common rabbit.
Black and tortoise-shell are the favourite
colours.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Rabbits are divided into four kinds—<i>warreners</i>,
<i>parkers</i>, <i>hedgehogs</i>, and <i>sweethearts</i>.
Burrowing under ground is favourable, it appears,
to the growth of fur; and the warrener,
though a member of a subterraneous city, is
less effeminate than his kindred who roam
more at large. His fur is most esteemed, and
after him comes the parker, whose favourite
haunt is a gentleman’s pleasure-ground, where
he usually breeds in great numbers, and not
unfrequently drives the hares away. The
hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit, that
travels, tinker-like, throughout the country,
and would be better clad if he remained more
at home. Sweethearts are tame rabbits, and
their fur, though sleek, is too silky and soft
to be of much use in the important branch of
hat-making.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Breeding.</i>—The doe will breed at the age
of six months, and her period of gestation is
thirty or thirty-one days. It should be premised,
that the buck and doe are by no means
to be left together; but their union having
been successful, the buck must be immediately
withdrawn, and the doe tried again in three
days: in fact, with rabbits, this business is
conducted on the same principle as in the stud.
Like chickens, the best breeding rabbits are
those kindled in March. Some days before
parturition, or kindling, hay is to be given to
the doe, to assist in making her bed, with the
flue, which nature has instructed her to tear
from her body for that purpose. She will be
at this period seen sitting upon her haunches,
and tearing off the flue, and the hay being
presented to her, she will, with her teeth, reduce
and shorten it to her purpose.—Biting
down of the litter or bed, is the first sign of
approaching pregnancy. The number produced,
generally between five and ten; and
it is most advantageous always to destroy the
weak or sickly ones, as soon as their defects
can be perceived, because five healthy and
well-grown rabbits are worth more than double
the number of an opposite description, and
the doe will be far less exhausted. She will
admit the buck again with profit at the end of
six weeks, when the young may be separated
from her and weaned. Or the young may be
suckled two months, the doe taking the buck
at the end of five weeks, so that the former
litter will leave her about a week before her
next parturition.</p>

<p class='c006'>A notion was formerly prevalent, of the
necessity for giving the buck immediately after
the doe had brought forth, lest she should
pine, and that no time might be lost; and if
it were intended that no time might be lost in
destroying the doe, such, indeed, would be the
most successful method. Great care should
be taken that the doe, during her gestation,
be not approached by the buck, or indeed by
any other rabbit; as, from being harassed
about, she will almost certainly cast her young.
One doe in a thousand may devour her young;
a sign that she ought to be otherwise disposed
of. Some does admit the buck with
difficulty, although often apparently in season;
such should be immediately fattened off, since
it can never be worth while to keep an objectionable
individual for breeding, of a stock to
be produced in such multitudes. Should the
doe be weak on her bringing forth, from cold
caught or other cause, she will drink beer-caudle,
as well as any other lady; or warm
fresh grains will comfort her; a malt mash;
scalded fine pollard, or barley-meal, in which
may be mixed a small quantity of cordial
horse-ball.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feeding.</i>—Upon a regular plan, and with
sufficient attendance, it is better to feed three
times than twice a day. The art of feeding
rabbits with safety and advantage is, always to
give the upper-hand to dry and substantial
food. Their nature is congenial with that of
the sheep, and the same kind of food, with
little variation, agrees with both. All weeds,
and the refuse of vegetation, should be banished
from rabbit feeding. Such articles are
too washy and diuretic, and can never be
worth attention, whilst the more solid and nutritious
productions of the field may be obtained
in such plenty, and will return so much
greater profit. Rabbits may, indeed, be kept,
and even fattened upon roots, good green
meat, and hay; but they will pay for corn;
and this may be taken as a general rule.
Rabbits which have as much corn as they will
eat, can never take any harm from being indulged
with almost an equal portion of good
substantial vegetables. However, the test of
health is, that their dung be not too moist.
Many, or most, of the town feeders never allow
any greens at all; the reason, I suppose,
because they feed almost entirely on grains.
The corn proper for rabbits:—oats, peas,
wheat; pollard, and some give buck-wheat,
The greens and roots, the same as our cattle
crops, namely carrots, Jerusalem artichokes,
and if potatoes, baked or steamed. Lucerne,
cabbage-leaves, clover, tares, furze. I have
had them hoven, from eating rape; and not
improbably, mangold might have a similar
effect. Clover and meadow-hay, pea and bean
straw.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rabbits are generally sold from the teat,
but there is also a demand for those of larger
size, which may be fattened upon corn and
hay, with an allowance of the best vegetables.
The better the food, the greater weight, better
quality, and more profit, which I apprehend to
be generally the case in the breeding of all
animals. Some fatten with fresh grains and
pollard. I have tried all wheat, and all potato
oats, comparatively; but could find no
difference in the goodness of the flesh. The
rabbit’s flesh being dry, the allowance of
succulent greens may tend to render it
more juicy; and I suppose the old complaint
of the dryness of the flesh in Devon
beef, entirely fed by hay, might be remedied
in the same way. Rabbits are in perfection
for feeding at the fourth or sixth month; beyond
which period their flesh becomes more
dry, and somewhat hard. It requires three
months, or nearly so, to make a rabbit thoroughly
fat and ripe; half the time may make
them eatable, but by no means equal in the
quality of the flesh. They may yet be over
fattened, as appears by specimens exhibited a
few years since, at Lord Somerville’s show,
which were loaded with fat, without and within,
like the best feeding sheep; and at the
late London cattle show, two were exhibited,
one of them exceeding the weight of fifteen
pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Castrated rabbits might be fattened, no
doubt, to the weight of upwards of ten, or
even fifteen pounds, at six or seven months
old. The operation should be performed at
the age of six or seven weeks. I have not
succeeded in castrating the rabbit, but am informed
it is successfully practised in the land
of capons, namely, Sussex, near Chichester,
where on the average, not one in three hundred
is lost by the operation, which is performed
at five or six weeks old.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In slaughtering full-grown rabbits, after the
usual stroke upon the neck, the throat should
be perforated upwards, towards the jaws, with
a small-pointed knife, in order that the blood
may be evacuated, which would otherwise
settle in the head and neck. It is an abomination
to kill poultry by the slow and torturing
method of bleeding to death, hung up
by the heels, the veins of the mouth being
cut; but still more so the rabbit, which in that
situation utters horrible screams. The entrails
of the rabbit, whilst fresh, are said to be good
food for fish, being thrown into ponds.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>By 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. if any person unlawfully

at the commencement of this article, that the
large concerns had generally ceased. Of late,
one has arisen at Ampthill, Beds; upon a more
extensive scale than ever before attempted,
established by J. H. Fisher, Esq., an agent of
his Grace the Duke of Bedford. Upon so
extensive a plan, indeed, is this new undertaking,
that it may well be styled our grand
National Rabbit Bazaar. The building, situated
upon an eminence, is square, somewhat
resembling barracks, with a court withinside
the walls, and with thirty acres of fine light
land adjoining, under culture of those crops
known to be best adapted to the nourishment
and support of rabbit-stock. It was proposed
to keep between four and five thousand breeding
does, which number is probably now complete.
The young rabbits, from seven to nine
weeks old, are sent to Newgate and Leadenhall
markets, fifty to sixty dozens, weekly.
The quantity of dung produced, which is reserved
with the utmost care, and free from
any extraneous substances, must be very considerable.
A number of men and boys are
employed in the concern, under the direction
of an experienced foreman, and the utmost
regularity of attention observed with respect
to management, feeding, and cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bazaar has been honoured by the visits
of persons of the highest rank; of his Royal
Highness the Duke of Clarence, his Grace
the Duke of Bedford, Lord Holland, Lord
Vernon, and a number of ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The wold warreners catch their rabbits with
fold-nets, with spring-nets, and with “tipes,”
a species of trap.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fold-nets are set about midnight, between
the burrows and the feeding grounds;
the rabbits being driven in with dogs, and kept
inclosed in the fold until morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spring-net is generally laid round a haystack,
or other object of inducement for rabbits
to collect in numbers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tipe or trap is a more modern invention;
it consists of a large pit or cistern, covered with
a floor, with a small trap door nicely balanced,
near its meuse. It used to be set by a haystack,
but since turnips are now grown for the
winter food, in an inclosure within the warren,
the trap is placed within the wall of this inclosure.
For a night or two the rabbits are suffered
to go through the meuse, and over the
trap, that they may be familiarised to where
the turnips are grown, after that the trap-door
is unbarred, and the number wanted are taken.
In emptying the cistern, the rabbits are culled,
the fat ones are slaughtered, and the others
turned upon the turnips to improve.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In shooting a rabbit, always consider the
foremost half of him as your target, or he will
probably be shot in a slovenly manner; and if
there is an earth near, most likely scramble
to it, and make his escape.—<i>Moubray</i>—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Racing</span>, <i>v.</i> A contest of speed, in which horses are commonly employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is believed that horse-racing was known
and practised by the Anglo-Saxons, but most
probably confined to persons of rank and opulence,
and followed only for amusement sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first indication, however, of a sport of
this kind occurs in the description of London,
written by Fitzstephen, who lived in the reign
of Henry II. He tells us, that horses were
usually exposed for sale in West Smithfield;
and, in order to prove the excellency of the
most valuable hackneys and charging steeds,
they were matched against each other; his words
are to this effect—“When a race is to be run
by this sort of horses, and perhaps by others,
which also in their kind are strong and fleet, a
shout is immediately raised, and the common
horses are ordered to withdraw out of the way.
Three jockeys, or sometimes only two, as the
match is made, prepare themselves for the contest;
such as being used to ride know how to
manage their horses with judgment: the grand
point is, to prevent a competitor from getting
before them. The horses, on their part, are
not without emulation, they tremble and are
impatient, and are continually in motion: at
last the signal once given, they strike, devour
the course, hurrying along with unremitting
velocity. The jockeys, inspired with the
thoughts of applause and the hopes of victory,
clap spurs to their willing horses, brandish their
whips, and cheer them with their cries.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the middle ages there were certain seasons
of the year when the nobility indulged themselves
in running their horses, and especially in
the Easter and Whitsuntide holidays.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certain, that horse-races were held upon
various holidays, at different parts of the kingdom,
and in preference to other pastimes. “It
had been customary,” says a Chester antiquary,
“time out of mind, upon Shrove Tuesday, for
the company of sadlers belonging to the city of
Chester, to present to the drapers a wooden ball,
embellished with flowers, and placed upon the
point of a lance; this ceremony was performed
in the presence of the mayor, at the cross in
the ‘Rodhee,’ or Roody, an open place near
the city; but this year,” continues he, “the
ball was changed into a bell of silver, valued
at three shillings and sixpence, or more, to be
given to him who shall run the best, and the
farthest on horseback, before them upon the
same day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we see the commencement of a regular
horse-race, but whether the courses were
in immediate succession, or at different intervals,
is not perfectly clear; we find not, however,
the least indication of distance posts,
weighing the riders, loading them with weights,
and many other niceties that are observed in
the present day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Races something similar to those above
mentioned, are described by Butcher, as practised
in the vicinity of the town of Stamford,
in Lincolnshire. “A concourse,” says he, “of
noblemen and gentlemen meet together, in
mirth, peace, and amity, for the exercise of
their swift running-horses, every Thursday in
March. The prize they run for is a silver and
gilt cup, with a cover, to the value of seven or
eight pounds, provided by the care of the alderman
for the time being; but the money is
raised out of the interest of a stock formerly
made up by the nobility and gentry, which are
neighbours and well-wishers to the town.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Running horses are frequently mentioned in
the registers of the royal expenditures. It is
notorious, that king John was so fond of swift
horses and dogs for the chase, that he received
many of his fines in the one or the other; but
at the same time it does not appear that he used
the horses for any purposes of pleasure, beyond
the pursuits of hunting, hawking, and such like
sports of the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the reign of Edward III. the running-horses
purchased for the king’s service, were
generally estimated at twenty marks, or thirteen
pounds six shillings, and eightpence each;
but some few of them were prized as high as
twenty-five marks. An entry appears, dated
the ninth year of this king’s reign, which states,
that the king of Navarre sent him as a present
two running-horses, which I presume were very
valuable, because he gave the person who
brought them no less than one hundred shillings
for his reward.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the reign of James I. public races were
established in many parts of the kingdom; and
it is said that the discipline and modes of preparing
the horses upon such occasions were
much the same as are practised in the present
day. The races were then called bell courses,
because, as we have seen above, the prize was
a silver bell.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the latter end of the reign of Charles I.
races were held in Hyde Park, and at Newmarket.
After the restoration, horse-racing
was revived and much encouraged by Charles
II., who frequently honoured this pastime with
his presence; and, for his own amusement,
when he resided at Windsor, appointed races
to be made in Datchet mead. At Newmarket,
where it is said he entered horses and run
them in his name, he established a house for
his better accommodation; and he also occasionally
visited other places where horse-races
were instituted.</p>

<p class='c006'>About this time it seems, that the bells
were converted into cups, or bowls, or some
other pieces of plate, which were usually valued
at one hundred guineas each; and upon
these trophies of victory the exploits and pedigree
of the successful horses were most
commonly engraved. William III. was also a
patroniser of this pastime, and established an
academy for riding; and his queen not only
continued the bounty of her predecessors, but
added several plates to the former donations.
George I. instead of a piece of plate, gave a
hundred guineas, to be paid in specie.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses take their ages from May-Day;
that is, a horse foaled any time in the year
1828, will be deemed a year old on the 1st of
May, 1829.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four inches are a hand. Fourteen pounds
are a stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Catch weights are, each party to appoint
any person to ride without weighing.</p>

<p class='c006'>A post match, is to insert the age of the
horses in the article, and to run any horse of
that age, without declaring what horse, till he
come to the post to start.</p>

<p class='c006'>A Handicap Match, is A, B, and C, to put
an equal sum each into a hat; C, who is the
handicapper, makes a match for A and B,
who, when they have perused it, put their
hands into their pockets, and draw them out
closed; then they open them together, and if
both have money in their hands, the match is
confirmed; if neither have money, it is no
match. In both cases, the handicapper draws
all the money out of the hat; but if one has
money in his hand, and the other none, then
it is no match; and he that has money in his
hand is entitled to the deposit in the hat.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Free Handicap</i> is an expression which
frequently appears in race lists, the meaning
of which is, that a number of horses being
named, a weight is placed against the name
of each, by the clerk of the races, or some
disinterested person, who is well acquainted
with the performances of the horses. These
weights are supposed to be such as will bring
all the horses as nearly on a par as possible;
and the list containing them being handed to
the owners of each horse, they accept or decline
according as they imagine the chances
are for or against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses not entitled to start without producing
a proper certificate of their age, if required,
at the time appointed in the articles,
except where aged horses are included, and
in that case a junior horse may enter without
a certificate as to age, provided he carry the
same weight as the aged.</p>

<p class='c006'>No person shall start more than one horse
of which he is the owner, either wholly or in
part, and either in his own name or in that of
any other person, for any race for which heats
are run.</p>

<p class='c006'>The horse that has his head at the ending-post
first, wins the heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the best of the plate where three heats
are run, the horse is second that wins one
heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the best of heats, the horse is second
that beats the other horse twice out of three
times, though he does not win a heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where a plate is won by two heats, the
preference of the horses is determined by the
places they get in the second heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where a plate or subscription is given for
the winner of the best of three heats, a horse,
to win the prize, must be the actual winner
of two heats, even though no horse appear
against him for both or either of the heats.</p>

<p class='c006'>When three horses have each won a heat,
they only must start for a fourth, and the
preference amongst them will be determined
by it, there being before no difference amongst
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In running of heats, if it cannot be decided
which horse is first, the heat goes for nothing,
and they may all start again, except it be
between two horses that had each won a
heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a rider fall from his horse, and the horse
be rode in by a person who is sufficient
weight, he shall take his place the same as if
his rider had not fallen, provided he go back
to the place where the rider fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jockeys must ride their horses to the usual
place for weighing the riders, and he that dismounts
before, or wants weight, is distanced;
unless he be disabled by an accident which
should render him incapable of riding back,
in which case he may be led or carried to the
scale.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses’ plates or shoes not allowed in the
weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses running on the wrong side of a post,
and not turning back, are distanced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses drawn before the plate is won are
distanced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses are distanced if their riders cross or
jostle.</p>

<p class='c006'>All complaints of foul riding must be made
before or at the time the jockey is weighed.</p>

<p class='c006'>No distance in a fourth heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>A confirmed bet cannot be off but by mutual
consent, except in the case hereinafter
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>Either of the betters may demand stakes
to be made, and on refusal declare the bet to
be void.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a better be absent on the day of running,
a public declaration of the bet may be made
on the course, and a demand whether any
person will make stakes for the absent party,
and if no person consent to do so, the bet may
be declared void.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bets agreed to be paid or received in London,
or any other specified place, cannot be
declared off on the course.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a match or sweepstakes be made for any
specified day in any race-week, and the parties
agree to change the day to any other in
the same week, all bets must stand; but if
the parties agree to run the race in a different
week, all bets made before the alteration shall
be void.</p>

<p class='c006'>The person who lays the odds has a right

has chosen a horse, the field is what starts

<p class='c006'>Bets and stakes made in guineas are paid
in sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c006'>If odds are laid without mentioning the
horse before the race is over, the bet must be
determined by the state of the odds at the
time of making it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bets made in running are not determined
till the plate is won, if that heat be not mentioned
at the time of running.</p>

<p class='c006'>A bet made after the heat is over, if the
horse betted on does not start, is void.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bets determined, though the horse does
not start, when the words “play or pay,” are
made use of in betting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where two horses run a dead heat for a
sweepstakes or plate, and the parties agree to
divide the stakes equally, all bets between
those two horses, or between either of them,
and the field, must be settled by the money
betted being put together and divided equally
between the parties. If, after the dead heat,
an equal division of the stakes be agreed
upon, then the money betted shall be put together,
and be divided between the parties in
the same proportion as the stakes shall have
been divided. If a bet be made on one of the
horses that run the dead heat against a horse
that was beaten in the race, he who backed
the horse that ran the dead heat wins half
his bet. If the dead heat be the first event
of a double bet, the bet shall be void.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bets made on horses winning any number
of races within the year shall be understood,
however the expression may be varied, as
meaning the year of our Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>Money given to have a bet laid shall not
be returned, though the race be not run.</p>

<p class='c006'>Matches and bets are void on the decease of
either party before the match or bet is determined.</p>

<p class='c006'>A horse walking over or receiving forfeit

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Racehorse</span>, <i>s.</i> A horse bred to run for prizes.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is much dispute with regard to the
origin of the thorough-bred horse. By some
he is traced to both sire and dam to Eastern
parentage; others believe him to be the native
horse, improved and perfected by judicious
crossing with the Barb, the Turk, or the Arabian.
“The Stud Book,” which is an authority
acknowledged by every English breeder,
traces all the old racers to some Eastern origin;
or it traces them until the pedigree is lost
in the uncertainty of an early period of breeding.
If a pedigree of a racer of the present day
be required, it is traced back to a certain extent,
and ends with a well-known racer;—or,
if an earlier derivation be required, that ends
either with an eastern horse, or in obscurity.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must, on the whole, be allowed, that the
present English thorough-bred horse is of foreign
extraction, improved and perfected by the
influence of the climate, and by diligent cultivation.
There are some exceptions, as in the
case of Sampson and Bay-Malton, in each of
whom, although the best horses of their day,
there was a cross of vulgar blood; but they are
only exceptions to a general rule. In our best
racing stables, and, particularly in the studs of
the Earls of Grosvenor and Egremont, this is
an acknowledged principle; and it is not, when
properly considered, a principle at all derogatory
to the credit of the country. The British
climate, and British skill, made the thoroughbred
horse what he is.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever may be the truth as to the origin
of the race-horse, the strictest attention has for
the last fifty years been paid to pedigree. In
the descent of almost every modern racer, not
the slightest flaw can be discovered: or when,
with the splendid exception of Sampson and
Bay-Malton, one drop of common blood has
mingled with the pure stream, it has been immediately
detected in the inferiority of form,
and deficiency of bottom, and it has required
two or three generations to wipe away the stain,
and get rid of its consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>The racer is generally distinguished by his
beautiful Arabian head;—his fine and finely-set-on-neck;—his
oblique, lengthened shoulders;—well-bent
hinder legs;—his ample, muscular
quarters—his flat legs, rather short from
the knee downward, although not always so
deep as they should be;—and his long and
elastic pastern. These are separately considered
where the structure of the horse is
treated of.</p>

<p class='c006'>The racer, however, with the most beautiful
form, is occasionally a sorry animal. There
is sometimes a want of energy in an apparently
faultless shape, for which there is no accounting;
but there are two points among those just
enumerated which will rarely or never deceive,
a well-placed shoulder, and a well-bent
hinder leg.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been imagined that the breed of
racing horses has lately very considerably degenerated.
This is not the case. Thorough-bred
horses were formerly fewer in number, and their
performances created greater wonder. The
breed has now increased twenty-fold, and superiority
is not so easily obtained among so
many competitors. If one circumstance could,
more than any other, produce this degeneracy,
it would be our absurd and cruel habit of bringing
out horses too soon, and the frequent failure
of their legs before they have come to their
full power. Childers and Eclipse did not appear
until they were five years old: but many
of our best horses, and those perhaps, who
would have shown equal excellence with the
most celebrated racers, are foundered and destroyed
before that period.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whether the introduction of short races, and
so young horses, be advantageous, and whether
stoutness and usefulness may not thus be somewhat
too much sacrificed to speed: whether
there may be danger that an animal designed
for service may, in process of time, be frittered
away almost to a shadow of what he was, in
order that at two years old, over the one-mile-course,
he may astonish the crowd by his fleetness,—are
questions that more concern the
sporting man than the agriculturist; and yet
they concern the agriculturist too, for racing is

<p class='c006'><i>Raven or Great Corbie Crow.</i> (<i>Corvus
Corax</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Corbeau</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This is
the largest of this kind; its length is above two
feet; breadth four. Its bill is strong and very
thick at the base; it measures somewhat more
than two inches and a half in length, and is
covered with strong hairs or bristles, which
extend above half its length, covering the nostrils:
the general colour of the upper parts is
a fine glossy black, reflecting a blue tint in particular
lights; the under parts are duller, and
of a dusky hue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The raven is well known in all parts of the
world, and in times of ignorance and superstition,
was considered as ominous, foretelling
future events by its horrid croakings, and announcing
impending calamities: in those times
the raven was considered as a bird of vast importance,
and the various changes and modulations
of its voice were studied with the most
careful attention, and were made use of by
artful and designing men to mislead the ignorant
and credulous. It is a very long-lived
bird, and is supposed sometimes to live a century
or more. It is fond of carrion, which it
scents at a great distance; it is said that it will
destroy rabbits, young ducks, and chickens: it
has been known to seize on young lambs which
have been dropped in a weak state, and pick
out their eyes while yet alive: it will suck the
eggs of other birds; it feeds also on earthworms,
reptiles, and even shell-fish when
urged by hunger.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be rendered very tame and familiar,
and has been frequently taught to pronounce a
variety of words: it is a crafty bird, and will
frequently pick up things of value, such as
rings, money, &amp;c. and carry them to its hiding
place. It makes its nest early in the spring,
and builds in trees and the holes of rocks, laying
five or six eggs, of a pale bluish green colour,
spotted with brown. The female sits
about twenty days, and is constantly attended
by the male, who not only provides her with
abundance of food, but relieves her in turn,
and takes her place in the nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The natives of Greenland eat the flesh, and
make a covering for themselves with the skins
of these birds, which they wear next their bodies.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In 1808, a raven was kept at the Red Lion,
Hungerford: a gentleman’s chaise, in turning
into the yard, ran over the leg of his Newfoundland-dog,
and while examining the injury
done, Ralph was evidently a concerned spectator.
When the dog was tied up, under the
manger with the horses, Ralph attended upon
him with particular kindness: this was so
marked, that it was observed to the hostler,
who said, that he had been bred from his pin-feather
in intimacy with a dog, that the affection
between them was mutual, and that all the
neighbourhood had been witnesses of the acts
of fondness they had conferred upon each other.
This dog also had his leg broke, and during the
long time he was confined Ralph waited upon
him and carried him provisions daily; by accident
the hostler shut the stable door, and Ralph
was deprived of the company of his friend the
whole night, but in the morning the bottom
of the door was found so pecked, that Ralph
would, in another hour, have made his own
entrance port.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Recoil</span>, <i>v.</i> To rush back from resistance; the rebound of a gun.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Recoil.</i>—Whatever retards the exit of the
charge operates like an increase of lead, and,
by confining the force of the explosion the more
to the barrel, produces a greater recoil, hence
partly it is, that in proportion as the barrel becomes
foul within by repeated firing, the recoil
increases. A piece will recoil if, from the
breach plug being made too short, there remain
some turns of the screw not filled up, these
hollows, wherein a part of the powder is lodged,
forming an obstacle that confines and retards
the explosion. A barrel mounted on a stock
that is very straight, will recoil more than when
mounted on a stock that is considerably bent,
as the curvature serves to break and deaden
the force of the recoil; and, sometimes also, a
fowling piece will recoil from the shooter applying
it improperly to his shoulder, for if the
butt is not applied closely to the shoulder, or
is applied so as to be supported only at a single
point, the recoil will be much more sensibly
felt, than when the hollow of the butt embraces
the shoulder, and is firmly supported by
the weight of the body. Guns are observed to
recoil more after being fired a number of times,
than they did at the beginning. The matter
which is left on the inside of the barrel after
the explosion, and which increases on every
discharge, attracts moisture very quickly, especially
if the saltpetre employed in the powder
was not well purified from the admixture
of common salt which it contains in its rough
state. This moisture becomes considerable
after a few discharges, and, being formed into
vapour by the heat during the explosion, adds
its expansive effort to that of the inflamed powder,
and greatly increases the agitation and recoil.
Owing to this cause, probably, rather
than to that before mentioned, arises the recoil,
from some turns of the breech screw not
being filled up by the breech plug, and thereby
affording a lodgment to moisture.—<i>Essay on
Shooting.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rectified Spirit</span>, <i>s.</i> Alcohol, or spirit of wine.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is obtained in a dilute state from fermented
liquors by distillation, and is afterwards
rectified or concentrated, by repeating
the operation two or three times. Rectified
spirit is the basis of many useful embrocations,
for strains, bruises, &amp;c. It dissolves camphor
and all the resins very readily: hence
we have camphorated spirit, opodeldoc, Friar’s
balsam, &amp;c. Mixed with an equal quantity of
water it forms what is termed proof spirit,
which is the liquid generally employed for
making tinctures. Rectified spirit is often
used undiluted as an embrocation for strains;
and, when the injury is deeply seated, may be
serviceable. I think, however, it is rendered
more efficacious by the addition of soap, ammonia
and camphor, or oil of rosemary. Rectified
spirit is never employed as an internal
remedy in the horse; though fermented liquors,
such as beer, porter, or wine, have been
often given with advantage, in cases which
required cordials. Horses, that have been so
fatigued with a long chase or journey as to
refuse their food and appear quite exhausted,
are much refreshed by taking a cordial ball in
half a pint of beer, and feed soon after with
great alacrity. The advantage thus derived is
merely temporary, as they are not by this
treatment rendered adequate to another chase
or journey quicker than they would otherwise
be.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Red</span>, <i>a.</i> Of the colour of blood, of one of the primitive colours.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Redbreast</span>, <i>s.</i> A small bird so named from the colour of its breast, called
also a Robin.</p>

<p class='c006'>This well-known species of warbler needs
little description. The upper parts are of a
yellowish brown, tinged with ash-colour; forehead
and from chin to breast of a deep rufous
orange; belly and vent whitish; the plumage
of both sexes are alike; the nestling-feathers
of young birds are spotted; and they do not
possess the red on the breast for two or three
months after they leave the nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said to be a migrative species, but
from no other reason than their more frequent
and numerous appearance about our habitations
in the winter, when the woods and fields
are destitute of insects; it is then they seek
the protection of man, and are so tame as to
enter doors and windows, and pick up the
crumbs fallen from the table; here they too
frequently fall a sacrifice to the watchful cat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The redbreast,” says Fleming, in a letter
to Colonel Montagu, “is only occasionally
observed in Zetland after gales of wind.”
Whether in spring or autumn, or at what season,
is not mentioned; but most probably in
the latter, when those which breed in the
more northern parts of the European continent
may be shifting their quarters, and, by
accident, are driven from Norway. It sings
throughout the winter, except in severe weather.
About the beginning of April it prepares
a nest in some mossy bank or out-building,
composed of dead leaves, green moss, and
stalks of plants, lined with hair; and lays
from five to seven whitish eggs spotted with
rust-colour and cinereous; their weight about
twenty-six grains.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Redpole</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird of the finch tribe, so called from a red spot on the
crown of the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is less than the common linnet
and twite, and although like them, subject to
a partial change of colour at a particular season,
may be readily distinguished from them,
as well by other peculiar characteristics as by
its inferiority of size, weighing about two
drachms and a half; length five inches; the bill
is of a light colour, inclining to dull yellow;
irides hazel; the forehead is of a purplish red;
the feathers of all the other parts are dusky,
margined with rufous-brown; chin black;
throat and breast pink; sides streaked with
dusky; belly white; quills and tail dusky,
edged with pale brown; in some the rump is
tinged with pink; legs dusky.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female differs in being somewhat lighter
above, and in the colour on the head, which
is not so bright, sometimes yellowish. This
sex has the black spot on the chin, but none
of the pink on the breast and throat. In
confinement they lose the pink colour on the
breast at the first moulting; at the second the
colour on the head changes to a greenish yellow.
Bechstein had a male, the head of
which turned to a fine gold colour after the
third moulting. The young birds are destitute
of the pink feathers; and indeed the
males are subject to as much variety as the
linnet, and sometimes have no red at all on
the breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is very generally diffused
throughout Europe; but its native regions
seem to be the northern parts. They reach
Germany in great flocks towards the end of
October, and again retire in the months of
March and April.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<i>s.</i> A bird.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_430.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This bird weighs about five ounces and a
half: its length is twelve inches, and breadth
twenty-one. The bill, from the tip to the
corners of the mouth, is more than an inch
and three quarters long, black at the point,
and red towards the base: the feathers on the
crown of the head are dark-brown, edged with
pale rufous; a light or whitish line passes
over and encircles each eye, from the corners
of which a dark-brown spot is extended to
the beak: irides hazel; the hinder part of
the neck is obscurely spotted with dark-brown,
on a rusty ash-coloured ground; the throat
and forepart are more distinctly marked or
streaked with spots of the same colour: on
the breast and belly, which are white, tinged
with ash, the spots are thinly distributed,
and are shaped something like the heads of
arrows or darts. The general appearance of
the upper parts of the plumage is glossy olive-brown;
some of the feathers are quite plain,
others spotted on the edges with dark-brown,
and those on the shoulders, scapulars, and
tertials are transversely marked with the same
coloured waved bars, on a pale rusty ground:
the bastard wing and primary quills are dark-brown;
the inner webs of the latter are
deeply edged with white, freckled with brown,
and some of those quills next the secondaries
are elegantly marked, near their tips, with
narrow brown lines, pointed and shaped to the
form of each feather; some of the secondaries
are barred in nearly the same manner,
others are white; back white; the tail-feathers
and coverts are beautifully marked with alternate
bars of dusky and white; the middle
ones slightly tinged with rust colour; legs
red, and measure from the end of the toes to
the upper bare part of the thigh, four inches
and a half.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is of a solitary character, being
mostly seen alone, or in pairs only. It
resides the greater part of the year in the fen
countries, in the wet and marshy grounds,
where it breeds and rears its young. It lays
four eggs, whitish, tinged with olive, and
marked with irregular spots of black, chiefly
on the thicker end. Pennant and Latham say,
it flies round its nest, when disturbed, making
a noise like a lapwing. It is not so common
on the sea-shores as several others of its kindred
species.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ornithologists differ much in their descriptions
of the redshank, and probably have
confounded it with others of the red-legged
tribe, whose proper names are yet wanting, or
involved in doubt and uncertainty. Latham,
in his supplement, describes this bird as differing
so much in its summer and winter
dress, and its weight, as to appear to be of
two distinct species. There is reason to believe
that several species of the scolopax and
tringa genera, which have not been taken into
the list of British birds, appear occasionally in
Great Britain, and that this circumstance, together
with the difference of age and sex, has
occasioned much confusion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red-legged Godwit, Spotted Snipe or
Barker, Spotted Redshank.</i> (<i>Scolopax Totanus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Chevalier Rouge</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The
length of this bird, from the tip of the
bill to the end of the tail is twelve inches,
and to the end of the toes, fourteen inches
and a half; its breadth, twenty-one inches and
a quarter, and its weight about five ounces
two drachms, avoirdupoise. The bill is slender,
measures two inches and a half from the
corners of the mouth to the tip, and is for half
its length, nearest to the base, red, the other
part black: irides hazel; the head, neck,
breast, and belly are spotted in streaks, mottled
and barred with dingy ash-brown and dull
white, darker on the crown and hinder part of
the neck: the throat is white, and lines of
the same colour pass from the upper sides of
the beak over each eye, from the corners of
which two brown ones are extended to the
nostrils: the ground colour of the shoulders,
scapulars, lesser coverts, and tail, is a glossy
olive-brown; the feathers on all these parts
are indented on the edges, more or less, with
triangular-shaped white spots. The back is
white; the rump barred with waved lines of
ash-coloured brown, and dingy white; the
vent-feathers are marked nearly in the same
manner, but with a great portion of white:
the tail and coverts are also barred with narrow
waved lines, of a dull ash-colour, and, in
some specimens, are nearly black and white.
Five of the primary quills are dark-brown,
tinged with olive; the shaft of the first quill
is white; the next six are, in the male, rather
deeply tipped with white, and slightly spotted
and barred with brown: the secondaries, as
far as they are uncovered, when the wings are
extended, are of the same snowy whiteness as
the back. The feathers which cover the upper
part of the thighs, and those near them,
are blushed with a reddish or vinous colour:
the legs are of a deep orange red, and measure,
from the end of the middle toe-nail to
the upper bare part of the thigh, five inches
and a half.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

eyes deep hazel; the plumage in general is
similar to that of the thrush; but a white
streak over the eye distinguishes it from that
bird: the belly is not quite so much spotted,
and the sides of the body, and the feathers
under the wings, are tinged with red, which is
its peculiar characteristic; whence also it derives
its name.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds make their appearance a few
days before the fieldfare, and are generally
seen with them after their arrival; they frequent
the same places, eat the same food, and
are very similar to them in manner. Like
the fieldfare, they leave us in the spring,
for which reason their song is quite unknown
to us; but it is said to be very pleasing. The
female builds her nest in low bushes or
hedges, and lays six eggs, of a greenish blue
colour, spotted with black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This and the former are delicate eating:
the Romans held them in such estimation that
they kept thousands of them together in
aviaries, and fed them with a kind of paste,
made of bruised figs and flour, and various
other kinds of food, to improve the delicacy
and flavour of their flesh; these aviaries were
so contrived as to admit light barely sufficient
to direct them to their food; every object
which might tend to remind them of their
former liberty was carefully kept out of sight,
such as the fields, the woods, the birds, or
whatever might disturb the repose necessary
for their improvement. Under this management
these birds fattened, to the great profit
of their proprietors, who sold them to Roman
epicures for three denarii, or about two shillings
sterling, each.</p>

<p class='c006'>A redwing was taken up, November 7th,
1785, at six o’clock in the morning, which, on
its approach to land, had flown against the
light-house at Tynemouth, and was so stunned
that it fell to the ground and died soon after;
the light most probably had attracted its attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Acute general rheumatism, or rheumatic
fever, is inflammation of the muscular system,
and has been already noticed under the
head founder, or chill. There is, however, a
different kind of rheumatic affection I have
sometimes met with, in which the joints are
affected; generally, I believe, the hock joint;
but probably the other joints are equally
liable to this affection. It is sometimes accompanied
with a morbidly irritable state of
the stomach and bowels, and if a strong or
even a common purgative is given in such a
case, there will be danger of its producing inflammation
of these parts. The same irritable
state of the stomach and bowels is sometimes
observable also in chills, as they are
termed, and when the hind-leg is suddenly
attacked with inflammation and swelling, after
violent shivering and fever. In all such cases,
though physic is often necessary, that is, when
the bowels are in a costive state, yet it is likely
to do great harm unless in a moderate dose,
and guarded with cordials or opium. The
following ball may be given on such occasions:
it must be observed, however, that copious
bleeding is the essential remedy, and must
precede every other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rickets is very like to tabies, in all its
causes, and also in some of its appearances
and effects; it is common to the same breeds,
and is both occasional and hereditary. It is
occasional when it meets with the circumstances
of confinement, bad air, filth, and
unwholesome food, or the milk of an unhealthy
mother. Many whelps are born with
the predisposition, among the fancy breeds in
the confined parts of great cities and large
towns, particularly pugs and the smaller sorts
of bull dogs: there is also a breed of wry-legged
terriers which without doubt originated
in ricketty specimens, which were afterwards
cultivated for particular purposes, principally
rabbit-hunting. The affection often appears
soon after birth; and shows itself by the slow
development of the body, except in the head,
belly, and joints, all of which enlarge at the
expense of the rest of the parts: particularly
it attacks all the joints of the extremities;
these swell into protuberances, probably from
a sympathy in the constitution to make up
by bulk what the bones want in ponderosity,
but which is not effected; for, deprived of
their earthy solidifying principles, they yield
to the superincumbent weight, and the cylindrical
ones particularly become crooked.
Cleanliness, good air, free exercise, and wholesome
food, will commonly prevent it in the
future breeds of such dogs as have shown a
disposition to it. As a cure, an invigorating
diet added to these, with the occasional use of
tonic bitters if the appetite fails, or the digestion
should appear defective, will answer the
intention.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>In Riding.</i>—Jockeys may be divided into several
classes: namely, the southern jockeys, the
northern jockeys, and the dirty jockeys. The
first class are those which are seen at Newmarket,
Ascot, Epsom, and indeed in most of the races
in the southern counties, and also at Doncaster.
The second class attend the Yorkshire
meetings, and what, for the sake of distinction,
I will call the northern circuit. The third or
dirty class, are met with still farther to the
north, in Westmoreland, Cumberland, &amp;c. and
are remarkable for their slovenly, dirty, and
unworkmanlike appearance:—it is no uncommon
occurrence to see these wretched apologies
for jockeys (at Kendal for instance) ride
in dirty jackets, dark greasy corduroys, and
gaiters of a similar complexion. Mr. Thomas
Simpson’s jockey frequently appears thus,
though Mr. Simpson is wealthy and highly respectable;
but evidently not very scrupulous on
the score of cleanliness. The southern jockeys,
much to their credit, appear on horseback with
a neatness and cleanliness bordering upon elegance;
and their performance is, for the most
part, of a superior order—superior, in fact, to
their rivals of the north; they are illiterate ignorant
men, with little exception: though, in
private, they affect a mysterious, but plebeian
importance, and would willingly be thought a
sort of semi-gentlemen, which, however, their
very attempt to assume such a character renders
impossible. There is much less of this
ridiculous and ignorant affectation in the northern
jockeys, who yet seem, it must be confessed,
not nearly so anxious about their appearance
on horseback (as far as relates to the
advantage of dress,) as their brethren of the
south.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question next arises as to which are the
best workmen. The southerns, beyond a doubt;
that is, speaking generally: but, it must be admitted,
that there are some excellent northern
jockeys, who would lose little by the comparison
with either Chifney, Robinson, Dockeray,
or any of the most favourite riders of the present
day. Buckle is now grown old, and does
not often appear; otherwise, I should place him
at the head of the list. H. Edwards must be
classed, I imagine, amongst the northern jockeys;
he has a good seat, good hands, and a good
head; and is altogether an excellent rider: I
am doubtful if his superior is to be found. T.
Shepherd, a northern jockey, has a good head,
and I have always admired his riding; I think
his abilities have generally been much underrated.
Lear is a promising young northern
jockey; but he must be careful not to let his
self-opinion and overbearing temper supersede
the plain uncultivated sense he possesses. Templeman
is what may be called an improving
jockey: he has a good seat, and I have frequently
been much pleased with his performances.
He rode Dr. Faustus (Sir T. Stanley’s)
remarkably well at the Liverpool summer
meeting, and I thought won the cup—I was
not singular in this opinion: the judge, however,
decided in favour of Velocipede. I never
recollect observing a horse better managed than
Forth managed his own horse Frederick, when
running this year (1829) at Epsom, for the
Derby. He had betted to a considerable
amount upon Exquisite (also his own horse,
and came in second) particularly with Mr.
Crockford; but shifted his money the evening
before running on Frederick, and thus became
a winner to a very considerable amount. There
are many very awkward jockeys, possessing but
very slender requisites for the profession which
they have embraced; to point them out, however,
by name, would appear ill-natured and
invidious.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is some dozen years or more since “old
Billy Pierse” quitted the avocation of a jockey.
This man I always considered as a very superior
rider—as one of the best I ever saw. In
stature he was one of the shortest of his fraternity:
but he was a sort of dwarf Hercules:
he was able to give his horse a pull without
any perceptible movement of his body; and of
all the jockeys I ever saw, not one sat so steadily
upon his horse. He never acquired the
fame of Chifney; though there are those who
think his merits were equal, if not superior to
that celebrated jockey:—such is the opinion of
one gentleman, in particular, whose superior
judgment I have frequently experienced and
very much admired.</p>

<p class='c006'>What I have denominated the “dirty
jockeys,” are little worthy of consideration.
They are very indifferent riders, but made up
of trick and cunning; and ready at any time
to put in practice their sinister arts for the purposes
of deception, swindling and fraud.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I have not the least doubt, were this description
of jockeyship entirely superseded, it
would give very general satisfaction to the true
friends of the turf. In the first place, with the
exception of Lord Wilton, Mr. White, and
some others, there are few gentlemen but what
make a poor, or perhaps ridiculous, figure in
riding a race. When gentlemen are to ride, it
seldom happens that the patience of the multitude
is not put to the test: if the preparations
for gentlemen riders are not more complex
than those of the professed jockeys, they
cannot be either so well defined, or so direct,
since they occupy a period of time of at least
six times the duration. But this is by no means
the worst of the business:—the system is liable
to very gross abuse; and a class of men contrive
to insinuate themselves into it, who have
very meagre pretensions indeed to the character
of gentlemen, and whose operations are, for
the most part, merely a cloak for the basest
purposes. I have often been surprised, that
those genuine or sterling gentlemen who choose
to contend in the race, are not more scrupulous
as to the persons in whose company they thus
appear: accustomed as they are to the turf,
they cannot be unconscious, surely, that men
frequently are seen as gentlemen riders, who
are not only destitute of every honourable feeling,
but whose exertions are in furtherance of
a system of swindling, base and degrading, and
utterly incompatible with the best interests of
the turf. Also, a number of these men cannot
come fairly under the description of amateur
riders, since they go from race to race throughout
the season, and are in the constant habit of
riding, which they understand as well as the
regular jockeys. What chance has a mere
amateur against such competitors?</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>As to jockeys riding to order, nothing can
be more correct or judicious, when such orders
are intended to bring out the horse, so
as to make the most of his powers, and to
win if possible; but many cases have no doubt
occurred of an opposite description, where the
horse possessing the qualities to win, has been
ridden purposely to lose. Yet, I am inclined
to think, that suspicion has not unfrequently
been expressed without just grounds. It
should be recollected that horses vary considerably
in their running, unaccountably so
at times, either from latent disease, or other
inexplicable cause; and therefore before a
jockey is accused of wilfully riding to lose,
the matter should be very dispassionately
considered. Generally speaking, a jockey is
very anxious to win, and I should be more
inclined to suspect him of foul riding in order
to win, than premeditatedly riding to lose,
unless he had betted largely against the horse,
and this is much more likely to occur where
the jockey happens to be the owner of the
horse, than under ordinary circumstances.—<i>Turf

<p class='c006'>I have made many experiments, and thought
a good deal, by way of ascertaining the best
calibre for answering the particular or general
purposes to which the rifle may be applied.
We all know that the resistance of the air is
the chief obstacle which projected bodies have
to encounter. It is so very great, that the
range of projected spheres is more regulated by
the degree of this resistance than by the velocity
they receive from the powder,—the increased
velocity of the ball being met by a
geometrically increased ratio of atmospheric resistance.
The larger bullets, therefore, having
less surface in proportion to their mass, are,
proportionately, much less resisted; so that
the flights of the larger exceed those of the
lesser, in more than the proportion of their respective
diameters. For instance, a thirty-two
pound shot, whose diameter is about six inches,
will, with even a less proportionate charge of
powder, and at an equal elevation, range half
as far again as a nine pound, whose diameter
is four inches. The proportion which the
surface of a sphere bears to its mass, increasing
in a geometrical ratio to the decrease of
its diameter—the smaller the sphere, the
greater is the proportionate resistance it meets
with in its flight. At length, we find that small
particles of the heaviest metals, becoming, as it
were, nearly all surface, will actually float in
the atmosphere, or remain suspended for a
considerable time in the lightest fluids. Hence
it is, that from the same piece, and with a similar
charge of powder, we shall find that the
range of an ounce of bird shot will regularly
extend with the increased size of the shot employed,
until, in progression, we get to the
ounce bullet itself, which fits the piece; and
which, by the by, at an elevation, would not
be impelled further if projected from a twenty-four
pound cannon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The theory of the air’s regular resistance to
the onward progress of the bullet, must also be
applied to the irregular action of the wind
across the line of its flight; which action also
increases in the ratio of the decrease of the
weight of the bullet. At the distance of 315
yards I have found a strong cross wind to
cause a rifle bullet of nineteen to the pound
to diverge from three to four feet. On the
other hand, I have used a rifle carrying a bullet
of ten to the pound, which, with the same
wind, did not, at the same distance, diverge
more than about one foot. In constructing a
butt for rifle practice, regard should, therefore,
be had to the more usual direction of the
wind; and, as far as the locality will allow, the
butt should be placed so as to have the wind
more frequently in the line of the range, either
way, than across it.</p>

<p class='c006'>For general, and especially for military
purposes, such large rifles as the last mentioned
would, coupled with the ammunition,
be found too heavy. The rifles commonly
used in the United States carry, I am told, a
bullet of thirty-two to the pound. The adoption
of so small a calibre, I take to have been
occasioned by the use of the rifle being, in that
country, originally and generally confined to
the interior of thick forests, wherein it seldom
happens that an object is to be fired at beyond
the distance of one hundred yards; and where,
moreover, the wind is much less felt than in
an open country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the above circumstances, the half-ounce
rifles are quite adequate to their purpose;
but in a more open, and especially in a
mountainous country, the calibre of rifles
should be considerably larger. In a hilly
country, you are often in the actual presence
of the enemy, and capable of greatly annoying
him, at distances at which, on a plain,
the view is interrupted and confined by the
least considerable of surrounding objects. In
a hilly country, occasions are perpetually offering,
wherein long rifle ranges would cause
considerable mischief to your opponents.
Such long ranges can never be obtained, nor
depended on, with the half-ounce rifles of the
Americans and Tyrolese.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the foregoing observations are founded on
fact, it is easy to decide what sort of rifle
should be applied to a particular purpose.
With respect to general purposes, I am inclined
to fix on the calibre of one ounce, or
sixteen bullets to the pound. The English
government rifles are of nineteen or twenty
to the pound; to which calibre there is little
objection, especially as it is the same as that
of the cavalry carbines and pistols. However,
I could advance several reasons,—I do not
call them very important ones,—for preferring
the French regulation; according to which
all the fire-arms of all the different corps,
both of cavalry and infantry, are of one and
the same calibre, of sixteen bullets to the
pound.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the rifle, at least, I would
most strenuously recommend the substitution
of percussion for flint locks; over which the
advantages of the former are as great as the
latter are superior to the huge wheel and pyrites
locks of two centuries ago. In comparison
to the percussion gun, the very best flint
one absolutely hangs fire, and one out of
twenty is usually a miss-fire. A cap is put
on much quicker than a flint lock is primed;
there is no time lost in changing flints; and
if Mr. Joyce’s percussion powder be used,
there is no foulness or corrosion whatever;
lastly, the rifles at present in use might be
converted into copper caps at a trifling expense,
and new copper cap locks will cost less than
flint ones. The only objection to the change
(and I own it is a very great one indeed), is
the blind prejudice of custom.</p>

<p class='c006'>To render the use of the copper cap piece
still more eligible, especially for military purposes,
there should be no lateral vent-hole in
the breech, but in lieu of it, a broad convex-headed
screw; which, upon being withdrawn,
opens a passage into the chamber under the
nipple, of an eighth of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this simply contrivance,—which I have
applied to all my own guns, rifles, and pistols,—should
any obstruction occur, either
from wet or dirt, which cannot be removed
by merely probing the nipple, it will infallibly
he cleared out by removing the screw, scooping
out the passage into the chamber, putting
a little powder therein, and firing it off, after
having probed the nipple and replaced the
screw. The aperture formed by the removal
of the screw, greatly adds to the facility
of washing the barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instead of the brush and brass wire pricker,
required for the present flint-lock service, the
use of percussion pieces would make it necessary
to substitute a little instrument of steel,
resembling the letter T; one half of the horizontal
part being a four, or, what is perhaps
better, a three-sided pricker, or probe, of
about one-twentieth of an inch diameter.
The other half of the horizontal piece forms a
kind of little scoop, corresponding to the
diameter of the lateral screw above mentioned;
upon the removal of which it is to be
employed. The centre piece, or foot of the
T, is a turnscrew, surmounted by a little ring
to attach it to the jacket. As, however, the
instrument will not be often wanted, perhaps
it had better be kept in the trap of the rifle
stock, in the inside of which I attach it, by a
thong, to a little screw staple.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some persons recommend that, instead of
the lateral screw above described, the nipple
itself should be taken out, in case of obstruction,
or for the purpose of washing the barrel.
This is not only ineffective, but highly improper,
as it requires the use of a particular
shaped key or pincer to screw the nipple;
whereas, such things as will turn a screw, or
serve the purpose of a pricker, are to be found
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c006'>The percussion powder for the caps, should
by all means be composed of the nitrate of
mercury, first brought into use by Mr. F.
Joyce, of Old Compton Street. This, instead
of having the slightest tendency to corrode
the piece, would rather appear to possess an
anti-oxidating property; for I have repeatedly
found that, having fired upwards of twenty
rounds with this percussion powder, and laid
the piece by for a month without the least
cleansing, it has been, at the expiration of
that time, as perfectly free from the least
speck of rust as the day it came new from the
maker’s shop. This would certainly not be
the case even with a common flint lock; but
as for the common percussion powder, composed
of superoxygenated muriate of potash,
it actually corrodes the parts of a gun as
much as a drop of nitric acid itself; in fact,
upon combustion it evolves, and leaves a residuum
of that active fluid upon the iron. The
consequent rapid destruction of the parts is
such as would, especially in military service,
occasion great inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have often compared notes, and reflected
upon the respective advantages belonging to
the magazine and copper cap locks, either for
military or sporting purposes. Of magazine
locks hitherto invented, the best and simplest
is that by Forsyth, with the magazine sliding
upon a plane, in which is the touch-hole,
being connected with the cock by a bridle,
which causes it to follow or precede its motions.
For military use, this lock has the
advantage over the copper cap, inasmuch as it
saves the time and attention required for
priming; nothing else being required than to
cock and pull the trigger. In rifle practice,
the use of this lock will more than retrieve
the small additional portion of time which it
requires to push down even my rifle cartridge,
above what it takes to drop a cartridge into a
common musket, with all its windage. On
horseback, the advantages of such magazine
locks are still more evident and important;
as every one knows what an awkward loss of
time and powder the operation of priming a
flint lock occasions to a horseman in motion;
whereas, with the magazine, containing thirty
or forty primings, and a swivel ramrod, a carbine
or pistol may be loaded with the same
speed and precision on horseback, at a trot
or a gallop, as when sitting in a chair. It
is certainly easier to put on a copper cap than
to prime a flint lock; but, with the magazine,
there is no priming operation at all. With
the common corrosive percussion powder
above spoken of, the magazine lock certainly
becomes very unfit for military purposes; for
after having fired a shot or two, without subsequent
cleaning, the lock will be nearly immovable
the day after. However, in the
late Spanish campaign of 1823, I had several
magazine rifles and pistols, and no other than the
corrosive percussion powder; but the officers
and men to whom I entrusted them were so
proud and so careful of them, as to keep them
always in the most perfect order. Anyhow,
it is evident that, for cavalry officers at least,
the percussion magazine locks are undoubtedly,
to be preferred; and, for both officers and
men, I will observe, <i>en passant</i>, that it is
far better to have one double pistol, than two,
or half a dozen, single ones; and that whether
one or two pistols be used, they should,
upon going into action, he secured by a thong
to the sword-belt; so as, in case of need, to
be instantly disposed of by being dropped
over the left shoulder. By having only one
pistol, one holster may be converted into a
convenient pouch. It is essential that, in
double pistols, carbines, or rifles, the axis of
the barrels should be perfectly parallel from
breech to muzzle. If this be strictly attended
to, it is not of much consequence whether they
be disposed as in a fowling-piece, or, as it is
called, “under and over.” One “under and
over” pistol, eight inch barrels (the upper one
rifled), nineteen bore, swivel ramrod, with a
movable spring butt, to be kept in the other
holster when not in use, is an excellent weapon
for an officer. The movable butt must
also serve the purpose of a mallet in loading
the rifled barrel. Three or four slight taps
will send the ball home: for, particularly on
horseback, a rifle-barrelled pistol cannot well
be loaded by pushing with so small a ramrod.
With the smooth barrel, the party may fire
away, either with ball or buck-shot cartridges,
as fast as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The copper cap offers the advantage of
somewhat greater simplicity, and consequently
less liability to derangement; and above all,
it is, with the application of wax as hereafter
described, perfectly water-proof. For the rifle
service, therefore, it might perhaps, in one
point of view, be preferable to the magazine;
and certainly it is so in every respect for
fowling pieces; in the use of which protection
from the rain is of much more importance
than the gain of a few seconds in loading, and
where none of the inconveniences of priming
on horseback are experienced. Duelling pistols
should decidedly be copper caps. With
such pistols there is no occasion whatever for
a magazine; and I have found that a delicate
trigger cannot be subjected to the slightest
casual pull or strain of the magazine stirrup,
without great liability to accident.</p>

<p class='c006'>A remarkable defect in all the rifle-shooting
that I have ever seen, is the improper construction
of the ramrod, which is much too
light. From this it results, that either the
bullet is inserted with too little constriction
to ensure its revolving on its axis to the end
of an extensive flight; or, upon a tighter fit
being attempted, much time and awkward
exertion are expended in driving it properly
“home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The friction to be overcome in forcing a
bullet into a rifle is, in some respects, analogous
to that of a wedge or a nail in entering a
piece of wood. Nobody would think of driving
a nail or a wedge by mere pressure or
pushing, which would not effect the object
with a thousand times the force that would
suffice in the shape of percussion or impingement.
To load a rifle with a mallet is out
of the question, especially for military purposes;
but I find that the very best effect is
produced by having the ramrod of solid brass,
considerably heavier than the iron ones of
the government rifles. I have also a bit of
hard wood, turned into the shape of a pestle,
acutely convex at the thick end; and to qualify
it for hasty use, I fasten it by a string to
the button of my jacket. With this I give
the ball a smart tap, which drives it below
the centre of its circumference into the
grooves of the barrel. If the latter be perfectly
clean, the bullet will go down all the
way by mere pushing; but this will not be
the case after a few shots have been fired,
unless the bullet be smaller than it should
be. Any how, the ramrod ought always to
be flung down once or twice, in conclusion—as
the particular ring or jar, so produced, furnishes
the only true criterion of the bullet
being really “home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The ramrod being of the proper weight, and
the end applied to the bullet being nearly
equal to its calibre and well countersunk, the
bullet will be moved by it with a few easy percussions;
and should the barrel be ever so foul
towards the breech, one or two flings with such
a ramrod will send the bullet “home” with the
assured ring. Neither a wooden nor a light metal
ramrod will produce this effect after a few shots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ramrods I have had constructed for
my own use are of solid brass, of about half
an inch diameter except the end applied to
the bullet, which, for a couple of inches, is so
large as just to fit easily into the barrel. This
large end is bored conically out, so as to contain
between two and three drachms of powder,
which, in leisure shooting, serves to introduce
the charge with the rifle reversed. The
ball-drawer, when required, screws into the
other end of the rod.</p>

<p class='c006'>The government rifle ramrods, might, for
economy’s sake, be made of iron; but they
should be much heavier than they are. It is
absolutely necessary to good and quick rifle
shooting, that the bullet should be driven into
the mouth of the piece by a stroke of some
sort or other, previously to the use of the ramrod.
Should the little wooden pestle mentioned
above be deemed inconvenient in military
practice,—which I opine it is not,—a similar
effect might be produced by a tap with
the round button-like end of the present rifle
ramrods; though, for the sake of the barrel,
I would recommend that this button should
be of soft copper. Were it made more convex,
it would drive the bullet further in.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident, that for actual service, the
practice cannot be rendered too simple. So I
only just mention, <i>en passant</i>, that in my
own cartridge pouch, twelve cartridges, to be
used first, are made with thicker cotton, which,
for distinction’s sake, is red or blue. So, as
the barrel becomes foul, I get to the other
cartridges, of somewhat easier introduction.
I have found it very pleasant even to divide
my cartridges into three different fits—red,
blue, and white. A rifle, however, deteriorates
in accuracy of shooting, in proportion to the
number of shots fired without cleaning the
barrel. For the foulness accumulating mostly
towards the breech, forms there a certain degree
of constriction and obliteration of the
grooves, into which part the bullet being
forced, no longer fits the other and greater
portion of the barrel, so to ensure its spinning
upon its axis to the end of a long range. After
twenty-five shots, without cleaning, at 315
yards, in very dry weather, I have found the
bullets begin to deviate a little; as they no
longer struck the target on the side which had
come foremost from the barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the rifleman’s cartridge-pouch,
it should certainly be placed in front,
buckling round the waist with a broad strap.
The great thickness or projection which is
given to the English rifle-pouches has many
inconveniences; one of which is, that the
weight, being concentrated into one almost
cubic mass, causes great fatigue and annoyance,
and perhaps injury, to the bearer. So
far from having any such shape, I have found
that the pouch ought to be so flat, as only to
contain one row of tin tubes for cartridges,
twenty-four of which occupy a space of about
fourteen inches from hip to hip. The tubes being
about five inches long, open at each end, but
divided in the middle by a diaphragm, contain
two cartridges each. When the uppermost
row is consumed, to get at the others, it is
only required to draw out the tubes, and reverse
them in the pouch. If the cartridges
are closed up, according to the method recommended
in another part of this Treatise, they
may, from the increased diameter of the
folded end, be made to stick more or less
firmly in the reversed half of the tubes,
when these are drawn out to be turned. The
pouch covers up with a flap of flexible leather,
saturated with linseed oil, and secured at pleasure
with a round button and loop. At one
or both ends of the pouch is a little leathern
bag, which may contain one or more packets
of spare cartridges. I prefer, however, the
method I have observed amongst the Calabrians
and Corsicans, who, had they rifles,
would be the most formidable skirmishers in
the world. Their pouches go all round the
body; though sometimes it is, as it were, a
double pouch, with only small intervals at
each hip, occupied by a bayonet on one side,
and a middling-sized pistol on the other. From
having only one row of tubes, these pouches
are so little protuberant, as to be scarcely
more perceptible, under or over the jacket,
than a simple belt would be. When the cartridges
are exhausted in front, the pouch is
easily slipped round as much as required.
Moreover, the weight being so distributed all
round the body, gives scarcely any incumbrance;
and I have found it a further improvement
to partially support it by braces,
worn under the jacket or waistcoat. Slips
from the usual trouser suspenders will answer
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must yet add a few words, by way of recommending
some essential alterations in the
method of exercising the troops to the use of
that weapon, which will in most respects apply
to the musket, carbine, and pistol.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all the rifle or musket practice that I
have ever seen or heard of, the men are made
to fire at a target of about three feet diameter,
placed before a bank or mound of earth,
which receives all the missing bullets. Nothing
can be more ineffectual in the way of
instruction than this method! Every shot
which misses the target, might as well have
been fired vertically in the air, for any instruction
it can have afforded to the firer!
Even those bullets which do strike the target,
will furnish no precise criteria of experience,
unless the actual mark of each be immediately
pointed out to the man who fired it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The butt, or rather wall, for teaching rifle
or musket shooting, should be at least twelve
feet square, or rather twelve feet broad and
twenty high. It should be covered entirely
with cast-iron plates, of about three quarters of
an inch thick. A convenient movable butt may
be composed of a rectangular frame of wood,
traversed like a window-frame, by pieces of
wood at right angles or diagonally, having holes
at the intersections for the admission of flat-headed
bolts, by which the four corners of
the cast-iron plates, corresponding to the size
of the square divisions, will be secured to the
frame, in close connexion with each other.
Such a butt being set up endways, need only
be connected, by a pulley at the top, to a
couple of poles fixed in the earth, or to the
top of a movable triangle. Any inclination,
either forwards or backwards, may be given to
it by means of the pulley. If it be inclined
backwards at an angle of eighty to eighty-five
degrees, the bullets, at medium and short
ranges, will be reflected upwards nearly perpendicularly
in the air.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ground in front of the butt should be
well levelled to the distance of about thirty
yards, and covered with sifted road-scrapings,
in preference to turf, gravel, or sand.</p>

<p class='c006'>As unnecessary waste should in all cases
be avoided, there is no reason why the recovery
of the bullets should not be attended to.
The best way to insure this, is to give the
surface of the butt an inclination forward, of
about ten degrees upon the horizontal line,
which will cause the bullets to be reflected
downwards upon the smooth ground in front.
The recovered lead might be given as the perquisite
of the marker, or to the best shot at
the drill.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little on one side, and about five yards
in advance of the butt, there should be a little
screen, or epaulement, behind which a man
might safely stand to perform the office of
marker. This marker must be provided with
a pot of lamp-black and water, with a brush
affixed to a long stick, and a pot of whitewash.
He must also have a bit of chalk, or a box of
various coloured wafers, to mark the shots.
To prepare the butt for shooting, it must be
blackened all over. An object is then to be
designated in the middle, either with whitewash,
or with one or more sheets of white
paper, according to the distance, and to the
proficiency of the men who are to practise.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instead of a circular object or target, I recommend,
for military practice, a perpendicular
parallelogram of two, four, six, twelve,
or more inches broad, and one, two, three, or
five feet high. If such a figure be made with
whiting on the black butt, the bullets will
make very distinct marks upon it, while those
which miss it will leave white ones on the
butt. If paper be used, care must be taken
that it be not moved about by the wind.
Pieces of thick wrought iron, of the shape
and dimensions last described, to suit the different
distances, &amp;c., whitened and hung up
against the butt, form excellent targets, especially
for distant shooting. A loud gong-like
clang announces the stroke of a bullet, while
the marker may pretty well indicate, with a
stick blackened at the end, its precise situation.
He will also point out the site of those
unresponsive shots which do not hit the mark.
The presiding officer should use a telescope.
This method will obviate the necessity of perpetually
walking up to the target, which occasions
much loss of time, confusion, and danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I have always observed that it gives
most satisfaction to the firer, when he sees the
object fired at actually knocked down from
its situation, this result might easily be obtained
either with plates of plaster of Paris,
or with metal ones. It may be also well to
observe, that a bright red is undoubtedly the
colour which can be seen at the greatest distance,
and consequently the properest for a
<i>bull’s-eye</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every shot being marked, and pointed out
to the man who fired it, he will always be able
to form a criterion by which to regulate his
next attempt. Men might as well be made
to shoot at a bottle in the dark, as to practise
without knowing where the bullet strikes—except
when they may chance to hit the
bull’s-eye! I will venture to assert, that five
shots fired with care, comparison, and reflection,
will produce more improvement than
fifty expended in the usual irrational manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is particularly requisite to attend to the
<i>perpendicular</i> line; and that no shot be
allowed to count, which strikes the butt at
more than five feet from the ground. In
service, it is far better that the bullet should
fall rather short, than that it should go over
the adversary’s head; as, in the former case,
if it be on tolerably level ground, and in the
right perpendicular direction, there is a great
probability of its hitting him by the ricochet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both in rifle and pistol-shooting, an absurd
custom prevails, of pointing the piece upwards,
and bringing it down to a level with the object
to be fired at. Instead of this practice, to
which there are many objections, the piece
should, previously to being cocked, be pointed
downwards, at less than a yard from the foot
of the firer. It is then to be steadily raised
up in the line of the object, and when within
a certain distance from the proposed level,
the trigger (if not a detent) should be gradually
pressed, according to the knowledge which
the firer has of it, so that it may just go off
without any pull at the desired moment.
While the piece is in motion upwards, the
perpendicular line described will be true and
steady; and the quicker the motion the truer
the line. When the perpendicular motion
ceases, the horizontal vacillation begins. The
aim, therefore, should not be prolonged beyond
the arrival of the sight at the intended
level; but whenever it is so, the piece must
be lowered below it, and brought up again.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I have invented, says the Colonel, a simple
method of rendering copper caps perfectly
water proof. It consists in dipping the open
rim, or base of the cap, into green taper
wax, melted in a plate over a lamp. The
melted wax must not be so deep as to spread
into the cap up to the percussion powder at its
extremity, but only so high as to form a slight
lining of the wax around its inner base. This
will suffice to cause the cap to close hermetically
over the nipple; so that, provided it be
not cracked, and the gun have no lateral vent-hole
(which it ought not to have), the loaded
piece may be put, over the lock, into a pail of
water, without affecting either the cap or the
charge. For sporting purposes, it is sufficient
to have a few such caps in store, for wet weather.
For military use, the whole of the caps
might be so prepared at the laboratories.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two rifle guns of the manufactory, the one
valued at a hundred, the other at twenty-five
guineas, were next loaded, and fired by General
Beaumont and another person against my
rifle, called Caroline, the distance agreed on
being one hundred yards. General Beaumont’s
first shot hit the bull’s eye, upon which he
was highly complimented; mine in return was
an inch from it, and high odds were consequently
in favour of the General. The succeeding
shots were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>General Beaumont’s second shot missed,
and went over the iron plate three feet square.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Thornton’s ditto near the bull’s
eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>General B’s third shot below the iron, and
struck the ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel T’s ditto hit the bull’s eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>General B’s fourth shot struck to the left
of the plate thirteen inches from the mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel T’s ditto near the mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>General B’s fifth shot went over the mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel T’s ditto within one inch of the
bull’s eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other rifle, shot by a person belonging
to the manufactory, did not succeed better
than General Beaumont, and the decision was
consequently given in my favour. The rifle
I shot with on this occasion, was the workmanship
of Mr. Sluden, of Cockspur Street.</p>

square, between his knees, while his comrade

<p class='c006'>The ring dove is very generally diffused
throughout Europe; it is said to be migratory;
but that it does not leave us entirely we are
well convinced, as we have frequently seen
them during the winter on the banks of the
Tyne, where they constantly breed in the
spring. The nest is composed of small twigs,
so loosely put together, that the eggs may be
seen through it from below.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female lays two white eggs, and is generally
supposed to have two broods in the
year. They feed on wild fruits, herbs, and
grain of all kinds; they likewise are very fond
of the roots of the pernicious weeds so well
known to farmers under the name of <i>whickens</i>;
the <i>Triticum repens</i>, or couch-grass,
is the principal one; their flesh is very
delicious when they have fed upon these, but
it soon acquires an unpleasant flavour when
they have lived upon turnips, which, from necessity,
they are driven to eat in severe winters.
The ring dove has a louder and more
plaintive sort of cooing than the common
pigeon, but is not heard except in pairing

<p class='c006'>The ring dove or wood pigeon is the largest

<p class='c006'>The major part of them, in respect to this
kingdom, are emigrants, departing elsewhere
at the latter end of the year, and returning
early in the spring. In the beginning of winter
they assemble in large flocks, and leave off
their plaintive cooing, which they commence in
March, when they pair; they chiefly inhabit
the woods, and build in the tops of trees,
making a large, loose, and flat nest, with dry
sticks and bents; they breed twice in the year,
first in April; the second brood appears most
numerously in August; they seldom lay more
than two eggs, larger but alike in colour to
other pigeons, and sit fourteen days before the
young are hatched. Wood pigeons are excellent
eating, except when they feed on turnips
and rape. They are useful in coverts that
are made preserves for pheasants, by immediately
taking alarm if any person enters them
after they have roosted, and quitting the trees
upon which they had settled for the night,
they fly about in great commotion. The
gamekeepers know how to profit by this sort
of intelligence in their search after intruders.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This bird very much resembles the blackbird;
its general colour is of a dull black or
dusky hue; each feather is margined with a
greyish ash colour; the bill is dusky; corners
of the mouth and inside yellow; eyes
hazel; its breast is distinguished by a crescent
of pure white, which almost surrounds the
neck, and from which it derives its name; its
legs are of a dusky brown. The female differs
in having the crescent on the breast much
less conspicuous, and in some birds wholly
wanting, which has occasioned some authors
to consider it as a different species under the
name of the rock ouzel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ring ousels are found in various parts of
this kingdom, chiefly in the wilder and more
mountainous districts of the country. Their
habits are similar to those of the blackbird;
the female builds her nest in the same manner,
and in similar situations, and lays four or
five eggs of the same colour; they feed on insects
and berries of various kinds, are fond of
grapes, and Buffon observes during the season
of vintage are generally fat, and at that time
are esteemed delicious eating. The same
author says that in France they are migratory.
In some parts of this kingdom they have been

<p class='c006'>On the 13th of April, I went to the sheep-down,
where the ring-ousels have been observed
to make their appearance at spring and
fall, in their way perhaps to the north or south;
and was much pleased to see three birds about
the usual spot. We shot a cock and a hen;
they were plump and in high condition. The
hen had but very small rudiments of eggs
within her, which proves they are late breeders;
whereas those species of the thrush kind
that remain with us the whole year, have
fledged young before that time. In their
crops was nothing very distinguishable, but
somewhat that seemed like blades of vegetables
nearly digested. In autumn they feed on
haws and yew-berries, and in the spring on
ivy-berries. I dressed one of these birds, and
found it juicy and well-flavoured. It is remarkable
that they make but a few days’ stay
in their spring visit, but rest near a fortnight
at Michaelmas. These birds, from the
observations of three springs and two autumns,
are most punctual in their return; and exhibit
a new migration unnoticed by the writers,
who supposed they never were to be seen in
any of the southern counties.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>White’s

<p class='c006'><i>Shooting Wildfowl on a River, &amp;c.</i>—For
killing common wild ducks that frequent
a river, you have only to go a little before
sunset; place yourself against any dark bush
or bank, and there wait patiently, and out of
sight, till they come down and fly round you,
which they will generally do several times
before they drop into the stream or marshes.</p>

<p class='c006'>As wild ducks most frequently betake themselves
to the springs and rivers about dusk,
you have no occasion to wait for them longer
than just the last hour, or half, before dark;
but if they have been much disturbed or shot
at, they will not always fly sufficiently early
to be seen, though you may plainly hear the
shrill and somewhat melancholy sound of
their wings. If, however, the twilight is followed
by a full moon, these birds will often
withhold coming to the river till the moon has
completely risen, in which case you might
have to wait till an hour or two after dusk;
but then the sport is considerably better, and
will last much longer, with the additional advantage
of your having continued good light
for shooting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wild ducks generally come to the same
place, unless they have been shot at, or there
should be a change of wind and weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>It often happens that wild ducks, dunbirds,
and other fowl, come down at night to large
rivers, ponds, or lakes, which are so deeply
surrounded by floating reeds, that no one can
approach the water; and the birds, aware of
this, do not lower their flight till they come
near them. So far from this defying the
shooter, it is one of the finest opportunities
that can be afforded for death and destruction.
Let him sit in a small punt or canoe, fore and
aft among the rushes, where towards dusk he
will be so completely hid, that he may either
shoot at birds flying within pistol shot, or wait
for a good chance on the water; from whence
(his boat being hid on each side, and foreshortened
to the only point of view) he will
be pretty sure to escape the observation of the
birds.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_444.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Roach is a handsome fish either in, or fresh
out of the water; it inhabits many of our
deep, still rivers; affecting, like the others of
this genus, quiet waters; it is gregarious,
keeping in large shoals; it has a small head,
a leather mouth, which is round, and also
small, with the teeth in the throat; large
eyes, the circle of which resembles gold colour,
and the iris red; the roach is deep, but
thin, and the back elevated; the scales are
large, and easily fall off; the fins are in general
red, particularly whilst in perfection; as
they may also be known to be by the smoothness
of the scales, which, when out of season,
feel like the rough side of an oyster-shell:
the side-line bends much on the middle, towards
the belly, and the tail is a little forked.
It is so silly a fish, that it has acquired the
name of the water sheep.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many ways are recommended to catch this
fish by angling, when in deep waters, near
piles of bridges, flood-gates, &amp;c.: in hot weather,
a May or ant-fly is to be sunk by a
little lead, within a few inches of the hook,
near the sides of these posts or piles; this is
to be pulled up very leisurely; a roach will
generally attend the fly to the surface, there
gaze on it for a moment, and then take it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stern fishing, is by fixing a boat (for without,
roach of any size are hardly to be caught,)
to the stern of a vessel returned from a voyage,
whose bottom is foul, and furnished with
insects, which the fish greedily devour. The
line should not exceed four feet, the float be
within a foot of its top, and the rod very
short; the bait to be three or four gentles,
and dropt close to the ship’s sides, not allowing
the bait to swim more than eight or nine
feet; begin at the first of the ebb-tide, and
for two hours the roach will bite freely.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Roadster</span>, <i>s.</i> A hackney, a horse kept for the road.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hackney, more than any other variety
of horse, adds to our health and comfort; we
ride him for amusement, and he transports us
long distances on our personal avocations. On
some only of these occasions speed is desirable;
but on all safety is indispensable; and
next to that, is the ease with which his motions
are performed. These requisites remove
the hackney still further than the hunter from
that form which best suits the purposes of the
racer. In the hackney, therefore, we scrutinise
his fore quarters with the same attention
that we pay to the hinder parts of the racer;
for, as to the purposes of the latter, the fore
parts are subordinate to the hinder, so in the
hackney, speed being infinitely less important
than either ease or safety, and particularly the
latter, it is essential that his fore parts be so
formed as to ensure these properties. And
here it may not be irrelevant to inquire, on
what does the safety of action mainly depend?
Is it on any particular care of the animal himself
in his progression? or does it necessarily
arise out of certain peculiarities in his formation,
dependent on such an elevation of his
feet as will ensure his not stumbling by any
erroneous placing of them? The close observer,
I think, will answer, that both are concerned:
many horses go safely, and yet by no
means elevate their legs high; but such are
attentive to their steps; and when they see
stones or other risings in their path, carefully
avoid them. In my early practice I was called
on to examine a horse intended for the French
court, at the stables of that veteran dealer
Choppin. I objected to the horse that he
went close to the ground, which even his
owner could not deny: but he still argued,
that, although he appeared to go near the
ground, yet that he was particularly safe in all
his paces; and, as a lure to the purchase,
would have offered a bet, that on the roughest
ground he would not make one trip. As the
animal in all other respects was desirable,
ground purposely stony in the extreme was
chosen, over which he was tried; and it was
singular to remark, that in every pace he accommodated
the elevation of his feet exactly
to the elevations of surface they were to pass
over; but it was with a kind of frightful
nicety to the observer. On the same ground,
many high actioned horses, from inattention to
the matters on it, might have tripped by meeting
any unusual rising; or, by placing one of
the feet on a rolling stone, might have fallen
altogether. But it is not hence meant to
argue, that the most careful hackney, which
does not naturally elevate his feet, is a desirable
one. Horses, it is true, are in a great
degree crepuscular, and see in a very moderate
light. But would such a horse be safe to ride
at a brisk trot along an uneven road in a
dark night? Or even in a long day, might
not fatigue bring his feet down without his
usual caution?</p>

<p class='c006'>The fore-hand of the hackney, therefore,
should be elevated, and his shoulder by all
means must be oblique; so that he may not
only lift up his feet, but also ride pleasantly
and lightly in hand, as it is termed by horsemen.
To which latter valuable quality it is
also essential that he have a neck of just proportions,
and that his head be particularly
well placed on it, so as to afford him room for
flexing himself to the action of the bridle,
which, in the hands of a good rider, will sometimes
constrain him to throw himself on his
haunches, and at others to carry himself forward
for more speedy progression. The remainder
of the fore limbs ought to present a
perfectly vertical line to the pastern, which
should have such length and obliquity, and
such only, as shall bring the toe directly under
the point of the shoulder. The body
should be circular, neither long nor very short;
his saddle-placing good, his flank on a plane
nearly with the rest of his carcass, his loins
wide, and his croup gently curved only, to allow
of a graceful setting on of the tail. From
hence downwards, the principles already laid
down when treating on the exterior formation
generally, will apply; particularising only,
that for this variety of horse a good foot ought
never to be dispensed with. Height is not so
essential in the hackney as in the hunter; it
need never to exceed fifteen hands two inches:
in most cases it may, with more propriety,
range between fourteen hands three inches,
and fifteen hands one inch. Altogether, his
frame should be compact, without being in
the least clumsy; and with this form, the
more breeding he shows, short of full blood,
the better.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Roan</span>, <i>a.</i> Bay or sorrel, with grey or white spots interspersed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The roans, of every variety of colour and
form, are composed of white mixed with bay,
or red, or black. In some it seems to be a
natural mixture of the colours; in others it
appears as if one colour was powdered or
sprinkled over another. They are pretty
horses for ladies or light carriages, and many
of them easy in their paces, but they do not
usually display much blood, nor are they
celebrated for endurance. If they should
have white fore legs, with white hoofs, they
are too often tender-footed, or become so with
even a little hard work.—<i>The Horse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Roar</span>, <i>v.</i> To cry as a lion or other wild beast; to cry in distress; to sound

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Roaring</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease in horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The causes of roaring, which I shall here
use as a type of the whole, are remote and
proximate. The remote causes are mostly
inflammation, acute or chronic, in the tracheal
tube itself. Occasionally it is brought on by
the effects of inflammation on other parts, as
of the salivary glands in strangles, or of those
abscesses which not unfrequently occur in
violent catarrh in the vicinage of the pharynx.
Structural alteration in the lungs, as hepatisation,
has occasioned it (<i>Percivall’s Lectures</i>,
vol. ii. p. 256). Obstructions accidentally
formed by exostoses, cicatrisations, &amp;c., or
extraneous substances lodged in the cavities
leading to the trachea, may any of them occasion
it. Barriere notices a case of roaring
dependent on the lodgment of a piece of riband
within one of the nasal fossæ; and Godine
another, brought on by a displaced molar
tooth. The proximate cause might, with propriety,
include these accidental obstructions,
but they are mainly to be looked for in an
extravasation, partial or extensive, of coagulable
lymph; which, becoming organised,
forms a permanent obstruction. When it is
extensively spread over the larynx, it produces
wheezing; when it constringes the
rimaglottis, a whistling sound is the consequence,
and is often heard in our own respirations
under catarrh, or in the ordinary
respirations of some asthmatic persons. Whoever
has handled the throats of many old
horses, must have observed the hardened state
of the larynx, which almost resisted all attempts
to what is termed ‘cough them.’ This
ossification of the laryngeal cartilages is not
an uncommon cause; and a similar state in
the cartilages of the trachea is productive of
it also. A very common case also of roaring
is a band of lymph stretched across the tracheal
tube; at others, an internal ring of the same
matter simply diminishes its diameter. The
obstruction is sometimes so considerable as to
excite piping or roaring on the slightest exertion;
in general cases, however, roaring is only
exerted when forcible inspirations and expirations
are made; for it is, I believe, equally
produced by the one as by the other. Mechanical
obstructions to free respiration may
eventually be productive of roaring: the custom
of tightly reining in our carriage-horses,
there is reason to think, produces it often;
and Mr. Sewell is of opinion, that the practice
of using tight throat-lashes, or neck-straps,
may lead to it. In furtherance of which
opinion, it may be recollected, that horsemen
have a very general supposition that crib-biting
ends in roaring, in thick wind, or in broken
wind: may not the tight collar-strap also here
tend to the former of these affections? The
custom of ‘coughing’ horses, and so frequently
as it is practised in fairs, may be readily supposed
as a cause. A horse passes from fair to
fair, having his unfortunate throat brutally
pinched thirty or forty times each day. Is it
to be wondered at if inflammation take place,
and adhesive deposit follow?</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment must be regulated by circumstances,
but the principal indication is to
remove the remote causes in the early stages,
and to obviate the effects in the latter. If
active inflammation be going on, bleed and
blister; and if tumefaction of the neighbouring
parts have occasioned it, attempt their
reduction. Elevate the head as much as may
be. Mr. Sewell recommends a seton in the
neighbourhood of the obstruction when known;
and in desperate cases he observes, that tracheotomy
has been performed with considerable
advantage; but the extreme difficulty of detecting
the exact situation of the obstruction,
will prevent its being generally adverted to.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rock Pigeon</span>, <i>s.</i> (<i>Columba livia</i>, <span class='sc'>Brisson</span>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Ornithologists seem to differ in opinion
concerning the rock and stock pigeon; though
it appears almost impossible to conceive them
a distinct species. In those described under
such names there seems to be so much similitude,
except what may be expected from a
species half reclaimed, and frequently returning
to their natural wild habits again, that we
cannot but consider them as one and the same
species.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rock dove is considered to be the
origin of our tame pigeons, as it is said to
possess the white on the lower part of the back,
in which part the stock dove is described to be
ash-coloured, and that this last is rather larger.
But these variations we have observed in
pigeons killed in their native haunts amongst
the rocks on our coasts; and our dove-cote
pigeons frequently have no white on the back.
It is therefore probable many of our common
species, after having been bred in a pigeon-house
contiguous to such rocky situations,
return to their natural habits, and there produce
some variation in colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bird now before us we killed on the
cliffs in Cauldy Island, in South Wales. It
weighed eleven ounces; length thirteen
inches and a half; breadth twenty-two; the
bill is brown, inclining to purplish-red; point
dusky; irides light yellow; the head dark
bluish ash-colour; neck and breast glossed
with green and copper, as viewed in different
lights, most conspicuous on the sides and
back of the neck; the upper part of the back
and wing coverts pale ash-colour; across the
middle of the greater coverts is a broad band
of black, and another of the same on the
ends of the secondary quills, running into
each other on those feathers nearest the body;
the greater quills are dusky, dashed with ash-colour,
the outer ones darkest, and all of them
most so towards the tips, slightly edged on
their exterior webs with white; the lower
part of the back white; the rump and tail
dark bluish ash-colour, the ends of the latter
black; the two exterior feathers whitish on
the outer webs towards the base; the sides
under the wings, and under wing coverts,
white; the belly bluish ash-colour; legs red.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds have sometimes appeared in prodigious
flocks in winter, frequenting our beech
woods for the sake of the mast or seed of that
tree. These flights, however, are less numerous
and less frequent of late years. Sometimes
they are seen in company with our
common pigeons, at the barn doors, in severe
winters; and are said to be known by their
inferior size and darker colour.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The only place where I have ever seen the
rock dove in a wild state, was at Howford,
near Mauchlane, in Ayrshire, where two or
three pairs nestled on the cliffs of the romantic
rocks overhanging the river, but in situations
so inaccessible, that I never knew them
robbed by the most daring boys. It would
be hard to say whether these had strayed
from some neighbouring dove-cote, or had
originally come thither from some wild brood;
though the former is not so probable, as instances,
I believe, are rare, of domestic pigeons
voluntarily deserting their birth place.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Rennie.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The wood for fishing rods should be cut
about Christmas (and some insist that if left
in the open air for twelve months afterwards
it will season better, than if stowed in a dry
place). Hazel is the wood generally procured
for this purpose, and of all the sorts
that of the cob-nut grows to the greatest
length, and is, for the most part, straight and
taper; the butt-end should rather exceed an
inch in diameter; but of whatever wood the
rod is composed, the shoots for stocks, middle
pieces, and tops, must be of proper size,
well-grown, and as free from knots as possible.
The tops should be the best rush-ground
shoots, without knots, and proportionally
taper; the excrescent twigs are to be cut off,
but not close, for fear of hurting the bark,
which ought never to be touched with a knife
or rasp; for, although they will dress neater,
it considerably weakens them: these pieces
are to be kept free from wet until the beginning
of the following autumn, when such as
are wanted to form a rod should be selected,
and, after being warmed over a gentle fire, set
as straight as possible, and laid aside for two
or three days, when they must be rubbed over
with a piece of flannel and linseed oil, which
will polish and fetch off any superfluous bark;
they are then to be bound tight to a straight
pole, and so kept until the next spring, when
they will be seasoned for use; (some, however,
prefer keeping them from eighteen months to
two years, before they are made up); they
are then to be matched together in just proportion,
in three, four, or more parts, according
to the width of the water, or the wish of
the maker; taking care that the different
joints fit so nicely, if ferruled, that the whole
rod may move as if it were but one piece. If
the parts are not ferruled, observe, that they
must be cut to join each other with the utmost
exactness, and neatly spliced with glue,
boiled very gently in strong quick lime-water,
keeping it stirred until it becomes smooth and
all alike, and then are to be whipped over the
glued part with waxed thread.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Elder, holly, yew, mountain ash, and hip
briar, are all natives; the former, prepared as
follows, is by some thought to excel any of
the latter; a branch of the elder tree of three
years’ growth is to be cut about the third week
in November; it is then with a saw to be
separated at every joint; sometimes, when
the branch is exactly straight, a length of two
joints may be made, for the two shoots which
spring from each joint grow alternately from
the different sides; these double lengths
should be taken from the biggest end of the
branch, and will be near three quarters of a
yard long; one of these will make the thick
end of the top; the other joints are split into
four, shaving off the bark and the pith, and
every joint tied by itself; the thick end of
every piece should be placed towards the butt
of the rod; after being split, the pieces should
be tied together, and kept a year at least to
season; when wanted, they should be first
planed and rasped taper, and square; the
edges then filed off exactly round and smooth;
the splice must be rubbed very thin with shoe-makers’
wax, filling the outside of the joint so,
that when wrapped close with fine white silk,
the splice may not be bigger than the joint is,
an inch above it. The hip briar is easily
found in hedges of old inclosures, which have
not been plashed for many years; but it should
be thoroughly seasoned before it is split, or
the small pieces will be apt to warp in drying;
it is cut into lengths of eight or ten inches for
tops, spliced or glued together; after which
they are properly tapered with planes and fine
rasps, finished off with sandpaper, and the
joints wrapped with silk well waxed; a small
piece of whalebone is added to the wood,
spliced and wrapped in a similar manner; to
this finish, however, some gentlemen object,
and wonder at the prevalent custom of loading
rods with eight or ten inches of whalebone
at the top, since that particular part should be
light and elastic; and they contend, that the
whalebone is dull, heavy, and much too flexible;
the Scotch fishing rod makers use tortoise
shell at the end of their tops, and it is
lighter and springs better than whalebone.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The reed or cane rod, on account of its
lightness and elasticity, is the best for fishing
at the bottom, whether with a running line
or float, especially when angling for those fish
which bite tenderly, as roach and dace; of
these some are contrived to go into the butt,
and make a walking stick, others are composed
of many short joints; all of which are inclosed
in a bag. The tackle shops have a variety
of these; but in purchasing a reed or
cane rod, be careful that it strikes well, and
that the bark which grows round the joints,
is not rasped into; a very common fault which
the rod makers are guilty of; and the consequence
of which is, that it is thereby rendered
weaker at the joints than elsewhere, and there
being no bark to repel the wet, it soon rots,
and whenever a large fish is hooked, certainly
breaks. Another thing to be observed is, that
the medium between the ferrule and the joint
that goes in, is not cut too fine; if it is, and a
good fish is struck, it is odds but a part of the
rod, line, and fish, are all lost together.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The rod composed of the hazel will not do
for fly-fishing, the least wet being apt to warp
and render it crooked.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Another rod for fly-fishing, is recommended
to be of two parts, without ferrules, and the
lower longer than the upper, with the small
end of the former, and the large end of the
latter, cut long, and to fit nicely as for splicing;
it may be tied together at the water side
with common shoemakers’ common waxed
thread; this is by far the best, for throwing
the line with freedom and accuracy; and for
easing it in playing the fish when hooked, the
spring will be superior, if properly made, to
that of the other sort of rods: upon leaving
off fishing the rod should be untied, and the
string wrapped round the two parts, for carrying
it more conveniently.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Yew, especially the white of it, makes a
fine top, and the best forest yew is to be got
in Wales; but unless very well chosen, frequently
turns out brittle, from its numerous
knots. Holly is liable to the same objection;
all kinds of wood should be cut in winter
when the sap is descended into the root, and
kept a year or two, oiling them now and then
with linseed oil, and placing them in such a
position, that they acquire no bend, which
should they do, it may be rectified by holding
them over a gentle fire. Of foreign woods,
the hiccory from America, will work into
handsome and good tops; but the bamboo, or
hollow cane, from the West Indies, is to be
preferred; in making a top of the latter, care
should be taken to preserve the outside, that
being its most elastic part; at the extremity
of all tops, there should be a loop of hair or
a ring for fastening the line to.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A rod of twelve feet, unless the wind be
extremely unfavourable, will cast a fly-line of
fourteen yards, but if it is to carry a reel line,
fourteen feet will be preferable; it is useless
to encumber yourself with an unnecessary
weight of wood, as the great advantage of a
light rod is, that with either hand you can use
it, and thus be enabled to cast your fly under
bushes, hollow banks, &amp;c., where the best
trout generally lie, without endangering the
tackle; the shorter the joints, of course it will
be more portable, but the fewer there are, the

<p class='c006'>The great defect in most rods is, that the
play is in the middle, owing to that part being
too weak, and like a waggon whip; with a rod
of this kind, it is impossible to strike or command
a fish of any size.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Rods should not be kept in too dry a room;
the practice of steeping them in water before
using, is bad, and will soon spoil them; the
rubbing the tops with sweet oil twice or thrice
in the season will preserve them in a serviceable
state, and if the rod be hollow, tie a rag
to the end of a stick, dip it in linseed oil, and
rub it well about the inside of the different
joints.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rook</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird resembling a crow; it feeds not on carrion but grain; a
piece at chess.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is about the size of the carrion
crow, and, except its more glossy plumage,
very much resembles it. The base of the bill
and nostrils, as far as the eyes, is covered with
a white scabrous skin, in which it differs from
all the rest, occasioned, it is said, by thrusting
its bill into the earth in search of worms;
but as the same appearance has been observed
in such as have been brought up tame, and
unaccustomed to that mode of subsistence, we
are inclined to consider it as an original peculiarity.
We have already had occasion to
observe, that they are useful in preventing a
too great increase of that destructive insect
the chafer, or dor-beetle, and thereby make
large recompense for the depredations they
may occasionally commit on the corn-fields.
Rooks are gregarious, and fly in immense
flocks, at morning and evening, to and from
their roosting places, in quest of food. During
the breeding time they live together in
large societies, and build their nests on trees
close to each other, frequently in the midst of
large and populous towns. These rookeries,
however, are often the scenes of bitter contests;
the new-comers are frequently driven
away by the old inhabitants, their half-built
nests torn in pieces, and the unfortunate couple
forced to begin their work anew, in some
more undisturbed situation. Of this we had
a remarkable instance in Newcastle: in the
year 1783, a pair of rooks, after an unsuccessful
attempt to establish themselves in a rookery
at no great distance from the Exchange,
were compelled to abandon the attempt.
They took refuge on the spire of that building,
and although constantly interrupted by
other rooks, built their nest on the top of the
vane, and brought forth their young, undisturbed
by the noise of the populace below
them; the nest and its inhabitants turning
about with every change of the wind. They
returned and built their nest every year on
the same place, till 1793, soon after which
the spire was taken down.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The minute description of rooks is needless;
the rooks may always be known from the
carrion crow, by their being in flocks, whereas
the crows go only in pairs; and also by the
white colour of the bill, and from their being
bare of feathers upon that part in which the
crow is well clothed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rook is a gregarious bird, being sometimes
seen in numbers so as almost to darken
the air in their flight, which they regularly
perform morning and evening, except in the
breeding time, when the daily attendance of
both male and female is required for incubation,
or feeding the young; and it is observed
they do both alternately. They begin to build
in March; one bringing materials, while the
other watches the nest, lest it should be plundered
by its brethren: they lay five or six
eggs, of a pale green colour, marked with small
brownish spots. After the breeding season,
rooks forsake their nest-trees, going to roost
elsewhere; but return to them in August,
and again in October, when they repair their
nests. The young birds are very good when
skinned, steeped in milk, and afterwards put
into a pie. Hawker recommends cold water
instead of milk.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There is one trait in the character of the
rook which is, I believe, peculiar to that bird,
and which does him no little credit; it is the
distress which they exhibit when one of them
has been killed or wounded by a gun, while
they have been feeding in a field or flying
over it. Instead of being scared away by the
report of the gun, leaving their wounded or
dead companion to his fate, they show the
greatest anxiety and sympathy for him, uttering
cries of distress, and plainly proving that
they wish to render him assistance, by hovering
over him, or sometimes making a dart
from the air close up to him, apparently to
try and find out the reason why he did not
follow them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“While circling round and round,</div>
      <div class='line'>They call their lifeless comrade from the ground.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If he is wounded, and can flutter along the
ground, the rooks appear to animate him to
make fresh exertions by incessant cries, flying
a little distance before him, and calling to
him to follow them. I have seen one of my
labourers pick up a rook so wounded, which
he shot at for the purpose of putting him up
as a scare-crow in a field of wheat; and while
the poor wounded bird was still fluttering in
his hand, I have observed one of his companions
make a wheel round in the air, and suddenly
dart past him so as almost to touch him, perhaps
with a last hope that he might still afford
assistance to his unfortunate mate or
companion. Even when the dead bird has
been hung, <i>in terrorem</i>, to a stake in the
field, he has been visited by some of his former
friends, but as soon as they found that
the case was hopeless, they have generally
abandoned that field altogether.</p>

<p class='c006'>When one considers the instinctive care
with which rooks avoid any one carrying a gun,
and which is so evident, that I have often
heard country-people remark that they can
smell gunpowder, one can more justly estimate
the force of their love or friendship in
thus continuing to hover round a person who
has just destroyed one of their companions
with an instrument, the dangerous nature of
which they seem fully capable of appreciating.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rooks are not easily induced to forsake
the trees on which they have been bred, and
which they frequently revisit after the breeding
season is over. This is shown in Hampton
Court Park, where there is an extensive
rookery among the fine lime-trees, and where
a barbarous and unnecessary custom prevails
of shooting the young rooks. As many as a
hundred dozen of them have been killed in
one season, and yet the rooks build in the
avenue, though there is a corresponding
avenue close by in Bushy Park, which they
never frequent, notwithstanding the trees are
equally high and equally secure. I never
hear the guns go off during this annual
slaughter without execrating the practice, and
pitying the poor rooks, whose melancholy
cries may be heard to a great distance, and
some of whom may be seen, exhausted by
their fruitless exertions, sitting melancholy
on a solitary tree waiting till the sport is over,
that they may return and see whether any of
the offspring which they have reared with
so much care and anxiety are left to them;
or, what is more probable, the call for assistance
of their young having ceased, they
are aware of their fate, and are sitting in
mournful contemplation of their loss. This
may appear romantic, but it is nevertheless
true; and whoever, like myself, has observed
the habits and manners of the rook, and witnessed
their attachment to each other and to
their young,—and is convinced, as I am, that
they have the power of communication by
means of a language known to themselves,
and are endowed with a knowledge and foresight
most extraordinary, will take as much
interest in them as I have confessed that
I do.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A gentleman in this neighbourhood had
two milk-white rooks in one nest. A booby
of a carter, finding them before they were
able to fly, threw them down, and destroyed
them, to the regret of the owner, who would
have been glad to have preserved such a curiosity
in his rookery. I saw the birds myself
nailed against the end of a barn, and was surprised
to find that their bills, legs, feet, and
claws were milk-white.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Passage hawks are also used for rooks.
These birds sometimes mount like herons,
but their flight is in general much lower.
They must be found in an open country; and
the wood, which is their place of retreat, must
be so situated as to oblige them to fly against
the wind to gain in.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>White’s

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rouge et Noir</span>, <i>s.</i> A game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rouge et noir, or red and black, is a modern
game, so styled, not from the cards, but from
the colours marked on the tapis or green cloth
with which the table is covered.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first parcel of cards played is usually
for noir, the second for rouge, though sometimes
the cards are cut to determine which
shall begin. All the terms of this game are
French, and that language is used in playing.
Any number of persons may play, and the punters
may risk their money on which colour they
please, placing the stakes in the outer semicircle;
but after the first card is turned up, no
other stakes can be laid for that coup.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tailleur and croupier seat themselves
opposite each other, with a basket for receiving
the cards of every coup after dealing, which is
placed on the middle of the table. The tailleur
then passing round six packs of cards to
be shuffled and mixed confusedly all together
by the company, afterwards finally shuffles
them, and inserts all the end cards into various
parts of the 312, till he meets with an honour,
which being placed upright at the end, is offered
to a punter, who, putting the same into
any part of the pack, the tailleur there separates
it, and lays that part which was below the
said honour uppermost, and taking therefrom a
handful of cards, and placing a weight upon the
remainder, proceeds to deal, taking afterwards
other parcels from the heap as they may be
wanted, till all are dealt out. He looks at
the first card, and puts its face downwards; two
others, one red, the other black, are then laid
back to back, and that placed conspicuously uppermost
which is of a similar colour with the
first card; these two cards are turned according
to the colour of the card which afterwards
may be first dealt in each succeeding coup.
When the stakes are deposited, the tailleur
cries noir, turns the top card, and places each
succeeding one in a row, till the points of those
so turned shall exceed thirty; he then declares
the numbers at trente and une, one and thirty;
or, if above that, up to forty he only says, deux,
trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and
when forty, quarante.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another parcel is then dealt in a similar
mode for rouge, and the punters win who had
staked on that colour, the points for which were
thirty-one or nearest to it, which the tailleur
declares, by saying rouge gagne, red wins; or
rouge perd, red loses. These two parcels, one
for each colour, make a coup. When the same
number is dealt for each, the tailleur says,
apres, after, which forms un refait, or doublet,
by which neither party loses, except it is un
refait trente et un, one-and-thirty, when the
tailleur wins half the stakes punted on each
colour, which half the punters may either pay,
or have their stakes moved into the middle
semicircles of the colour they then choose,
called la première prison, the first prison, to be
determined by the next event, whether they
lose all or are set at liberty; but if un refait
second trente and un, a second doublet of one
and thirty, should occur in the next succeeding
deal, the punters lose only one half of their
remaining moiety, making three-fourths of
their original stakes, and are removed into the
smallest semicircle, styled la seconde prison,
the second prison, and the next coup determines
whether the punter loses all, or is to be
removed again into la première prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Punters after winning may paroli, &amp;c., and
pursue their luck up to a soixante, as at faro;
but as no livrets are used at rouge et noir, they
cannot make either paix or pont.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this game a banker cannot refuse any
stake not exceeding his fund; which the punter
declares, by saying je va la banque, va la
banque, or va banque, I aim at the bank.
Bankers generally furnish punters with slips
of card paper, ruled in columns, each marked
N. or R. at the top on which accounts are kept
by pricking with a pin, and when un refait
happens, the same is denoted by running the
pin through the middle line. Some bankers
give up the profit of le refait during the first
deal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The odds against le refait being deals, are
reckoned sixty-three to one, but bankers expect
it twice in three deals, and there are generally
from twenty-nine to thirty-two coups
in each deal.—<i>Hoyle.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Rowels are seldom so convenient or so useful
as setons. They are formed by making an
incision in the skin, where it is rather loose,
as in the chest, about an inch in length. This
being done, the finger is to be introduced, or
an instrument called a cornet, that is, the
crooked end of a small horn made for the
purpose, and the skin separated from the parts
underneath all around for the space of about
an inch. Into the cavity thus made a round
piece of leather, with a hole in the middle,
wrapped in tow and smeared with digestive
ointment, is to be introduced. The orifice in
the skin is then to be plugged up with tow,
and kept there until suppuration takes place,
that is, four or five days. The tow is then to
be taken out, when a great deal of matter will
flow from the orifice. The rowel is afterwards
to be moved daily and kept clean.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rud</span>, <i>s.</i> A fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The body of the rud is broader than the carp,
more like that of the bream, but much thicker;
the head is small, the palate and teeth like the
carp, on the covers of the gills are spots of a
blood colour; the irides are yellow, varying in
some almost to redness; the nostrils large, and
by some said to be double on each side; the
back is arched, sloping off suddenly at the two
extremities; the scales are very large, like the
carp; the side line is slightly incurvated: the
back is of an olive; the sides and belly are of
a gold colour, with certain red marks; the ventral,
anal fins, and the tail (which is forked),
are generally of a deep red, and the dorsal fin
is darker than the rest; the usual length of this
fish is from ten to sixteen inches. It lives on
insects and grass, and is preyed on by the voracious
fish and the anseres. In rivers the rud’s
haunts are in deepish gentle streams and deep
still water, where the bottom is a kind of slimy
mud sand, or fine gravel, and also among
weeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are always in season, except at the
time of spawning, which is in April, when the
male fish have small white spots about their
heads, and the scales of both sexes feel more
rough; they swim in shoals, casting their spawn
upon and among the aquatic plants, to the
number according to the Elements of Natural
History, of 91,000 ova.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their flesh is exceedingly wholesome, and
holds a distinguished rank for its fine flavour;
but they are very scarce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Pennant believes the shallow of the
Cam, which grows to the length of thirteen
inches, and spawns in April, to be no other fish
than the rud.</p>

<p class='c006'>The angler will find the rud worth his attention;
the tackle must be strong, but fine,
with a quill float, and a hook proportioned to
the bait; the same ground-bait is to be used as
for carp and chub, fishing about the same depths
as for the latter, except on the ground, for they
feed naturally near the surface; they will in
this way take red-worms, gentles, wasp-maggots,
caddis, and red-paste. Some use a ground-bait
of boiled malt, and prefer a small red
worm to any other bait. In fishing among
weeds, have neither float nor shot, and let the
worm, or other bait sink a little under water:
at top they are taken either with natural or artificial
flies, by whipping with a long, and dibbing
or bobbing with a short line. In warm,
bright weather, the rud will bite early and late;
when coolish, the fore and afternoons; and in
winter, the middle of the day; when hooked this
fish struggles hard, and requires time in landing,
and is so tenacious of life, as to retain it after
being taken out of the water a considerable
time.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_453.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The male of this curious species is called
the ruff, and the female the reeve: they differ
materially in their exterior appearance; and
also, what is remarkable in wild birds, it very
rarely happens that two ruffs are alike in the
colours of their plumage. The singular, wide-spreading,
variegated tuft of feathers which,
in the breeding season, grows out of their
necks, is different in all. The tuft, or ruff,
a portion of which stands up like ears behind
each eye, is in some black, in others black
and yellow, and in others again white, rust
colour, or barred with glossy violet, black
and white. They are, however, more nearly
alike in other respects: they measure about a
foot in length, and two in breadth, and when
first taken weigh about seven ounces and a
half; the female seldom exceeds four. The
bill is more than an inch long, black at the
tip, and reddish yellow towards the base; the
irides are hazel: the whole face is covered
with reddish tubercles, or pimples; the wing
coverts are brownish ash colour; the upper
parts and the breast are generally marked
with transverse bars, and the scapulars with
roundish-shaped glossy black spots, on a rusty
coloured ground; quills dusky; belly, vent,
and tail coverts white; the tail is brown; the
four middle feathers of it are barred with
black; the legs are yellow. The male does
not acquire the ornament of his neck till the
second season, and, before that time, is not
easily distinguished from the female, except
by being larger. After moulting, at the
end of June, he loses his ruff and the red
tubercles on his face, and from that time
until the spring of the year, he again, in the
plumage, looks like his mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds leave Great Britain in the
winter, and are then supposed to associate
with others of the tringa genus, among which
they are no longer recognised as the ruff and
reeve. In the spring, as soon as they arrive
again in England, and take up their abode in
the fens where they were bred, each of the
males (of which there appears to be a much
greater number than of the females) immediately
fixes upon a particular dry and grassy
spot in the marsh, about which he runs round
and round, until it is trodden bare; to this
spot, it appears, he wishes to invite the female,
and waits in expectation of her taking a joint
possession, and becoming an inmate. As soon
as a single female arrives, and is heard or observed
by the males, her feeble cry seems as
if it roused them all to war, for they instantly
begin to fight, and their combats are described
as being both desperate and of long continuance:
at the end of the battle she becomes
the prize of the victor. It is at the time of
these battles that they are caught in the
greatest numbers in the nets of the fowlers,
who watch for that opportunity: they are also,
at other times, caught by clap, or day-nets,
and are drawn together by means of a stuffed
reeve, or what is called a stale bird, which is
placed in some suitable spot for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ruff is highly esteemed as a most delicious
dish, and is sought after with great
eagerness by the fowlers, who live by catching
them and other fen birds for the markets of
the metropolis, &amp;c. Before they are offered
for sale, they are commonly put up to feed
for about a fortnight, and during that time
fed with boiled wheat, and bread and milk
mixed with hempseed, to which sugar is
sometimes added: by this mode of treatment
they become very fat, and are often sold as
high as two shillings and sixpence each. They
are cooked in the same manner as the woodcock.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female, in the beginning of May, makes
her nest in a dry tuft of grass in the fens,
and lays four white eggs, marked with rusty
spots.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are common in the summer
season in the fens of Denmark, Sweden, and
Russia, and are also found in other more
northern regions, even as far as Iceland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trade of catching ruffs is confined to a
very few persons. They live in obscure
places on the verge of the fens, and are found
out with difficulty; for few, if any birds, are
ever bought, but by those who make a trade
of fatting them for the table; and they sedulously
conceal the abode of the fowlers; so
much so, that by no art could we obtain from
any of them where they resided; and in order
to deceive us, after evading our entreaties,
they gave us instructions that led us quite a
contrary direction. The reason of all this
was obvious; for after much labour and search
in the most obscure places, (for neither the
innkeepers, nor other inhabitants of the towns,
could give any information, and many did not
know such a bird was peculiar to their fens,)
we found out a very civil and intelligent
fowler, who resided close to Spalding, at Fengate,
by name William Burton (we feel a
pleasure in recording his name, not only from
his obliging nature, but for the use of others
in similar pursuits); and, strange to say, that
although this man had constantly sold ruffs
to Mr. Towns, a noted feeder, hereafter more
particularly noticed, as also to another feeder
at Cowbit, by the name of Weeks, neither
of those persons could be induced to inform
us even of the name of this fowler. The reason,
however, was evident, and justly remarked
by Burton, for he obtained no more than ten
shillings per dozen, whereas Weeks demanded
thirty shillings for the like number he had
the same day bought of Burton. The season
was far advanced, and we were obliged to buy
some at that price of Weeks, for Burton
could not then catch us as many as were required.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this time we were shown into a room
where there were about seven dozen males
and a dozen females, and of the former there
were not two alike. This intrusion to choose
our birds, drove them from their stands, and
compelling some to trespass upon the premises
of others, produced many battles.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this feeder we learned, that two guineas
a dozen was now the price for fattened
ruffs; and he never remembered the price
under thirty shillings, when fit for table.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Towns, the noted feeder at Spalding,
assured us his family had been a hundred
years in the trade, and boasted they had
served George the Second, and many noble
families in the kingdom. He undertook, at
the desire of the late Marquess of Townsend,
when that nobleman was Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, to take some ruffs to that country,
and actually set off with twenty-seven dozen
from Lincolnshire; left seven dozen at the
Duke of Devonshire’s, at Chatsworth; continued
his route across the kingdom, to Holyhead;
and delivered seventeen dozen alive in
Ireland; having lost only three dozen in so
long a journey, confined and greatly crowded
as they were in baskets, which were carried
upon two horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manner of taking these birds is somewhat
different in the two seasons; in the
spring, the ruffs hill, as it is termed; that is,
they assemble upon a rising spot of ground,
contiguous to where the reeves propose to
deposit their eggs; there they take their stand,
at a small distance from each other, and contend
for the females; the nature of polygamous
birds. This hill, or place of resort for
love and battle, is sought for by the fowler,
who, from habit, discovers it by the birds
having trodden the turf somewhat bare, though
not in a circle as usually described.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a hill has been discovered, the fowler
repairs to the spot before the break of
day, spreads his net, places his decoy birds,
and takes his stand at the distance of about
one hundred and forty yards, or more, according
to the shyness of the birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The net is what is termed a single clap-net,
about seventeen feet in length, and six wide,
with a pole at each end; this, by means of
uprights fixed in the ground, and each furnished
with a pulley, is easily pulled over the
birds within reach, and rarely fails taking all
within its grasp; but in order to give the pull
the greatest velocity, the net is, (if circumstances
will permit) placed so as to fold over
with the wind: however there are some fowlers,
who prefer pulling it against the wind
for plovers. As the ruffs feed chiefly by night,
they repair to their frequented hill at the
dawn of day, nearly all at the same time, and
the fowler makes his first pull according to
circumstances, takes out his birds, and prepares
for the stragglers who traverse the fens,
and who have no adopted hill; these are
caught singly, being enticed by the stuffed
birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Burton, who was before mentioned, never
used anything but stuffed skins, executed in a
very rude manner; but some fowlers keep
the first ruffs they catch for decoy birds;
these have a string of about two feet long
tied above the knee, and fastened down to
the ground. The stuffed skins are sometimes
so managed as to be moveable by means of a
long string, so that a jerk represents a jump,
(a motion very common amongst ruffs, who at
the sight of a wanderer flying by, will leap or
flirt a yard off the ground,) by that means inducing
those on the wing to come and alight
by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stuffed birds are prepared by filling
the skin with a wisp of straw tied together,
the legs having been first cut off, and the skin
afterwards sewed along the breast and belly,
but with no great attention to cover the straw
beneath: into this straw a stick is thrust, to
fix it into the ground, and a peg is also thrust
through the top of the head, and down the
neck into the stuffing or straw body, and the
wings are closed by the same process. Rough
as this preparation is, and as unlike a living
bird as skin and feathers can be made, it answers
all the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the reeves begin to lay, both those
and the ruffs are least shy, and so easily
caught, that a fowler assured us he could with
certainty take every bird on the fen in the
season. The females continue this boldness,
and their temerity increases as they become
broody; on the contrary, we found the males
at that time could not be approached within
the distance of musket shot, and consequently
were far beyond the reach of small shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were astonished to observe the property
that these fowlers have acquired, of distinguishing
so small an object as a ruff at such
an immense distance, which, amongst a number
of tufts or tumps, could not by us be distinguished
from one of those inequalities; but
their eyes had been in long practice of looking
for the one object.</p>

<p class='c006'>The autumnal catching is usually about
Michaelmas, at which time few old males are
taken, from which an opinion has been formed
that they migrate before the females and
young. It is, however, more probable, that
the few which are left after the spring fowling,
like other polygamous birds, keep in parties
separate from the female and her brood
till the return of spring. That some old ruffs
are occasionally taken in the autumnal fowling
we have the assertion of experienced
fowlers, but we must admit that others declare
none are taken at this season. It must,
however, be recollected, that in the autumn
the characteristic long feathers have been discharged,
and consequently young and old
males have equally their plain dress; but the
person who assured us that old birds were
sometimes taken at that season, declared it
was easy to distinguish them from the young
of that summer.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not appear to be the opinion of
fowlers, that the males are more than one
season arriving at maturity, because the ruffs
taken in the spring, destitute of the characteristic
long feathers, which constitute their principal
distinction, are comparatively few to
those possessing the ruff: the opinion, therefore,
that those ruffless males are birds of a
very late brood of the preceding season, is a
reasonable conjecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long feathers on the neck and sides of
the head, in the male, that constitute the ruff
and auricles, are of short duration, for they
are scarcely completed in the month of May,
and begin to fall the latter end of June. The
change of these singular parts is accompanied
by a complete change of plumage; the
stronger colours, such as purple, chestnut,
and some others, vanish at the same time, so
that in their winter dress they become more
generally alike from being less varied in plumage;
but we observed that those which had
the ruff more or less white, retained that colour
about the neck after the summer or
autumnal moulting was effected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females, or reeves, begin laying their
eggs the first or second week in May; and we
have found their nests with young as early as
the third of June. By this time the males
cease to hill.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nest is usually formed upon a tump in
the most swampy places, surrounded by coarse
grass, of which it is also formed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eggs are (as usual with its congeners)
four in number; these are so nearly similar
in colour to those of the snipe and redshank,
both of which breed in the same wet places,
and make similar nests, that some experience
is required to discriminate them; they are,
however, superior in size to the former, and
are known from the latter by the ground being
of a greenish hue instead of rufous white;
but individuals assimilate so nearly to each
other as not to be distinguished, especially
as the dusky and brown spots and blotches
are similar. The weight of the eggs is from
five drachms twenty-five grains, to five drachms
fifty grains.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ruffe</span>, <i>s.</i> A fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ruffe somewhat resembles a perch,
though the form is more slender, and the
length rarely exceeds six inches; the teeth
are very small, and disposed in rows; it is
marked on the jaws with a double course of
half circles; the upper part of the eye is of a
dark-brown; the lower part somewhat yellow,
and the globe of it black: the first rays
of the dorsal fin (which is spotted with black)
are like those of the perch, strong, sharp, and
spiny; the others soft; the body is covered
with rough compact scales; the back and sides
are of a dirty green; the last, as well as the
belly, inclining to yellow, but both spotted,
with the tail marked with transverse bars of
black. Their principal spawning-time is the
beginning of April, but some are said to spawn
again in October; and, in the Elements of
Natural History, are said to deposit 75,000
ova. To the young angler the ruffe yields
good sport; they associate in great numbers;
their haunts are in recluse places, where the
water is deep, and runs quietly, with a loamy
or muddy bottom, and also in still water; the
tackle should be fine, the hook No. 7, and a
quill float; the bait (a small, well scoured
red-worm) must just run on the ground, and
either throw in some clay-balls, with worms,
as directed in perch fishing, or if the water be
clear, use common mud-balls to colour it;
three rods may be easily managed, the baits
touching the bottom; when there is a bite,
strike directly, for they gorge so hastily, that
the disgorger, or a knife, must frequently be
used to get out the hook; by thus angling
for them, six or eight dozen are often caught
at a standing. Either in the spring or summer,
with a brisk, warm wind, they will bite
all day; and will sometimes in cold weather
take the bait very freely. The ruffe, for the
delicacy and richness of its flavour, as well as
for its being considered very nourishing, is
more admired than the perch. They are to
be dressed in the same manner.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This dog is of a large size, being considerably
superior, in point of strength, to the
Newfoundland dog. He was originally produced
by a cross between the Newfoundland
and the Siberian, and has now assumed the
characteristics of a distinct race: his head is
large, with moderately long ears, and his tail
bent over his back, like that of most of the
boreal varieties; his hair is very long and
curled, being from seven to nine inches in
length; and in colour he varies from white
with black patches, to pure white, and sometimes
is entirely black. He has an expressive
and intelligent countenance, and possesses all
those qualities for which the Newfoundland
dog is famous. In Russia this animal is employed
for watching property, which he defends
with all the assiduity of a mastiff or Newfoundland
dog. He is sometimes also used in
hunting the wolf and wild boar, for which he
is admirably adapted, from his great strength,
and from possessing considerable swiftness.
His feet are semi-webbed, and he swims with
great ease, and is accordingly often used in
shooting aquatic birds, which he fetches out of
the water when killed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dogs of Russia are not so quarrelsome
amongst themselves as the British, probably
owing to their never being encouraged to fight:
and I am informed by a gentleman who resided
twelve years in that country, that he
never even heard of a dogfight there.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

the stack or the boat-full, and hence more fuel
was wasted in my lodge, than would supply

salivated, many years before, by a
mercurial preparation applied by the keeper
for the cure of mange. The submuriate of
mercury (calomel) is, likewise, very irregular
in its action on dogs; I have seen eight grains
fail to open the bowels of a small one, while,
on the contrary, I have been called to a pointer
fatally poisoned by ten grains. It forms
however, a useful auxiliary to purgatives, in
doses of three or four grains; and as it not
unfrequently acts on the stomach, so it may
be used with advantage as an emetic in some
cases, particularly in conjunction with tartarised
antimony (tartar emetic). When, therefore,
a purgative is brought up again, in which
calomel was a component part, it may be suspected
to arise from this source, and, if it is
necessary to repeat the purge, the mercurial
should be omitted.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p>THE SALMON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the latter end of the year, and some in
November, salmon begin to press up the rivers
as far as they can reach, in order to spawn;
when that period approaches, and they have
accommodated themselves with a fit place,
nature supplies the male with a bony excrescence,
growing out of the end of the lower
jaw, to the length of half an inch or more:
this, it is said, aids him in the removal of the
gravel, but both male and female assist in
forming a proper receptacle for the spawn, in
the sand or gravel, about eighteen inches deep.
In this the ova and milt are deposited, and
carefully covered by the parent fish, who afterwards
hasten to cleanse and recover themselves
(the male loses the gristle at the jaw); for,
after spawning, they become very poor and lean,
and then are called kipper. At their first
entrance into the fresh water, salmon are observed
to have abundance of insects adhering
to them, especially above the gills: these
animals denote the fish to be in high season,
and die and drop off soon after the salmon’s
leaving the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spawn lies buried until spring, and,
without any other care, is nourished and
brought to perfection, if not disturbed by violent
floods, or by depredations from other fish,
of which the eel, roach, dace, and grayling,
are dangerous neighbours. About the latter
end of March, the spawn begins to exclude
the young, which gradually increase to four
or five inches in length, and are then termed
smelts, or smouts; about the beginning of
May the river seems to be alive, and there is
no framing an idea of the numbers without
seeing them. A seasonable flood, however,
hurries them to the sea, very few being left
in the river. About the middle of June the
earliest fry commence their return from the
sea into the river (at that period from twelve
to sixteen inches long), and progressively augment
in number and size, until about the end
of July, which is, at Berwick, the height of
the grilse time (the name there given to the fish
of that age). Early in August they lessen in
number, but advance in bigness, some being
from six to as high as nine pounds’ weight.
This increase appears surprisingly quick; yet
a gentleman of Warrington has given an instance
of still more rapid growth: a kipper
salmon, weighing seven pounds three quarters,
taken on the 7th of February, was marked
with scissors on the back fin and tail, and
turned into the river; he was again taken on
the 17th of the following March, and then
weighed seventeen pounds and a half. In this
case the remark of Walton seems to have
been more than verified, “that the samlet
becomes a salmon in as short a time as a gosling
becomes a goose.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The salmon in Lough Erne increase in size
wonderfully, and young ones, which were
caught and marked when going into the lake,
have been caught on their return, and found
so large, that they must have increased at the
rate of one pound per week.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The migratory habits of the salmon, and
the instinct with which it periodically revisits
its native river, are curious circumstances in
the natural history of this fish. As the swallow
returns annually to its nest, as certainly
the salmon repairs to the same spot in which
to deposit its ova. Many interesting experiments
have established this fact. M. De
Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon’s
tail, and found that for three successive seasons
it returned to the same place. Dr. Bloch
states, that gold and silver rings have been
attached by eastern princes to salmon, to prove
that a communication existed between the
Persian Gulf and the Caspian and Northern
Seas, and that the experiment succeeded.
Shaw, in his Zoology, mentions that a salmon
of seven pounds and three quarters was marked
with scissors on the back fin and tail, and
turned out on the 7th of February, and that
it was retaken in March of the succeeding
year, and found to have increased to the amazing
size of seventeen pounds and a half. This
statement, by the by, is at variance with the
theory of Dr. Bloch, who estimates the weight
of a five or six year old salmon at but ten or
twelve pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the salmon should lose condition rapidly
on quitting the sea for the fresh water,
may be inferred from a fact agreed upon by
naturalists, that during the period of spawning
the fish neglects feeding. In this peculiar
habit the salmon is not, however, singular;
animals of the Phocæ tribe, in breeding-time,
exercise a similar abstinence. On opening a
salmon, at any season, no food will be discovered,
and the contents of the stomach will
be confined to a small quantity of yellowish
fluid and tape-worms, which are generated
there. Sir Humphry Davy believes that
occasionally food may be found. I have seen
thousands opened preparatory to being salted,
and I never observed anything but this fluid
and tape-worms. Another circumstance may
be stated as a curious proof of health, as well
as of the period of time the salmon has been
resident in a river. When the fish leaves the
sea, and of course is in its best condition, insects
(the Lernæ Salmoneæ of Linnæus) will
be perceived firmly adhering to the skin. Immediately
on entering the fresh water, these
insects begin to detach themselves from the
salmon, and after a short time they gradually
drop off and disappear.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Ireland (particularly the north) abounds
with salmon; the most considerable fishery
is at Crarma, on the river Ban, near Coleraine.
(Some account of this fishery is mentioned in
the list of the rivers, &amp;c. of this country.)
The nets used are eighteen score, or three
hundred and sixty yards long, and are continually
drawing, night and day, the whole
season (nearly four months), two sets of sixteen
men each alternately relieving one another.
The best drawing is when the tide is
coming in.</p>

<p class='c006'>The salmon are cured by being first split,
and rubbed with fine salt; and, after laying in
pickle, in great tubs or reservoirs, are packed
up with layers of coarse brown Spanish salt,
in casks, six of which make a ton. These are
exported to Leghorn and Venice.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Immediately near to Katrineberg, at a hamlet
called Deje Forsa, there is a valuable fishery
for salmon, ten or twelve thousand of these
fish being taken there annually. They are,
however, of a small size, the largest of them
rarely exceeding twenty pounds in weight;
one with another, indeed, they probably do
not average more than six or seven pounds
a-piece.</p>

<p class='c006'>These salmon are bred in the Wenern
lake, but, in consequence of the considerable
cataracts at Deje, they never have access to
the sea; from this cause, they are said to be
inferior, in point of flavour, to those found in
most other rivers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the river Beaulie, below the falls, is a
valuable salmon fishery, and in the months of
July and August many of these come to the
foot of the falls. When a flood occurs, they
endeavour to get up the stream, but as the
water in which they swim is constantly agitated
and frothy, on account of the height
from which it descends, they cannot see before
them, often mistake their direction, and leap
upon the dry rock. It is a constant practice
with the people in the neighbourhood to lay
branches of trees along the side of the water,
to prevent the fish tumbling back into the
river. Twenty salmon have by these means
been frequently taken in a morning. The
last Lord Lovat is said to have performed a
curious experiment here. He made a fire
upon the rock, and placed on it a large pot
of water; speedily a salmon, making a leap,
tumbled into the pot where it was soon boiled,
and no doubt eaten. This was done that his
lordship might be enabled to boast in the south
of the wonders that existed in the Highlands,
which were then little known, and to say that
in his country provisions abounded so much,
that if a fire was made, and a pot set to boil
on the banks of the river, the salmon would
of themselves leap into the pot to be boiled,
without requiring to be caught by a fisherman.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The fifteenth of February, 1809, Harry
Fenn, a fish-salesman at Billingsgate, sold an
uncrimped Severn salmon, weighing nineteen
pounds, for the immense sum of one guinea
per pound to Phillips, the fishmonger in Bond
Street. N.B. It was the only salmon at
market.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>La Fontaine gives an anecdote of a gourmand,
who having despatched an entire salmon
with the exception of the jowl, was taken so
ill that the physician pronounced his recovery
to be impossible. “Is it so?” said the dying
fish-fancier—the doctor gave a desponding nod—“Bring
me then the remainder of my
salmon.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Salmon Colour.</i>—Take two ounces of
annotto, tie it up in a bag, then throw it into
clean cold water, and squeeze it in the rag
often, till you melt a quantity of it down;
pour off some of this liquor into your dye-pot,
put in your stuff and boil it, and if it is pretty
red, put in some madder, a little at a time,
and if you see it is come to the colour, draw,
squeeze out the remainder, put it into your
pot, and sparingly add more madder. By using
Brazil instead of madder, you will get flesh
colour.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Salmon fishing.</i>—In salmon fishing you
must alter your manner of moving the fly. It
must not float quietly down the water; you
must allow it to sink a little, and then pull it
back by a gentle jerk, not raising it out of the
water, and then let it sink again till it has been
shown in motion, a little below the surface, in
every part of your cast.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Salmon often in this season haunt the
streams in pairs; but so far from rising again
after being pricked, they appear to me to learn
when they have been some time in the river,
that the artificial fly is not food, even without
having been touched by the hook. In the
river at Galway, in Ireland, I have seen above
the bridge some hundreds of salmon lying in
rapid streams, and from five to ten fishermen
tempting them with every variety of fly, but
in vain. After a fish had been thrown over
a few times, and risen once or twice and refused
the fly, he rarely ever took any notice
of it again in that place. It was generally
nearest the tide that fish were taken, and the
place next the sea was the most successful
stand, and the most coveted; and when the
water is low and clear in this river, the Galway
fishermen resort to the practice of fishing
with a naked hook, endeavouring to entangle
it in the bodies of the fish; a most unartist-like
practice. In spring-fishing, I have known
a hungry, half-starved salmon rise at the artificial
fly a second time, after having been very
slightly touched with it; but even this rarely
happens, and when I have seen it the water
has been coloured.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I made several unsuccessful casts—“A bad
look out, friend Julius; Heaven forefend that
the cook has placed any dependence on the
angle!” Again I tried the pool, and, like all
disappointed fishermen, began to prognosticate
a change of weather. “I had remarked mares’
tails in the sky yesterday evening, and there
was rain over head, for a hundred.” My cousin
smiled; when suddenly my nebulous speculations
were interrupted by a deep sluggish
roll at the dropper. “Monamondiaoul!” exclaimed
Mortien Beg, as he caught a momentary
glance of the broad and fan-like tail, “he
is fifteen pound weight!” Obedient to the
directions of my Mentor, I left the spot the
salmon leaped in, and commenced casting a
dozen yards below it. Gradually I came over
him again. “A light cast, Frank, and you
have him.” I tried, and succeeded gallantly.
I sent the fly across the water with the lightness
of the thistle’s down—at the same moment
the breeze eddied up the stream, and
curled the surface deliciously. A long, dull
ruffle succeeded. Whish, span the wheel:
wish-h-h-h-h, whish-h-h, whish—I have him!</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing, my dear George, can be more
beautiful than the play of a vigorous salmon.
The lubberly struggles of a pond fish are execrable
to him who has felt the exquisite pleasure
that attends the conquest of “the monarch
of the stream.” His bold rushes—his
sudden and rapid attempts to liberate himself
from the fisher’s thrall—the energy with which
he throws his silver body three or four feet
above the surface of the water, and the unwearied
and incessant opposition he makes
until his strength is exhausted by the angler’s
science. All this must be experienced, to be
adequately conceived. In ten minutes I mastered
my beautiful victim; and Mortien Beg
gaffed and landed a splendid summer fish,
which, if the cook’s scales be correct, weighed
thirteen pounds and seven ounces.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Salmon laws.</i>—The Scotch in early times
had most severe prohibitions against the killing
of the salmon. In the Regiam Majestatem are
preserved several laws relating to their fisheries,
couched in terms expressive of the simplicity
of the times. From Saturday night
until Monday morning they were obliged to
leave a free passage for the fish, which is
called the “Saterdaye’s sloppe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Alexander I. enacted “that the streame
of the water sal be in all parts swa free, that
ane swine of the age of three years, well feed,
may turn himself within the stream round
about, swa that his snowt nor taile sal not tuch
the bank of the water.” By a law of James
IV. the third offence was made capital (before
that, the offender had power to redeem his
life). “Slayers of reide fish, or smoltes of
salmond, the third time are punished with
death; and sic like he quha commands the
samine to be done.” Salmon were in the
reign of Henry VI. thought a present worthy
of a crowned head, for in that reign, the Queen
of Scotland sent to the Duchess of Clarence
ten casks of salted salmon, which Henry directed
to pass duty free.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Salmon Rod.</i>—The salmon rod is, all but
the top, made of ash, as being the lightest
wood. The structure of the trout or fly rod
has been variously recommended; the most
ancient is, the butt to be made of yellow deal,
seven feet long; next, a straight hazel, of
about six feet; and then a delicate piece of
fine-grained yew, exactly tapered, and ending
in a point of whalebone, both making about
two feet: to colour the stock, a feather dipped
in aquafortis, and rubbed into the deal, gives
it a cinnamon colour; for a nut-brown colour,
a quartern of spirit lacquer, half an ounce of
gamboge, the like quantities of gum sandarach
and dragon’s-blood (the three last to be powdered
very fine), and as much of each of them
as will lie upon a sixpence, put into the spirit
lacquer, which must be kept stirring, until
properly mixed: the phial must be warmed
as well as the wood, and the mixture gradually
laid on with a camel’s-hair brush; after
it is dried, a second and third coat is to be
applied. To make the colour redder put double
the quantity of dragon’s-blood; to make
the rod mottled, get green copperas and dissolve
in spring water; dip linen tape in the
liquid, and while wet twist it round about,
and let it remain on the rod eight or ten
hours in the cool; unbind the tape, which
will be dry, and use the above-mentioned
varnish, which will give the desired effect.
The varnish also preserves the rings and the
bindings that fix them to the rod. To fasten
a fly rod of the above make properly, a piece
of shoemaker’s wax was rubbed upon each
splice; a handle of a knife, or any hard thing,
was rubbed over them, until they were
smooth; they were then tied neatly together,
and were as firm as any part of the rod.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following comparison is made by Sir
Humphry Davy, between trout and salmon:—The
salmon is broader, has a tail rather more
forked, and teeth in proportion are rather
smaller. The trout, likewise, has larger and
more black-brown spots on the body; and
the head of the trout is a little larger in proportion.
The salmon has fourteen spines in
the pectoral fins, ten in each of the ventral,
thirteen in the anal, twenty-one in the caudal,
and fifteen in the dorsal. The salmon measures
thirty-eight inches and a half in length,
and twenty-one inches in girth; and his
weight, as you see, is twenty-two pounds and
a quarter. The trout has one spine less in
the pectoral, and two less in the anal fin, and
measures thirty inches and a quarter in
length, and sixteen inches in girth, and his
weight is eleven pounds. When opened, the
stomach of the salmon contains nothing but a
little yellow fluid, and, though the salmon is
twice as large, does not exceed much in size
that of the trout. The stomach of the trout,
unlike that of the salmon, will be found full
of food.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Wild Sports</i>—<i>Lloyd</i>—<i>Davy, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The salmon trout is handsome in its
form, is more richly adorned, and is longer,
thicker, rounder in proportion than a salmon;
the scales are small, beautifully intermixed
on both sides of the lateral line, and also
the covers of the gills, with spots; the fins
are strong, and the tail shorter, but not
so much forked as the salmon’s; the flesh
is exceedingly rich, and in some countries
better esteemed than any fish of the salmon
kind; they are generally from two to six
pounds weight, some run larger; they are often
taken when angling for salmon or large trout,
their haunts being the same. Early in the
spring they enter the rivers, are in prime season
from the end of April until July, and
spawn chiefly in September; but that period
varies in different waters; the rod should be
as for salmon, the reel line strong, and foot
length about three yards of fine twisted silkworm
gut, or the strongest single, with the
knots well whipped.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The last dietetic, or rather, perhaps, medicinal
article necessary to be described, is the
saltcat, so called from an old fancy of baking
a real cat with spices for the use of pigeons,
which, however, I never observed to eat animal
food. In compliance with this custom, I
caused to be placed in the middle of the pigeon
loft a dish of the following composition:—Loam,
sand, old mortar, fresh lime, bay-salt,
cummin, coriander, caraway seed, and allspice,
moistened into a consistence with urine. The
pigeons were constantly pecking at this, and
were in a constant state of good health; how
much of which may be attributed to the use
of the cat I cannot determine; but certainly
they are extremely fond of it, and if it have no
other merit, it prevents them from pecking the
mortar from the roof of the house, to which
otherwise they are much inclined. The cat
was mixed and heaped up in the dish, a piece
of board being placed upon the summit to
prevent the birds from dunging upon it; when
become too hard it was occasionally broken
for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The regular old formula for this cat is as
follows: gravel or drift-sand, unctuous loam,
the rubbish of an old wall, or lime, a gallon
of each—should lime be substituted for rubbish,
a less quantity of the former will suffice—one
pound of cummin-seed, one handful of
bay-salt; mix with stale urine. Inclose this
in jars, corked or stopped, holes being punched
in the sides, to admit the beaks of the pigeons.

<p class='c006'>This is an accident that happens to dry
brittle hoofs, and is in fact a breaking or fracture
of the horn in the weakest part, that is,
at the upper part of the inner quarter. A
sandcrack almost always extends to the sensible
parts, and can seldom be cured if the
horse is kept in work. The first thing to be
done is to open the crack with a drawing
knife, for it generally runs obliquely under
the horn, and cut out every hollow part completely,
however far it may extend under the
crust. Every particle of horn that is hollow
or detached from the sensible parts must be
completely cut away; some tar ointment
should then be applied, or at first a solution
of blue vitriol. If there is much lameness
or inflammation in the foot, it should be poulticed
for several days or a week, and then the
horse should be turned to grass without shoes,
or with a bar shoe, for three weeks at least,
or until an inch of new hoof appears above
the crack. A little blister ointment just
above the crack often does good, and tar ointment
on the crack and adjacent horn. Observe,
too, that the quarter where the crack is
must be rasped away as thin as possible. In
this way sandcracks may be always cured
without difficulty. The brittle state of the
hoof, however, must be corrected when the
horse returns from grass, by paring the soles
rather thin, applying a wide hollow shoe, and
keeping the foot stopped, not with cow-dung
or clay, as has been advised, but with the tar
ointment; this will be absorbed through the
horn, stimulate the secreting vessels, and
cause a plentiful effusion of that odorous vapour
which is constantly escaping from the
bottom of the foot. The vessels being thus
unloaded, the temperature of the foot will be
reduced, and the secretion of horn will be at
the same time so increased, that the horse
will soon be able to go with a narrower shoe.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This bird weighs almost two ounces, is
about eight inches in length, and fifteen in
breadth from tip to tip. The bill is an inch
long, slender, black, and grooved on the sides
nearly from the tip to the nostril; the brow,
to the eyes, white; the rest of the head, pale
ash-colour, mottled in brown streaks from the
forehead to the hinder part of the neck, and
on each side of the upper part of the breast;
back scapulars and greater coverts brownish
ash, edged with dull white, and irregularly
marked with dark brown spots. The pinions,
lesser coverts, and bastard wings, dark brown;
the quills, which extend beyond the tail, are
of the same colour on the exterior webs and
points, except four of the middle ones, which
are white on the outer webs, forming, when
the wing is closed, a sharp wedge-shaped spot;
the inner webs brownish ash; the secondary
quills brown, tipped with white; the rump
and tail coverts are also brown, edged with
dirty white; the tail feathers brownish ash
edged with a lighter colour—the two middle
ones much darker than the rest; the throat,
fore part of the neck, breast, belly, thighs,
and vent, are white; the toes and legs black,
and bare a little above the knees. This bird
is of a slender form, and the plumage has a
hoary appearance among the stints, with which
it associates on the sea shore in various parts
of Great Britain. It wants the hinder toe,
and has, in other respects, the look of the
plover and dotterell, to which family it
belongs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Latham says, this bird, like the purre, and
some others, varies considerably, either from
age or the season; for those he received in
August had the upper parts dark ash-coloured,
and the feathers deeply edged with ferruginous
colour; but others sent to him in January
were of a plain dove-coloured grey. They
differ also in some other trifling particulars.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_465.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The tongue of the sandpiper is slender;
toes divided, or very slightly connected at the
base by a membrane; hinder toe weak; their
bills are nearly of the same form as those of
the preceding species, but shorter: their
haunts and manner of life are also very similar.
Latham has enumerated thirty-seven
species and nine varieties of this genus, seventeen
of which are British, exclusive of
those which, in this work, are placed among
the plovers; but the history and classifications
of this genus are involved in much uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Common Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa hypoleucus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>La Guignette</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This
bird weighs about two ounces, and measures
seven inches and a half in length. The bill
is about an inch long, black at the tip, fading
into pale-brown towards the base. The head,
and hinder part of the neck, are brownish-ash,
streaked downwards with dark narrow
lines: the throat is white, and a streak of the
same colour surrounds and is extended over
each eye; the cheeks and auriculars are
streaked with brown; the forepart of the
neck, to the breast, is white, mottled and
streaked with spots and lines of a brown colour,
pointing downwards; in some the breast
is plain white; belly and vent white. The
ground-colour of all the upper parts of the
plumage is ash, blended with glossy olive
bronze; the coverts, scapulars, lower part of
the back, and tail-coverts, are edged with dull
white, and most elegantly marked with transverse
dark-coloured narrow, waved lines; the
first two quills are plain brown; the next
nine are marked on the middle of their inner
webs, with white spots; the secondaries are
also marked in the same manner, on both
webs, and tipped with white. The tail consists
of twelve feathers; the four middle ones
are of an olive brown, dark at the tips; those
next to them, on each side, are much lighter
coloured, mottled with dark-brown and tipped
with white; the two outside ones are edged
and tipped in the same manner, but are barred
on their webs with dark-brown; legs pale dull-green,
faintly blushed with red.</p>

<p class='c006'>This elegant little bird breeds in this country,
but the species is not numerous; yet they
are frequently seen in pairs during the summer
months; and are well known by their
clear piping note, by their flight, by jerking
up their tails, and by their manner of running
after their insect prey on the pebbly margins
of brooks and rivers. The female makes her
nest in a hole on the ground near their haunts;
her eggs, commonly five in number, are
much mottled and marked with dark spots,
on a yellowish ground. They leave England
in the autumn; but whither they go is not
particularly noticed by ornithologists. Buffon
says they retire far north; and Pennant and
Latham, that they are met with in Siberia
and Kamtschatka, and are also not uncommon
in North America.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Brown Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Fusca.</i>)—Pennant
describes this bird, which, he says, was bought
in a London market, and preserved in the collection
of the late M. Tunstall, Esq., of

black; the head, upper part of the neck, and
back, are of a pale-brown, spotted with black;
coverts of the wings dusky, edged with dirty
white; under side of the neck white, streaked
with black; the belly white; tail cinereous:
legs black.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Greenwich Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Greenovicensis.</i>)—Size

nape, cheeks, and neck, ash-colour; the middle
of the feathers dusky, down the shaft;
lower part of the neck and back, black; the
feathers margined on the sides with pale ferruginous,
and some of those of the back at
the tips also; chin nearly white; forepart of
the neck very pale ash-colour, as far as the
breast, which is a dusky white; belly, sides,
vent, and upper tail-coverts on each side, and
the whole of the under ones, white; lesser
wing-coverts ash-colour; the greater, the same,
obscurely margined with pale ferruginous;
greatest tipped with white; under wing coverts
pure white; prime quills dusky, the
shafts more or less white; secondaries and
scapulars nearly the colour of the back; the
secondaries and primaries very little differing
in length; the lower part of the back, rump,
and middle of the tail-coverts, ash-colour;
tail a little rounded at the end, brownish ash-colour,
somewhat mottled with brownish near
the tips, and fringed near to the end with
pale ferruginous; legs dusky olive-green, bare
an inch above the knee; the outer and middle
toe connected at the base.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Black Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa cinerea.</i>)—Size
of a thrush; the beak short, blunt at the
point, and dusky; nostrils black; the irides
yellow: the head small, and flattened at the
top; the colour white, most elegantly spotted
with grey; the neck, shoulders, and back,
mottled in the same manner, but darker,
being tinged with brown; in some lights these
parts appeared of a perfect black, and glossy;
the wings were long; the quill feathers black,
crossed near the base with a white line; the
throat, breast, and belly white, with faint
brown and black spots of a longish form, irregularly
disposed, but on the belly become
larger and more round; the tail short, entirely
white, except the two middle feathers,

extended over each eye, and a brownish patch
between them and the bill; the whole upper
part of the plumage is of a glossy lightish
brown, with green reflections; the head and
neck are marked with longish small dark
spots; on the back, scapulars, and wing coverts,
the spots are larger, and of a triangular
shape; the rump is plain; the greater quills
are dusky; secondaries tipped with white, as
are also the greater and lesser coverts, which
form two white oblique lines across the extended
wings; the two middle feathers of the tail
are greenish brown; the sides ones white,
crossed with dusky lines; the breast, belly,
and vent, are white, but in the female spotted
with brown; legs of a dirty flesh colour.
This species is not common in England.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red-legged, Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa erythropus.</i>)—This
bird measures from the tip of
the beak to the end of the tail ten inches;
the bill is an inch and three-eighths long,
black at the tip, and reddish towards the base;
the crown of the head is spotted with dark
brown, disposed in streaks, and edged with
pale brown and grey; a darkish patch covers
the space between the corners of the mouth
and eyes; the chin is white; the brow and
cheeks pale brown, prettily freckled with
small dark spots; the hinder part of the neck
is composed of a mixture of pale brown, grey,
and ash, with a few distinct dusky spots; the
forepart and breast are white, clouded with a
dull cinnamon colour, and sparingly and irregularly
marked with black spots, reflecting a
purple gloss; the shoulder and scapular feathers
are black, edged with pale rust colour,
and have the same glossy reflections as those
on the breast; the tertials are nearly the same
length as the quills; the ridges of the wings
are a brownish ash colour; the coverts, back,
and rump, are nearly the same, but inclining
to olive, and the middle of each feather is of
a deeper dusky brown; the primary quills are
deep olive brown; the exterior webs of the
secondaries are also of that colour, but lighter,
edged and tipped with white, and the inner
webs are mostly white towards the base; the
tail coverts are glossy black, edged with pale
rust colour, and tipped with white, but in
some of them a streak of white passes from
the middle upwards nearly the whole length.
The tail feathers are lightish brown, except
the two middle ones, which are barred with
spots of a darker hue; the belly and vent are
white; legs bare above the knees, and red as
sealing-wax; claws black. The female is less
than the male, and her plumage more dingy
and indistinct; an egg taken out of her previous
to stuffing was surprisingly large considering
her bulk, being about the size of that
of a magpie, of a greenish white colour, spotted
and blotched with brown, of a long shape,
and pointed at the smaller end. This bird
is a constant inhabitant of the fens, and is
known to sportsmen by its singular notes,
which are very loud and melodious, and are
heard even when the bird is beyond the reach
of sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The description of this bird, which, it seems,
is common in the fen countries, has been more
particularly attended to, because it has not been
described in any of the popular works on ornithology;
at least not so accurately as to enable
a naturalist to distinguish it by the proper name.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Red Sandpiper</i>, <i>Aberdeen Sandpiper</i>.
(<i>Tringa Icelandica</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—Latham describes
this bird in the following manner:—Length
from eight to ten inches; bill brown,
one inch and a half long, and a little bent
downwards; head, hinder part of the neck, and
beginning of the back, dusky, marked with red;
forepart of the neck and breast cinereous, and
mixed with rust colour, and obscurely spotted
with black; lesser wing coverts cinereous; quills
dusky; secondaries tipped with white; the
two middle tail feathers dusky; the other cinereous;
legs long and black.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ash-coloured Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa Cinerea</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—This bird weighs between four
and five ounces, and measures ten inches in
length, and about nineteen in breadth. The
whole upper parts of the plumage are of a
brownish ash-colour: the head is spotted, and
the neck streaked with dusky lines: the feathers
of the back, scapulars, and wing coverts,
are elegantly marked or bordered on their
ridges and tips, with two narrow lines of dull
white, and dark brown. Some specimens have
black spots on the breast, but most commonly
the whole under parts are pure white; the tail
is cinereous, edged with white, and its coverts
are barred with black; legs dirty green; toes
edged with a fine narrow scalloped membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ash-coloured sandpiper, it is said, breeds
in the northern parts of both Europe and America.
Pennant says they appear in vast flocks
on the shores of Flintshire in the winter season;
and Latham, that they are seen in vast
numbers on the Seal Islands, near Chateau
Bay; and also that they breed and remain the
whole summer at Hudson’s Bay, where they are
called by the natives sasqua pisqua nishish.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Shore Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa Littorea</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Chevalier Variée</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Under
this name Latham describes this bird, which
it is said migrates from Sweden into England
at the approach of winter. He makes it a variety
of the last species, and says it does not
differ materially from it. “The spots on the
back are ferruginous instead of white: the shaft
of the first quill is white, as in the green sandpiper;
and the secondaries have white tips:
the legs are brown.” Brunnich mentions a
further variety, wherein the first quill has a
black shaft, and the spots on the back and
wings are less; and observes, that they differ
in age and sex.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Green Sandpiper.</i> (<i>Tringa Ochropus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Becasseau, ou Cul-blanc</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This
bird measures about ten inches in length,
to the end of the toes nearly twelve, and weighs
about three ounces and a half: the bill is black,
and an inch and a half long: a pale streak extends
from it over each eye; between which
and the corners of the mouth; there is a dusky
patch. The crown of the head and hinder part
of the neck are of a dingy brownish ash-colour,
in some specimens narrowly streaked with
white; the throat white; fore part of the neck
mottled or streaked with brown spots, on a
white or pale ash-coloured ground. The whole
upper parts of the plumage are of a glossy
bronze, or olive brown, elegantly marked on
the edge of each feather with small roundish
white spots; the quills are without spots, and
are of a darker brown; the secondaries and
tertials are very long; the inside of the wings
are dusky, edged with white grey; and the inside
coverts next the body are curiously barred,
from the shaft of each feather to their edges,
with narrow white lines, formed nearly of the
shape of two sides of a triangle. The belly,
vent, tail coverts, and tail, are white; the last
broadly barred with black, the middle feathers
having four bars, and those next to them decreasing
in the number of bars towards the outside
feathers, which are quite plain: the legs
are green.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is not any where numerous, and
is of a solitary disposition, seldom more than a
pair being seen together, and that chiefly in the
breeding season. It is a scarce bird in England,
but is said to be more common in the northern
parts of the globe as far as Iceland. It is reported
that they never frequent the sea shores, but
their places of abode are commonly on the
margins of the lakes in the interior and mountainous
parts of the country.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Latham.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This species is about the size of a widgeon,
length twenty-two inches, including the long
feathers of the tail; the bill is black; down
the middle and across the tip, orange; irides
red; the fore part and sides of the head are
reddish grey; on each side of the neck, just
below the head, is an oval black spot; the
hind part of the head, the throat, and remaining
part of the neck and breast, white; back
and rump black; sides of the upper tail
coverts white, the middle black; the lower
belly and vent white; the scapulars white
long, and pointed; the wings chiefly black,
with a mixture of chestnut; the four middle
tail feathers are black, the others white; the
two middle ones are narrow, and exceed the
others three inches and a half; legs of a dull
red; claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the description of the male; but in
some the black spots are more or less of a
chocolate colour, and the spot on the neck
occupies half of it. The length of the tail
also varies.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female has been described by some
authors for a different species. The bill, however,
which is the same in this sex, seems to
be an unerring guide. The sides of the head
are white, behind cinereous; the rest of the
head, the neck, breast, and back, dusky black;
the lower part of the breast and scapulars
chestnut; belly white; upper tail coverts and
wings like the male; legs dusky reddish
brown. This sex is also subject to some
variation; most commonly, the middle tail-feathers
are not much longer than the rest.
It is seldom met with in England, but is frequent
in the north of Scotland and the Orkneys
in winter, where they assemble in large
flocks; it is common in Sweden, Lapland,
and Russia, and is said to breed in Greenland
and at Hudson’s Bay, where it makes a nest
of grass near the sea, and lays ten or more
bluish-white eggs. The down of this bird is
said to be as valuable as that of the eider
duck.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The length of this species is about twenty-one
inches; weight sometimes as much as
thirty-five ounces; the bill is broad, and not
so much compressed as usual in this genus;
colour bluish-lead; nail black; irides light
gold-colour; the head and upper part of the
neck black, glossed with green, and, from
being well clothed with feathers, appears large;
the lower part of the neck and breast black;
back and scapulars pale grey, undulated with
innumerable small transverse lines of black;
the wing coverts the same, but minutely
small; lower part of the back, rump, and
vent, black; the primores are dusky, lightest
on their inner webs, and black at the ends;
the secondary quills, except a few next the
body, are white tipped with black, forming a
broad bar of white across the wing; the under
part of the body is white, sprinkled between
the thighs with dusky; the tail is composed
of dusky-black feathers; legs lead-colour.
In some we have seen, the white in the wing
is edged with rust-colour: it is also subject
to other varieties.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scaup duck is not uncommon in most
parts of this kingdom in winter, and is frequently
found in fresh waters. It is supposed
to take its name from feeding on broken shells
called scaup. This, like most of the genus,
breeds in the more northern parts; is common
in Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Lapland;
and is found at Hudson’s Bay, in the
warmer months.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Scent</span>, <i>s.</i> The power of smelling; the smell; the object of smell; chace
followed by the smell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scent cannot be ascertained by the air only,
it depends also on the soil. Doubtless, the
scent most favourable to the hound, is when
the effluvia constantly perspiring from the
game as it runs, is kept by the gravity of the
air to the height of his breast; for then it is
neither above his reach, nor need he stoop for
it: this is what is meant when scent is said
to be breast high. Experience tells us that
difference of soil alters the scent. When the
leaves begin to fall, and before they are rotted,
scent lies ill in cover—a sufficient proof that
it does not depend on the air only. Scent
also varies by difference of motion; the faster
the animal goes the less scent it leaves.
When game has been ridden after, and hurried
on by imprudent sportsmen, hounds will
with difficulty pick out the scent; and one
reason may be, that the particles of scent are
then more dissipated: but if the game should
have been run by a dog not belonging to the
pack, very seldom will any scent remain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scent frequently alters in the same day;
and without asserting what scent exactly is,
it may be said to depend chiefly on two
things—the condition of the ground, and the
temperature of the air, which should be moist
without being wet. When both are in this
state, the scent is then perfect; and <i>vice versa</i>,
when the ground is hard and the air dry, there
seldom will be any scent. It scarce ever lies
with a north or an east wind; a southerly
wind without rain, and a westerly one that is
not rough, are the best. Storms in the air
seldom fail to destroy scent. A fine sunshiny
day is not good for hunting; but a day warm
without sun, is generally a perfect one: there
are not many such in a whole season. In
some fogs scent lies high, in others not at all,
depending, probably, on the quarter the wind
is then in. It sometimes lies very high in a
mist, when not too wet; but if the wet continues
to hang upon the boughs and bushes,
it will fall upon the scent and deaden it.
When the dogs roll, and also when cobwebs
hang on the bushes, there is seldom much
scent. During a white frost, the scent lies
high, as it also does when the frost is quite
gone; at the time of its going off (which is a
critical minute for hounds, in which their
game is frequently lost), scent never lies. In
a hard rain, with the air mild, scent will sometimes
be very good. A wet night often produces
the best chases, game not then liking
to run the cover or the roads. In heathy
countries, where the game brushes as it goes
along, scent seldom fails; yet, from the inclosures
of poor land surrounding them, the
scent is, at times, very difficult for hounds;
the sudden change from a good to a bad scent
confuses their noses; a scent therefore which
is less good, but less unequal, is more favourable
to hounds. When the ground carries
the scent is bad for an obvious reason, which
hare-hunters who pursue their game over
greasy fallows and dirty roads have great
cause to complain of. A remark has been
generally made, that scent lies best in the
richest soils, and those countries which are
favourable to horses are not so to hounds;
and it has likewise been observed in some
particular spots in almost every country, let
the temperature of the air be as it may, that
hounds can never carry a scent across them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morning is the part of the day which
usually affords the best scent, and the animal
itself, which you are at this time more than
ever desirous of killing, is then least able to
escape; the want of rest, added perhaps to a
full belly, give hounds a decided superiority
over an early found fox.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Schooners, within the last twenty years,
have gradually come into general use, and
have, in a great degree, superseded the smaller
sized brigs and large sloops which were formerly
employed as coasters. They are found
more manageable and weatherly, and in sailing
qualities infinitely superior to either.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Americans are celebrated for the size
of their schooners, and the beauty of their
mould. In the late war, numbers of these
vessels were fitted out as privateers; and from
their extraordinary sailing properties, their
success was unexampled.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Royal Yacht Club there are a good
number of vessels of this class; but the cutter
rig appears to be the favourite.</p>

legs of mean length, slender, the naked space
above the knee very small; three toes before
entirely divided, the middle and the outer
ones rarely united; one toe behind; wings of
mean length, the first quill of equal length,
or a little shorter than the second, which is
the longest in the wing.</p>

<p class='c006'>This division of the numerous scolopax genus
of Linnæus amounts, according to Latham, to
about twenty species, besides varieties, of which
only the woodcock, common snipe, and judcock,
and their varieties, are accounted British
birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pennant has placed the woodcock after the
curlews, as the head of the godwits and snipes;
and others are of opinion that the knot, from
the similarity of its figure to that of the woodcock,
ought to be classed in this tribe. In the
subdivisions, ornithologists may vary their
classification without end. As in a chain
doubly suspended, the rings of which gradually
diminish towards the middle, the leading features
of some particular bird may point it out
as a head to a tribe; others, from similarity
of shape, plumage, or habits, will form, by almost
imperceptible variations, the connecting
links; and those which may be said to compose
the curvature of the bottom, by gradations
equally minute, will rise to the last ring
of the other end, which, as the head of another
tribe, will be marked with characters very
different from the first.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

if there be a dark sky it is all the better. In

dash, he will follow the bait to the stern of the
boat, and I have often hooked them within a
fathom of the rudder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four or five knots an hour, is the best rate
of sailing for killing coal-fish, and upon a coast
where they are abundant, the sport, at times,
is excellent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Like the pike the coal-fish is very indifferent
to the tackle used, which is generally very
coarse. Not so the mackerel; he requires
much delicacy of line and bait to induce him
to take.</p>

<p class='c006'>In light winds, or when the fish are out of
humour, I have killed mackerel by substituting
a salmon casting line of single gut, for the
hempen snoud commonly employed by fishermen,
which with a newly-cut bait of phosphoric
brilliancy, commonly overcame his resolve
against temptation. But there are times when
a change of weather, or some inexplicable phenomena
of sea or sky, render these fish dull
and cautious—for usually it requires but trifling
art to kill them.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little experience is necessary. The bait
must be cut from the freshest mackerel, and
assimilated in size and shape to the herring-fry,
which they generally follow—and the way
of the boat must be so regulated, as to preserve
the deception by a sufficient velocity,
without breaking by its rapidity the mackerel’s
hold. The mouth of this fish is particularly
tender—and if care be not taken many will
drop from the hook before they can be secured
on board.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Seafowl</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird that lives at sea.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Shooting Seafowl.</i>—To venture after fowl
at sea you must have a large boat with good
bearings, that will carry plenty of canvass.
Rowing after them scarcely ever answers; but
when it blows fresh a fast sailing boat may
often run in upon geese, and sometimes other
birds, before they can take wing; and after a
coast has been for some time harassed by the
gunning punts, I have seen more birds killed
under sail from a common boat, than by any
other manner of day shooting. But, to do the
business well, a stanchion gun must be fixed
in the boat, and this, by all means, contrived
so as to go back with the recoil, or you run
the risk of staving your boat, and therefore
of being really in danger. Recollect when you
get on the outside of the harbour an accident
is no joke; and you have, as Dr. Johnson observes,
but one plank between you and eternity.</p>

<p class='c006'>A boat for this work should have plenty
of bearings, and have as little keel as she can
well go to windward with, in order to get, at
times, within shot of the mud and sands, and
also to run through a harbour at spring tides
without getting aground. You should therefore,
for this sport, always make choice of a
day when the wind is off the land, and a time
when the tide is flowing; as you have then no
danger of filling your boat with the hollow
sea of a lee shore, or running her so fast aground
as not to be able to get her off immediately.
In following wild fowl under sail, command,
as much as you can, a windward berth, in
order to bear down on them at pleasure;
and if they rise out of shot against wind, as
they usually do, luff up directly, and try to
head them for a cross shot. As the gun,
when on one tack, is in the way of the jib,
you must have the man who attends the jib-sheets
always in readiness to haul the weather
one to windward; but this must be done only
just before you want to fire, or you deaden
the boat’s way. Take care also to let the
sheet be under the barrel of the gun, in order
that your line of aim may be clear of every
thing. In this pursuit, when the more wind
sometimes the more sport, never go with less
than three good hands; and be careful in
squally weather not to make too fast the
mainsheet, as nine-tenths of the misfortunes
that we hear of, have occurred from this very
circumstance.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Seals are very numerous on the coast, and
at this season a number may be seen any
warm day you make an excursion up the
Sound of Achil. We shoot them occasionally;
the skin makes a waterproof covering,
and the fat affords an excellent oil for many
domestic purposes. It is difficult, however, to
secure the animal, for numbers are shot and
few gotten. The head is the only place to
strike them, for even when mortally wounded
in the body, they generally manage to escape.
This fact we have ascertained, from finding
them dead on shore many days after they
were wounded, and at a considerable distance
from the place where they had received the
bullet. I shot one last autumn at the mouth
of the river, and a fortnight afterwards he
was taken up in the neighbourhood of Dhuhill.
There could be no doubt as to the
identity of the creature, for on opening him
to extract the oil, a rifle-ball, such as I use,
of the unusually small size of fifty-four to
the pound, was found lodged in his lungs.
Unless when killed outright, they sink instantly;
and I have seen the sea dyed with
blood to an extent that proved how severely
the seal had been wounded, but never could
trace him farther.</p>

<p class='c006'>Formerly, when seal-oil and skins were of
value, some persons on the coast made the
pursuit of the animal a profession. There is
one of these persons living near the Sound, a
miserable, dwarfish, red-bearded wretch, whom
you would consider hardly equal to grapple
with a salmon, and yet he secures more seals
than any hunter in the district. His method
of effecting it is singular; he uses neither
gun nor spear, but kills the animal with
a short bludgeon, loaded at the end with lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Adjacent to the seal-killer’s residence
there is a large rock, uncovered at half-tide,
and this appears the most favourite haunt for
the animal to bask upon. The rock is easily
approached from the main land, and on a
sunny day, when the wind favours the attempt,
the hunter, undressed, and armed with
his bludgeon, silently winds among the stones,
and steals upon his sleeping prey. Wary as
the creature is, the Red Dwarf seldom fails
in surprising him, and with astonishing expertness
generally despatches him with a single
blow.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Old English Setter.</i> (<i>Canis Index,
variety α.</i>)—This breed was originally produced
between the Spanish pointer and the
large water spaniel, and was famous on account
of his steadiness and exquisite sense of smelling;
the hair over the whole body was much
more curled than that of the present breed,
which has been considerably lightened by the
additional cross of the springer; he was also
much more steady than the improved variety,
but then he had not the same speed to recommend
him. Fine dogs of this kind were also
produced by a cross with the stag and blood
hounds. They united great strength, considerable
swiftness, and were used for the chace in
some few instances.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The English Setter</i> (<i>Canis Index, variety β</i>),
is a breed produced between the
Spanish pointer, the English water spaniel
and springer, which, by careful cultivation,
has attained a high degree of perfection as a
sporting dog. He has an elegant figure, and
a very pleasing diversity of colour; added to
this, his skin is covered with beautifully curled
hair, very villous on the lower margin of the
tail; being altogether an extremely handsome
dog, and quite unrivalled by any of the canine
species.</p>

<p class='c006'>The setter has all the excellent qualities
of the pointer, with a greater degree of speed
and natural vivacity of temper; he, however,
is not so easily broken in as the pointer, and
requires a certain degree of training every
year, to make him continue staunch. There
are, however, various instances of setters being
self-taught, as the following example will
show:—The black and tan small setter
bitch which I have (says Mr. Torry), was
originally out of the Duke of Bedford’s breed,
and both she and her mother inherit the utmost
natural sagacity as sporting dogs. At
ten months old, and before she had got a lesson
in breaking, or had seen game killed, she
was taken to the moors for the first time, and
on finding a bird, was perfectly steady at her
point, backed, and did not run the game.
The gentleman who was with me wounded a
bird, and it fell at a considerable distance.
The pup, unknown to us, had kept her eye
upon it, and, to our astonishment, after we
had loaded, and again ordered our dogs to
range, she went direct to the spot where the
bird fell, found and fetched it to my friend’s
feet. This happened in August, 1825.</p>

<p class='c006'>The setter ranges with great speed, and is a
very hardy dog. Many prefer him to the pointer,
and if water is plentiful, he is certainly more
useful, for his feet are much better defended
against the sharp cutting of the heath than
those of the pointer, as he has a great deal of hair
growing between the toes and round the ball
of the foot, of which the latter is almost destitute.
Besides, he unquestionably ranges
much faster, and can endure much more
fatigue. He can also serve in thick coverts,
where a pointer will not enter; and, on this
account, is useful in woodcock shooting, where
springers or cockers are not kept.</p>

<p class='c006'>Formerly the setter was used for the purpose
of taking partridges with a draw-net, and
was generally taught to squat down when the
game was within a proper distance—hence
the name setter. They are now, however,
trained to point in the same manner as the
spaniel. It is said that Robert Dudley, Duke
of Northumberland, was the first person who
broke a setter to the net.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There is not a country in Europe that can
boast of finer setters than Ireland; they are
there called English spaniels, and differ widely
from the setters of England and Scotland.
They are not esteemed in Ireland unless their
colour be either a deep chestnut and white,
or all red; a black and white setter, or any
colour but red, or red and white, would not
be looked upon or reputed well bred, allowing
them to be ever so good. It matters not
whether they are all red, or red and white;
but those esteemed most have a black nose,
and a black roof to their mouth,—as most
sportsmen conceive the black nose to be finer
and superior to any other. Sir William Barker,
Mr. Oliver of Castle Oliver, Mr. Macarthy
of Spring House, and many other gentlemen
in Ireland, have the most beautiful
and steady of this kind. A circumstance
occurred, with respect to the steadiness and
discipline of some of this breed, which the
compiler was an eye-witness to:—Colonel
Macdonald being on a visit at Mr. Oliver’s,
during the grousing season, and going out one
day, took out with him five brace of setters;
on getting to the mountains, one of the dogs
found some birds, all the rest backed in at once,
upon which Colonel Macdonald called to the
last dog to take the lead, and in that manner
he drew the dogs alternately, until the last
became first, and fixed the birds, which had
run nearly a mile. These dogs in general
fetch a long price; Mr. Macarthy got two
hundred guineas for a brace of them, and a
gentleman in the north of Ireland was known
once to have given, for a dog and bitch of this
sort, to his tenant, the renewal of a lease of a
farm for nine hundred and ninety-nine years,
which if this lease had expired, would have
cleared to the landlord above two hundred
and fifty pounds a year. The compiler himself
sold a brace of setters, in the year 1801,
for two hundred guineas, to a Captain Baggot.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Thornhill.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The form, the aspect altogether, the outward
conformation of all the parts, the character,
manners, and habits, and places of
abode, of this species, are nearly like those of
the cormorant; but they do not associate,
and these make their nests on the rugged,
shelvy sides and crevices of the rocky precipices
or projecting cliffs which overhang the
sea, while the others make theirs on the summits
above them; and these are at once distinguished
from the others by the greenness
of the upper, and brownness of the under
plumage, and also in being of a much less
size—the largest shags weighing only about
four pounds, and measuring nearly two feet
six inches in length, and three feet eight in
breadth. The bill is of a more slender make,
but nearly as long as that of the cormorant;
the head, in the male, is crested in the same
manner; the middle claw is serrated; and
its tail, consisting of twelve stiff feathers
stained with green, is also of the same form
and hoary or dirty appearance as that of the
cormorant; the crown of the head, hinder
part of the neck, lower back, and rump, are
of a plain black, or very dark green, shining
like satin; the upper back, or shoulders,
together with the scapulars and wings, are
nearly of the same colour, but with a tinge of
bronze brown, and each feather is distinctly
edged with purple glossed black; the under
parts are clouded with dusky dirty white, and
brown.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>“I have a fine pointer,” said a gentleman
to his friend, “staunch as can be at birds, but
I cannot break him from sheep.” His reply
was, that the best way would be to couple
him to the horns of an old ram, and leave
him in a stable all night, and the discipline
he would receive would prevent his loving
field-mutton again. The same person meeting
the owner of the dog some time afterwards,
accosted him thus: “Well, sir, your
pointer is now the best in England, no doubt,
from my prescription.” “Much the same,
sir, for he killed my ram, and ate a shoulder!”—<i>Sporting

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The male of this prettily marked species is
somewhat larger than the mallard, measuring
about two feet in length, three and a half in
breadth, and weighing, commonly, two pounds
ten ounces. The bill is red, with the nail
and nostrils black; the upper mandible is
broad, flat, and grooved on the edges towards
the point, where it has rather a cast upwards;
it is also depressed in the middle, and raised
into a knob or tubercle at the base. The
head and upper part of the neck are of a
glossy dark or bottle green; the lower part
of the neck, to the breast, is encircled with
white, and joined by a broad band of bright
orange bay, which is spread over, and covers
the breast and shoulders. The back, wing-coverts,
rump, upper tail-coverts, and sides of
the belly, to the vent and tail, are white; a
dusky stripe, tinged with rufous, runs along
the middle from the breast, the whole length
of the belly; part of the scapulars next the
wings are black, and those next the body
white; the bastard wing, and some of the first
primary quills, are black; the exterior webs
of the next adjoining ones are glossed with
gold green, which forms the speculum or
beauty-spot of the wings; this spot is bounded
and partly covered by the orange webs of the
three succeeding quill-feathers, which separate
it from the scapulars. The tail is white,
but some of its feathers are tipped with
black; the legs pale red.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female is less than the male, and her
plumage is not so vivid and beautiful. She
makes her nest, and rears her young, underground,
in the rabbit-holes which are made in
the sand-hills near the sea shore: it is chiefly
formed of the fine down plucked from her
own breast: she lays from twelve to sixteen
roundish white eggs, and the incubation lasts
about thirty days. During this time, the
male, who is very attentive to his charge,
keeps watch in the day-time, on some adjoining
hillock, where he can see all around him,
and which he quits only when impelled by
hunger, to procure subsistence. The female
also leaves the nest, for the same purpose, in
the mornings and evenings, at which times
the male takes his turn, and supplies her
place. As soon as the young are hatched, or
are able to waddle along, they are conducted,
and sometimes carried in the bill, by the
parents, to the full tide, upon which they
launch without fear, and are not seen afterwards
out of tide-mark until they are well
able to fly; lulled by the roaring of the flood,
they find themselves at home amidst an ample
store of their natural food, which consists
of sand-hoppers, sea-worms, &amp;c. or small
shell-fish, and the innumerable shoals of the
little fry which have not yet ventured out
into the great deep, but are left on the beach,
or tossed to the surface of the water by the
restless surge.</p>

<p class='c006'>If this family in their progress from the
nest to the sea, happen to be interrupted by
any person, the young ones, it is said, seek
the first shelter, and squat close down, and
the parent birds fly off; then commences that
truly curious scene dictated by an instinct
analogous to reason, the same as has been already
noticed in the mallard and the partridge;
the tender mother drops at no great distance
from her helpless brood, trails herself along
the ground, flaps it with her wings, and appears
to struggle as if she were wounded, in
order to attract attention, and tempt a pursuit
after her. Should these wily schemes, in
which she is also aided by her mate, succeed,
they both return when the danger is over, to
their terrified motionless little offspring, to renew
the tender offices of cherishing and protecting
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are sometimes watched to their
holes, which are dug up to the nest, whence
the eggs are taken and hatched, and the young
reared by a tame duck.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this way many gentlemen, tempted by
the richness of their garb, have their ponds
stocked with these beautiful birds; but as
they are of a roving disposition, and are apt to
stray, or to quit altogether such limited spots,
it is generally found necessary to pinion or
disable a wing to secure them. The sheldrake
has been known to breed with the common
duck; but it is not well ascertained whether
the hybrids thus produced will breed
again or not.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>This species is dispersed in greater or less
numbers, over the warm as well as the cold
climates, in various parts of the world; they
are met with as far north as Iceland in the
spring, and in Sweden and the Orkney Islands
in the winter. Captain Cook notices
them, among other sea fowl, on the coast of
Van Diemen’s Land; and they have been seen
in great numbers at the Falkland Islands.
Although they are not numerous on the British
and the opposite shores, yet they are
common enough in the British Isles, where
they remain throughout the year, always in
pairs, and occasionally straggle away from the
sea coasts to the lakes inland.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

respects excellent. There have been instances
of these animals whose height from the foot
to the shoulder scarcely exceeded three feet,
and a man of ordinary size and strength can
lift one of them from the ground with great
ease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general form of these ponies is very
elegant, and their body is thicker and more
compact than that of a blood-horse; they
have small legs and large manes, their bones
are exceedingly small, as is also their head,
and that part of the neck which joins to it,
the most common colours are grey, bay, and
black. The latter are esteemed the hardiest,
whilst those that are pied seldom prove good.
They sometimes live to the age of thirty
years and upwards, notwithstanding the little
care that is bestowed on them in sheltering
them from the cold, which, in the climate of
the Shetland Islands, is peculiarly severe in
the winter: but from the circumstance of
their being compelled to live out of doors
during even the severest months of the year,
great numbers are occasionally frozen to death.
At this season, when the ground is entirely
covered with snow, the wretched animals are
compelled to seek subsistence on the sea-weeds,
which, once in every twelve hours,
are left exposed by the tide.—<i>Illustrations

has long and slightly curled hair, and its eyes
are almost hid in the curls. It is of a small
size, and is used in this country and on the
continent as a lap-dog. It is a useless little
animal, seeming to possess no other quality than
a faithful attachment to its mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have never seen one of these diminutive
little creatures which would take the water,
although they possess all the requisites for
swimming. This may probably be accounted
for from the frequency of their immersion in
that element, contrary to their inclination, for
the purpose of washing them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Preparation of the Foot.</i>—We will
suppose that the horse is sent to the forge to
be shod. If the master would occasionally
accompany him there, he would find it much
to his advantage. The old shoe must be first
taken off. We have something to observe
even on this. It was retained on the foot by
the ends of the nails being twisted off, turned
down, and clenched. These clenches should
be first raised, which the smith seldom takes
the trouble thoroughly to do; but after going
carelessly round the crust, and raising one or
two of the clenches, he takes hold first of
one heel of the shoe, and then of the other,
and by a violent wrench separates them from
the foot, and by a third wrench, applied to the
middle of the shoe, he tears it off. By this
means he must enlarge every nail hole, and
weaken the future hold, and sometimes tear
off portions of the crust, and otherwise injure
the foot. The horse generally shows by his
flinching that he suffers by the violence with
which this preliminary operation is performed.
The clenches should always be raised or filed
off; and where the foot is tender, or the horse
is to be examined for lameness, each nail
should be partly punched out. Many a stub
is left in the crust, the source of future annoyance,
when this unnecessary violence is used.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shoe having been removed, the smith
proceeds to rasp the edges of the crust. Let
not the stander-by object to the apparent violence
which he uses, or fear that the foot will
suffer. It is the only means he has, with
safety to his instruments, to detect whether
any stubs remain in the nail-holes, and it is
the most convenient method of removing that
portion of the crust into which dirt and gravel
have insinuated themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next comes the important process of paring
out, with regard to which it is almost impossible
to lay down any specific rules. This,
however, we can say with confidence, that
more injury has been done by the neglect of
paring, than by carrying it to too great an extent.
The act of paring is a work of much
more labour than the proprietor of the horse
often imagines; the smith, except he be overlooked,
will give himself as little trouble
about it as he can; and that, which in the unshod
foot would be worn away by contact
with the ground, is suffered to accumulate
month after month, until the elasticity of the
sole is destroyed, and it can no longer descend,
and the functions of the foot are impeded,
and foundation is laid for corn, and contraction,
and navicular disease, and inflammation.
That portion of horn should be left on the
sole, which will defend the internal parts from
being bruised, and yet suffer the external sole
to descend. How is this to be measured?
The strong pressure of the thumb of the
smith will be the best guide. The buttress,
that most destructive of all instruments, being
banished from the respectable forge, the smith
sets to work with his drawing knife, and he
removes the growth of horn until the sole will
yield, although in the slightest possible degree,
to the very strong pressure of his thumb.
The proper thickness of horn will then remain.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the foot has been previously neglected,
and the horn is become very hard, the owner
must not object if the smith resorts to some
means to soften it a little; and if he takes
one of his flat irons, and, having heated it,
draws it over the sole, and keeps it a little
while in contact with it. When the sole is
thick, this rude and apparently barbarous method
can do no harm, but it should never be
permitted with the sole that is regularly pared
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The quantity of horn to be removed in
order to leave the proper degree of thickness
will vary with different feet. From the strong
foot a great deal must be taken. From the
concave foot the horn may be removed until
the sole will yield to a moderate pressure.
From the flat foot little need be pared; while
the pumiced foot will spare nothing but the
ragged parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The paring being nearly completed, the
knife and the rasp of the smith must be a
little watched, or he will reduce the crust to
a level with the sole, and thus endanger the
bruising of the sole by its pressure on the
edge of the seating. The crust should be
reduced to a perfect level all round, but left
a little higher than the sole.</p>

<p class='c006'>The heels will require very considerable
attention. From the stress which is thrown
on the inner heel, and from the weakness of
the quarter there, it usually wears considerably
faster than the outer one; and if an equal
portion of horn were pared from it, it would
be left lower than the outer heel. The smith
should, therefore, accommodate his paring to
the comparative wear of the heels, and be
very careful to leave them precisely level.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the reader will recollect what we have
said of the intention and action of the bars,
he will readily perceive that the smith should
be checked in his almost universal fondness
for opening the heels, or, more truly, removing
that which is the main impediment to contraction.
That portion of the heels between
the inflection of the bar and the frog should
scarcely be touched, at least nothing but the
ragged and detached parts should be cut away.
The foot may not look so pretty, but it will
last longer without contraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bar likewise should be left fully prominent,
not only at its first inflection, but as
it runs down the side of the frog. The heel
of our shoe is designed to rest partly on the
heel of the foot, and partly on the bar, for
reasons that have been already stated. If the
bar is weak, the growth of it should be encouraged,
and it should be scarcely touched
at the shoeing until it has attained a level
with the crust. We recal to the recollection
of our readers the observation which we have
before made, that the destruction of the bars
not only leads to contraction by removing a
powerful impediment to it, but by adding a
still more powerful cause in the slanting direction
which is given to the bearing at the heels,
when the bar does not contribute to the support
of the weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will also be apparent that the horn between
the crust and the bar should be carefully
pared out. Every horseman has observed
the relief which is given to the animal
lame with corns when this angle is well
thinned; a relief, however, which is but temporary,
for when the horn grows again and
the shoe presses upon it, the torture of the
animal is renewed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The degree of paring to which the frog
must be subjected will depend on its prominence,
and on the shape of the foot. The
principle has already been stated, that it must
be left so far projecting and prominent, that
it shall be just within and above the lower
surface of the shoe, it will then descend with
the sole sufficiently to discharge the functions
which we have attributed to it. If it be
lower it will be bruised and injured; if it be
higher it cannot come in contact with the
ground, and thus be enabled to do its duty.
The ragged parts must be removed, and especially
those occasioned by thrush, but the
degree of paring must depend entirely on
this principle.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears, then, that the office of the
smith requires some skill and judgment in
order to be properly discharged; and the horse
proprietor will find it his interest occasionally
to visit the forge and complain of the careless,
or idle, or obstinate, and reward, by
some trifling gratuity, the expert and diligent.
He should likewise remember that a great
deal more depends on the paring out of the
foot than on the construction of the shoe;
that few shoes, except they press upon the
sole, or are made outrageously bad, will lame
the horse; but that he may be very easily lamed
from ignorant and improper paring out of the
foot.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The putting on of the Shoe.</i>—The foot
being thus prepared, the smith looks about
for a shoe. He should select one that as
nearly as possible fits the foot, or may be
altered to the foot. He will sometimes care
little about this, for he can easily alter the
foot to the shoe. The toe-knife is a very
convenient instrument for him, and plenty of
horn can be struck off with it, or removed by
the rasp, to make the foot as small as the
shoe; while he cares little, although by this
destructive method the crust is materially
thinned where it should receive the nail, and
the danger of puncture is increased, and the
danger of pressure upon the sole is increased,
and a foot so artificially diminished in size
will soon grow over the shoe, to the hazard
of considerable or permanent lameness.</p>

<p class='c006'>While choosing the shoe we must once
more refer to the shape of our pattern shoe;
the web is of equal thickness from toe to
heel. A shoe, thinner at the heel than at
the toe, by letting down the heel too low, is
apt to produce sprain of the flexor tendon,
and a shoe thicker at the heels than at the
toe is fit only to elevate the frog, to the destruction
of its function, and to its own certain
disease, and also to press upon and to
batter and to bruise that part of the foot
which is soonest and most destructively injured.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Hinder Shoe.</i>—In forming the hinder
shoe it should be remembered that the hind
limbs are the principal instruments in progression,
that in every act of progression, except
the walk, the toe is the point on which
the whole frame of the animal turns, and
from which it is propelled. This part, then,
should be strengthened as much as possible;
and, therefore, the hinder shoes are made
broader at the toe than the fore ones, and the
toe of the foot, which is naturally broader
than that of the fore-foot, is still further
widened by rasping. Another good effect is
produced by this, that the hinder foot being
shortened there is less danger of overreaching
or forging, and especially if the shoe be wider
on the foot surface than on the ground one;
and thus the shoe is made to slope inward,
and is a little within the toe of the crust.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shape of the hinder foot is somewhat
different from that of the fore foot; it is
straighter in the quarters, and the shoe must
have the same shape. For carriage and
draught horses generally, calkins may be put
on the heels, because the animal will be thus
enabled to dig his toe more firmly into the
ground, and urge himself forward, and throw
his weight into the collar with greater advantage.
But the calkins must not be too high,
and they must be of an equal height on each
heel; otherwise, as has been stated with regard
to the fore feet, the weight will not be
fairly distributed over the foot, and some part
of the foot or of the leg will materially suffer.
The nails in the hinder shoe may be placed
nearer to the heel than in the fore shoe, because,
from the comparative little weight and
concussion thrown on the hinder feet, there is
not so much danger of contraction.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Different kinds of Shoes.</i>—The shoe will
vary in substance and weight with the kind
of foot, and the nature of the work. A weak
foot should never wear a heavy shoe, nor any
foot a shoe that will last longer than a month.
Here, perhaps, we may be permitted to caution
the horse-proprietor against having his
cattle shod too much by contract, unless he
binds down his farrier or surgeon to remove
the shoes once at least in every month; for
if the contractor, by a heavy shoe and a little
steel, can cause five or six weeks to intervene
between the shoeings, he will do so, although
the feet of the horse must necessarily suffer.
The shoe should never be heavier than the
work requires. An ounce or two in the
weight of the shoe will sadly tell before the
end of a hard day’s work. This is acknowledged
in the hunter’s shoe, which is narrower
and lighter than that of the hackney with even
smaller feet than the hunter; and it is more
decidedly acknowledged in the racer, who
wears a shoe only sufficiently thick to prevent
it from bending when used.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Hunting Shoe.</i>—The hunter’s shoe
is different from that of the hackney in shape
as well as weight. It is not so much bevelled
off as the common concave seated shoe. Sufficient
space alone is left for the introduction
of a picker between the shoe and the sole,
otherwise, in going over heavy ground, the
clay will get in, and by its tenacity loosen,
and even tear off the shoe. The heels likewise
are somewhat shorter, that they may not
be torn off by the toe of the hind-feet when
galloping fast, and the outer heel is frequently
and injudiciously turned up to prevent slipping.
The reader will remember what we
have just said of this. If calkins are necessary,
let, at least, both heels have an equal bearing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Bar-Shoe.</i>—A bar-shoe is a very useful
contrivance. It is the continuation of the
common shoe round the heels, and by means
of it the pressure may be taken off some
tender part of the foot and thrown on another
which is better able to bear it, or more widely
and equally diffused over the whole foot. It
is principally resorted to in cases of corn, the
seat of which it perfectly covers—in pumiced
feet, the soles of which may be thus elevated
above the ground and secured from pressure—in
sand-crack, when the pressure may be
removed from the fissure and thrown on either
side of it—in thrushes, when the frog is tender,
or is become cankered, and requires to be
frequently dressed, and the dressing can by
this means alone be retained. In these cases
the bar-shoe is an excellent contrivance, if
worn only for one or two shoeings, or as long
as the disease requires it to be worn, but it
must be left off as soon as it can be dispensed
with. If it be used for the protection of a
diseased foot, however it may be chambered
and laid off the frog, it will soon be flattened
down upon it; or if the pressure of it be
thrown on the frog to relieve the sand-crack
or the corn, that frog must be very strong and
healthy which can long bear the great and
continued pressure. More mischief is often
produced in the frog than previously existed
in the part which was relieved. It will be
plain that in the use of the bar-shoe for corn
or sand-crack, the crust and the frog should
be precisely on a level, and the bar should be
the widest part of the shoe, to afford as extended
bearing as possible on the frog, and
therefore less likely to be injurious. Bar-shoes
are evidently not safe in frosty weather;
they are never safe when much speed is required
from the horse, and they are apt to be
wrenched off in a heavy, clayey country.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tips</i> are short shoes reaching only half
round the foot, and worn while the horse is
at grass to prevent the crust being torn by the
occasional hardness of the ground, or by the
pawing of the animal; and the quarters at the
same time being free, the foot disposed to contract
has a chance of expanding and regaining
its natural shape.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Expanding Shoe.</i>—Our subject
would not be complete if we did not describe
the supposed expanding shoe. It is either
seated or concave like the common shoe, with
a joint at the toe, by which the natural expansion
of the foot is said to be permitted,
and the injurious consequences of shoeing
prevented. There is, however, this radical
defect in the jointed shoe, that the nails occupy
the same situation as in the common shoe,
and prevent, as do the nails of the common
shoe, the gradual expansion of the sides and
quarters, and allow only of a hinge-like motion
at the toe. This is a most imperfect accommodation
of the expansion of the foot to
the action of its internal parts, and even this
accommodation is afforded in the slightest
possible degree, or rather can scarcely be afforded
at all. Either the nails fix the sides
and quarters as in the common shoe, and
then the joint at the toe is useless; or, if
that joint merely opens like a hinge, the nail-holes
in the shoe can no longer correspond
with those in the quarters which are unequally
expanding at every point; and, therefore,
there will be more stress on the crust at these
holes, which will not only enlarge them, and
destroy the fixed attachment of the shoe to
the hoof, but will often tear away portions of
the crust. This has, in many cases, been
found to be the effect of the jointed shoe:
the sides and quarters of the foot have been
broken until it has become difficult to find
nail-hold. This shoe, to answer the intended
purpose, should consist of many joints, running
along the sides and quarters, which would
make it too complicated and expensive, and
frail for general use.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the shoe is to be attached to the
foot by nails, we must be content with the
concave seated one, taking care to place the
nail-holes as far from the heels, and particularly
from the inner heel, as the state of the
foot and the nature of the work will admit;
and where the country is not too heavy nor
the work too severe, even omitting the nails
on the inner side of the foot. Shoes nailed
on the outer side, and at the toe, are more
secure than some would imagine, while the
inner quarter will be left free, to prevent contraction,
or to arrest its progress.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attempt, however, to lessen the evils
produced by shoeing is most praiseworthy;
and men like Mr. Bracey Clark deserve the
respect and thanks of the public, although
their labours may not be crowned with success.
Every contrivance permanently to fix
the shoe on the foot without the use of nails,
has failed; but a make-shift shoe has been
contrived, and is to be procured at most saddlers,
which is easily carried in the pocket,
and put on in a minute or two if a shoe is lost
in hunting or on the road; and which will
remain securely attached to the foot, and prevent
injury to it, during a journey of thirty
or forty miles.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Felt or Leather Soles.</i>—When the foot
is bruised or inflamed, the concussion or shock
produced by the hard contact of the elastic
iron on the ground gives the animal much
pain, and causes a short and feeling step, or
even lameness, and aggravates the injury or
disease. A strip of felt or leather is sometimes
placed between the seating of the shoe
and the crust, which, from its want of elasticity,
deadens, or materially lessens the vibration
or shock, and the horse treads more
freely, and is evidently relieved. This is a
very good contrivance while the inflammation
or tenderness of the foot continues, but a very
bad practice if constantly adopted. The nails
cannot be driven so surely or so securely
when this substance is interposed between the
shoe and the foot; the contraction and swelling
of the felt or leather, from the effect of
moisture or dryness, will soon render the attachment
of the shoe less firm; there will
be too much play upon the nails; the nail-holes
will enlarge, and the crust will be
broken away.</p>

<p class='c006'>After wounds or extensive bruises of the
sole, or where the sole is thin and flat and
tender, it is sometimes covered with a piece of
leather, fitted to the sole, and nailed on with
the shoe. This may be allowed as a temporary
defence of the foot; but there is the
same objection to its permanent use from the
insecurity of fastening, and the strain on the
crust, and the frequent chipping of it: and
there are these additional inconveniences, that
if the hollow between the sole and the leather
be filled with stopping and tow, it is exceedingly
difficult to introduce them so evenly
and accurately as not to produce some partial
or injurious pressure—that a few days’ work
will almost invariably so derange the padding
as to produce partial pressure—that the long
contact of the sole with stopping of almost
every kind will produce, not a healthy, elastic
horn, but horn of a scaly, spongy nature;
and that if the hollow be not thus filled,
gravel and dirt will insinuate themselves, and
cause unequal pressure, and eat into and injure
the foot.—<i>The Horse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Shoot</span>, <i>v.</i> To discharge anything so as to make it fly with speed or
violence; to discharge from a bow or gun; to let off; to perform the
act of shooting; to germinate; to be emitted; to protuberate; to jut
out; to pass as an arrow; to feel a quick pain.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Instructions in Shooting</i>—But (to be
brief, which is here my study) allow me to
suggest an humble attempt for the instruction
of the complete novice, first, let him take a
gun that he can manage, and be shown how to
put it to his shoulder, with the breach and sight
on a level, and make himself master of bringing
them up to a wafer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, with a wooden or bone driver (instead
of a flint) let him practise at this mark;
and when he thinks he can draw his trigger
without flinching, he may present the gun to
your right eye, by which you will see, at once,
if he is master of his first lesson. In doing
this he must remember, that the moment the
gun is brought up to the centre of the object,
the trigger should be pulled, as the first sight
is always unquestionably the best.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then send him out to practise at a card with
powder, till he has got steady, and afterwards
load his gun, occasionally, with shot, but never
let the time of your making this addition
be known to him; and the idea of it being,
perhaps, impossible to strike his object, will
remove all anxiety, and he will soon become
perfectly collected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The intermediate lesson of a few shots at
small birds may be given; but this plan
throughout must be adopted at game, and
continued, in the first instance, till the pupil
has quite divested himself of all tremor at
the springing of a covey, and observed in the
last, till most of his charges of shot have
proved fatal to the birds. If he begins with
both eyes open, he will save himself the
trouble of learning to shoot so afterwards.
An aim thus, from the right shoulder, comes
to the same point as one taken with the left
eye shut, and it is the most ready method of
shooting quick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Be careful to remind him (as a beginner)
to keep his gun moving, as follows: before
an object, crossing; full high for a bird rising
up, or flying away very low; and between the
ears of hares and rabbits running straight
away. All this, of course, in proportion to
the distance; and if we consider the velocity
with which a bird flies, we shall rarely err by
firing, when at forty yards, at least five or six
inches before it. Till the pupil is <i>au fait</i> in
all this, he will find great assistance from the
sight, which he should have precisely on the
intended point, when he fires. He will thus,
by degrees, attain the art of killing his game
in good style, which is to fix his eyes on the
object, and fire the moment he has brought
up the gun. He may then ultimately acquire
the knack of killing snap shots, and bring
down a November bird the moment it tops
the stubble, or a rabbit popping into a furze-brake,
with more certainty than he was once
used to shoot a young grouse in August, or a
partridge in September.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many begin with very quick shooting, and
kill admirably well, but are often apt not to let
their birds fly before they put up their guns,
and therefore dreadfully mangle them, and, I
have already observed, are not such every-day
shots as those who attain their rapid execution
on a slow and good principle.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>As shots in the field, at game, Mr. Jenkins,
near Petworth, Sussex, and Cottingham,
who was formerly gamekeeper to Lord Roos,
are perhaps the best. The former has killed
twenty brace of partridges in a day, at forty
shots, without selecting the shots, but took
them fairly as they happened; and in four
days’ shooting, has never missed. The latter
I was out with when he killed, in two days,
forty-three successive shots (many of them
in covert) at partridge, pheasant, woodcock,
and hare; and his style of shooting,
when open, and he could give time, was
most regularly deliberate.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Should different guns be employed, the
shooter should have all the locks made, if
possible, to require exactly the same pull to
bring them to action; there is nothing deceives
or disconcerts him more than shooting
one day with a stiff, and the next with an
easy going lock; the transition from that
which goes off with a slight, to that where a
hard touch is necessary, will often cause the
most expert to miss his bird.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If a rival shooter (some stranger) races to
get before you, push him hard for a long time,
always letting him have rather the advantage,
and then give him the double without his seeing
you. Having done this, go quietly round
(supposing you have been beating up wind);
and, on reaching the place where you began,
work closely and steadily the whole of the
ground or covert that you have both been
racing over, and you will be sure to kill more
game than him, who is beating and shooting
in haste, through fear of your getting up to
him; and (if the wind should rise) driving
the dispersed, and consequently closest lying
birds to your beat, as fast as he finds them.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Beware of the muzzle of the gun being kept
hanging downwards; when so carried, the shot
is apt to force its way from the powder, especially
in clean barrels; if it happens that a
space of sixteen or eighteen inches is thus obtained,
and the gun fired with its point below
the horizon, it is ten to one but the barrel
bursts. There are other perilous consequences
besides those that generally accompany the
disruption of a barrel, for the men, horses, and
dogs, are in perpetual danger of being shot
when a gun is carried in the before-mentioned
pendent manner.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When a gun begins to exhibit symptoms of
having done its work, the sooner a man discards
it the better. An injured barrel or enfeebled
lock may prove fatal to the owner or
his associates. Accidents every day occur, and
very lamentable consequences proceed, from
a culpable neglect in retaining arms which
should be declared unserviceable and disused.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had once a favourite gun, which from constant
wear and tear exhibited unequivocal
weakness in the locks, and which I had been
earnestly recommended by a veteran sportsman
to condemn. On a cold and rainy day,
I was with my friend O’M——, shooting
woodcocks in the heath, and having sprung several,
which from the severity of the weather
were wild as hawks, we marked them into a
ravine, and determined to tie up the dogs and
endeavour to steal upon them. To keep my
gun dry I placed it under the skirt of my
jacket, with the muzzle pointing downwards.
My companion and our attendant were busy
coupling the dogs, when the gun exploded, and
the charge passing between O’M——’s bosom
and the back of a dog he was in the act of securing,
buried itself at the foot of the keeper,
covering him with mud and gravel. From the
close manner in which we were all grouped,
how the shot could have entered the ground
without killing men or dogs, or both, was miraculous.
I was desperately frightened, and
from that moment forswore for ever, the use
of weakened locks and attenuated barrels.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In March, 1799, Sir John Swinborne, having
flashed off his gun, which was single barrelled
with a patent antechambered breech,
proceeded to the dog-kennel; in his opinion,
at least five minutes must have elapsed before
he began to load; having primed, he poured
the charge from the top of the flask into the
barrel, when the whole copper flask, containing
nearly a pound of gunpowder, instantly
exploded. A large piece of copper struck the
right eye, and injured the bone above, so that
it continued to exfoliate for two years. The
lock remained at half bent, and it cannot be
doubted that some tow, which had been left
in the barrel or chamber, continued on fire
from the time of flashing off, and occasioned
the misfortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>In every instance but one, where the particulars
have been ascertained, of the numerous
accidents of the above description, the
explosion has happened upon the second time
of pouring powder into the barrel on that day;
which is strong evidence of the cause here
suggested.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The following sporting precepts may be
serviceable to inexperienced shooters:—</p>

<p class='c006'>First—If you or your dog should, at any
time, get a severe blow, let the wounded part
be instantly fomented with water, as hot as
can be borne, for at least half an hour, and
you will thereby reduce your suffering, or
impediment from sport, to at least half its
duration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly—If you burn yourself in shooting,
or otherwise, wrap the part affected immediately
in cotton, the application of which,
it has been proved, acts like magic with a burn.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thirdly—If you should take cold, bathe
your feet in hot water; if a little salt or bran
is, or both are, added, so much the better.
Get into a bed warmed, with a little brown
sugar sprinkled on the coals, and take some
whey, or whatever you can get to promote
perspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fourthly—Never fast too long, and avoid,
whenever you can, fagging too hard.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifthly—Never go out with quite an empty
stomach, to wait for wild fowl, particularly in
the morning. Should you wish to start before
any one is up, you might always have
left for you over night, a crust of bread, or a
biscuit, with a glass of milk, which, with a
little sugar, nutmeg, ginger, and the yolk of
an egg, may be good in a moment, and this is
better than what is called a “doctor,” (rum
and milk), because you then dispense with
taking spirit in a morning, the very bad habit
of which, should always be avoided, except in
a country where the chances of ague might
justify your taking a little purl.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sixthly—Never sit down in wet feet, or
with wet clothes on any part of your body,
but, if a change is not at hand, keep in motion,
or go to bed, till one can be procured.
Or, if you want to start again, when refreshed,
first wet your feet with either spirits or essence
of mustard, and then be as quick as
possible in taking your refreshment. Many
people prefer applying the spirit to the inside,
instead. This is not so well, because spirit
alone always flies to the head, while strong
beer, on the contrary, would warm the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall here conclude, under this head, with
the <i>multum in parvo</i> advice of the great
Dr. Boerhaave; keep the body open, the
head cool, and the feet warm.—<i>Hawker</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Wild
Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Shooter</span>, <i>s.</i> One who shoots; an archer, a gunner.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Shortwinged</span>, <i>a.</i> Having short wings. So hawks are divided into long
and short winged.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Shot</span>, <i>s.</i> The act of shooting; the flight of a shot; the charge of a gun;
bullets or small pellets for the charge of a gun; anything discharged
from a gun, or other instrument; a sum charged, a reckoning.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Shot.</i>—The choice of this article is highly
worthy of the sportsman’s care. It should be
equal, round, and void of cavities. The patent
milled shot is, at this time, to be preferred
to all other sorts, and is in such general
use, that the instructions which here follow
on the size of shot to be adopted in the
different chases, must be understood to relate
to the patent shot only.</p>

<p class='c006'>The difference, however, which subsists
between the sizes of patent and of common
shot, will be hereafter shown by means of a
table, denoting the number of pellets contained
in a given weight of each, so that in
cases where the former cannot be procured,
it will be easy to adopt the rules there laid
down, to the latter, by only taking the same
number of grains in the common, as directed
to be used for the patent shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is extremely important for the success of
the chase, that the sportsman should proportion
the size of his shot, as well to the particular
species of game he means to pursue, as
the season of killing it. Thus in the first
month of partridge-shooting, shot No. 1,
should be used; for since, at this time, the
birds spring near at hand, and we seldom fire
at more than the distance of forty yards, if
the shooter takes his aim but tolerably well,
it is almost impossible for a bird at this distance
to escape in the circle or disk which the
shot forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hares also, at this season of the year, sit
closer, and being at the same time thinly covered
with fur, may easily be killed with this
sized shot at thirty or thirty-five paces.</p>

<p class='c006'>In snipe and quail-shooting this sized shot
is peculiarly proper, for, in using a larger size,
however true the sportsman may shoot, yet he
will frequently miss, the objects being so small
that they have great chance of escaping in
the vacant spaces of the circle or disk. Yet
there are many sportsmen who shoot snipes,
quails, and fieldfares, in countries where they
abound, with the sizes six and seven of the
common shot, the last of which is called mustard-seed.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the beginning of October, at which
time the partridges are stronger in the wing,
No. 3 is the proper shot to be used. This
size seems to be the best of any; it preserves
a proper medium between shot too large and
that which is too small, and will kill a hare
from the distance of thirty-five or forty paces,
and a partridge at fifty, provided the powder
be good. It will serve also for rabbit-shooting.
In short, it is excellent for all seasons, and
many sportsmen use no other the season
round.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is true that distant objects are frequently
missed for want of large shot, but then these
bear no proportion to the number that are
daily missed, by using shot of too large a
size, especially with the feathered game. If
a man was to shoot constantly with shot number
five, for one partridge which he might
chance to kill with a single pellet at the distance
of eighty paces, he would miss twenty
birds at eighty paces, which would in such
case escape in the vacant spaces of the circle.
But if the sportsman expressly purposes to
shoot wild ducks or hares, then indeed he had
better use the number five. However, in
shooting with a double barrel gun, it may be
prudent to load one of the barrels with large
shot for the necessary occasions, and if in any
case large shot is required, number five will
be found to be better than any other, for its
size is not so large as to prevent it from garnishing
or being equally spread in the circle,
and it can at the same time perform, in effect,
all that a larger sized shot can do, which garnishes
but very little, if any at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order, therefore, to show clearly, and at
one view, the comparative difference in garnishing
of shot of different sizes, we here
subjoin a table which indicates the number of
pellets precisely composing an ounce weight
of each sort of shot, the patent and the common,
commencing at the smallest size in each.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pleasure of using and counting the
dust shot I leave to those who recommend it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shot of different manufacturers varies
much in size: for example, an ounce of No.
7, from Messrs. Walker and Parker, amounts
to 341 pellets; and the same weight, from
Mr. Beaumont (late Preston), 398; and in
some places the numbers are reversed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many sportsmen recommend the use of
unglazed shot; others wet their shot with oil.
I have tried both these plans repeatedly, but
could not find sufficient advantage in either
to justify my recommending them. The object
of both is to prevent the gun from leading;
and as they can do no harm, I should if
a choice readily offered, prefer using the shot
unglazed, or oiled, for the chances of any
trifling advantages which may be thereby derived.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>If I mistake not, you are shooting grouse
with No. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agilis.</i> I was told that so large a bird
required large shot.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peritus.</i> No doubt there is greater difficulty
in reaching a vital part through a large
opposing substance than a small one; but you
must remember that at this season the whole
plumage of birds has not yet grown, the muscles
and sinews are not yet so strong and firm
as they will be; and the flight of all birds is
slower than in winter; on such account I
would use much smaller shot now than later
in the season; and indeed you will find sevens
now as efficient as fours will be in two months’
time. You must remember that to bring
down a bird you must either strike it in a
vital part, or impede its flight, and the fewer
the shots that strike, the less likely you are
to attain that object. I once fired a small
bullet through a black cock, and he flew so
far that he was only found by accident afterwards.
But I will repeat to you my ideas as
to the sizes of shot best calculated both for
England and Scotland, as we are upon the
subject:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Partridge, hare.—From September 1 to
October 1, No. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>Partridge, hare, woodcock, rabbit, pheasant.—From

<p class='c006'>Grouse—From August 12 to September 1,
No. 7; from September 1 to September 25,
No. 6; from September 25 to the end of the
season, No. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>Black game.—From August 20 to September
1, No. 7; from September 1 to September
10, No. 6; from September 1 to October 10,
No. 5; from October 10 to the end of the
season, No. 4 or 5, as the gun may shoot close
or scatter: if it scatter, the smaller shot of
the two.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The greater or lesser diameter of the bore
cannot produce any sensible difference in the
closeness or wideness with which the shot is
thrown, provided the charge he the same in
both pieces. We have subjected this matter
to the test of experiment, and the result has
accordingly been that a barrel of 22 or 24,
which is the largest calibre usually employed
in fowling-pieces, threw its shot as closely as
one of the smallest calibre, viz. of 30 or 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a curious circumstance attending
the shot of barrels, which is, that sometimes
the grains of lead, instead of being equally
distributed over the space they strike, are
thrown in clusters of ten, twelve, fifteen, or
more, whilst several considerable spaces have
not a single grain in them; sometimes a cluster
of this kind consists of one-third or one-half
of the charge, and it also happens sometimes,
though more rarely, that the whole
charge collects itself into one mass, so as to
pierce a board near an inch thick, at the distance
of forty or forty-five paces. Small barrels
are said to be more liable to this than
large ones, and M. de Marolles says that this
is especially the case when barrels are new,
and when they are fresh washed. He mentions
a double-barrelled piece of 52 calibre,
which was particularly liable to this clustering
and lumping of the shot, but adds that the
same thing did not happen to him with other
barrels of 26 and 28 calibre, which he had
used before. The lumping also may perhaps
depend upon the wadding employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard, then, to the extraordinary
closeness with which some pieces are said to
throw the shot, we certainly shall not take it
upon us to assert that persons who speak of
them wish to deceive us; but we do most
firmly believe that they deceive themselves,
and that their accounts proceed either from
their belief that a gunsmith, by superior skill
and care, is able to make such, or from their
once having seen a piece accidentally lump its
shot in the manner described above. The
result of our experience, however, is very
unfavourable to this prevailing opinion, for we
do affirm that after having fired at a mark
times without number, we have never yet
found a barrel, which, at the distance of fifty
paces, would throw its whole charge with
regularity, we will not say into the breadth of
a hat, but into a space of three feet square.</p>

which she also differs greatly in the colours
of her plumage, the coverts and spangle-spot
on her wings being less brilliant, and the other
parts composed of white, grey, and rusty,
crossed with curved dusky lines, giving her
much the appearance of the common wild
duck. She makes her nest, lined with withered
grasses, on the ground, in the midst
of the largest tufts of rushes or coarse herbage,
in the most inaccessible parts of the shaky
marsh. She lays ten or twelve pale, rusty-coloured
eggs; and as soon as the young are
hatched, they are conducted to the water by
the parent birds, who watch and guard them
with the greatest care.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are at first very shapeless and ugly,
for the bill is then almost as broad as the body,
and seems too great a weight for the little
bird to carry. Their plumage does not acquire
its full colours until after the second moult.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has not yet been ascertained whether the
shoveller breeds in England, where, indeed, it
is a scarce bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is of so wild, shy, and solitary
a disposition, that all attempts hitherto made
to domesticate them have failed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The anas muscaria of Linnæus (<i>Le Souchet
à ventre blanc</i> of Brisson) differs only from
this in having the belly white, and is considered
merely as a variety of the same species.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is rather superior in size to the
raven; weight three pounds; length two
feet; the bill is an inch and three quarters
long, black, and much hooked at the end; is
covered, for more than half its length, with a
kind of black cere; the upper part of the

<p class='c006'>This is a bold rapacious bird, and preys on
the lesser gulls, as well as fish; it is said to
attack the eagle, and even man, if he approaches
their nest. It breeds in the Orkney
Islands, and is much esteemed in the Isle of
Foulah, from a supposition that it defends the
flocks from the eagle: it is rarely seen in the
south. One in the museum of Dr. Latham,
was killed at Greenwich; and the only other

being observed in the south of England, was

<p class='c006'>The length of this species is seven inches;
bill dusky; the base of the upper mandible
yellowish; the feathers on the top of the head
are dusky, bordered with rufous brown; they
are rather long, and erectable in form of a
short crest; the hind part is plain, inclining
to ash-colour; on the upper parts of the body
the feathers are reddish brown, darker in their
middle, their edges pale; the under parts are
dirty buff-colour, darkest on the neck and
breast, which parts are streaked with dusky;
quills brown, lighter on the outer webs and
tips; the tail is dusky brown, the two middle
feathers darkest, with light rufous margins;
the outer feather is white on the outer web
and tip of the inner; the second feather white
on the outer web only; the third is inclining
to white on the margin of the outer web; legs
dusky in old birds, but lighter in young;
claws dusky; the hind one very long and
straight.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is common in the greater part of
this kingdom, but most plentiful in the more
open and highest cultivated situations abounding
with corn, and rarely seen on the extended

<p class='c006'><i>Sleep of Birds.</i>—Like horses and some
other quadrupeds, a great number of birds sleep
standing; the perchers, (<i>Insessores</i>, <span class='sc'>Vigors</span>,)
for example, usually sleep standing on one leg
upon some tree, bush, or other elevation, with
the head turned behind, and the bill thrust
under the feathers on the back, or under the
wing. Indeed, these appear to be the general
habits of the whole race of birds, in regard to
their mode of resting and sleep; for the duck
and goose, although they do not perch, will
frequently sleep standing on one leg upon the
ground, with their heads turned round, and the
bills under the wing. Poultry, although they
invariably perch, if a perch can be obtained,
do not, when sleeping, rest usually on one leg;
but they sink down with their bodies upon the
perch, having their legs compressed under
them. The sky lark sleeps upon the ground
with his legs also similarly compressed. It is
probable also that all the tribes of birds, even
the perchers, occasionally sink down with their
bodies resting on the perch during their soundest
sleep. What is very remarkable in the
structure of their feet and legs is, that the
greater the weight upon the muscles, the more
firmly the claws grasp whatever they lay hold
of; hence the cause that birds do not fall
down in sleep, although most of their senses
are dormant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The motion of the branches of trees produced
by the wind increases, doubtless, the disposition
for sleep in many birds; this may be
exemplified in the common fowl; for placing
its bill under the wing, even in broad day-light,
and swaying it to and fro in the hand for a very
short time, will produce sleep. Most of the
tribe of birds sleep during the night; but there
are many exceptions to this. Owls in particular
are, during the night, much more active
than in the day; their sight, similar to that of
cats, appears to serve them best in the dark.
Many of the duck tribe are not only wakeful,
but feed during the night; so also do the nightjars.
The nightingale, and a few other song-birds,
are also wakeful while in song, during at
least some portion of the night.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Smelt</span>, <i>s.</i> A small sea fish. It is of the salmon species, and in the spawning
season ascends the rivers in great numbers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_491.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The smelt derives its name from having, in
the opinion of some, the scent of a violet, of
others, that of a cucumber; they are met
with in the seas that wash our coasts the whole
year, and seldom go far from shore, except
when they ascend the rivers, which they do
with the tide; and in certain of which it is remarked,
that they appear a long time before they
spawn, being taken in abundance in the Thames
and Dee in November and two succeeding
months; in other rivers not until February, and
in March and April they spawn, and are very
prolific; after which they all return to the
salt water, and are not seen in the rivers until
the next season. It has been observed, that
they never come into the Mersey so long as
there is any snow water in its current; and
that in the spring and beginning of summer
they will run further up than in the decline
of the year; they are also to be met with in
the docks that are opened for the reception of
ships. The smelt is of a very beautiful form
and colour, the head is transparent, and the
skin in general so thin that with a good microscope
the circulation of its blood may be
seen; the irides are silvery, the pupil of a full
black, the under jaw is rather prominent, in
the front of the upper are four large teeth,
those in the sides of both are small; in the
roof of the mouth are two rows, and on the
tongue two others of large teeth; the colour
of the back is whitish, with a cast of green,
beneath which it is varied with blue, and then
succeeds a beautiful gloss of a silvery hue;
the scales are small and readily drop off; the
tail is forked; the flesh is tender, and of a
delicate taste. These fish vary greatly in
size, the largest Mr. P. ever heard of was thirteen
inches long, and weighed half a pound;
they are often sold in the London streets under
the name of dried sparlings, being split
and dried, and are recommended by the gentlemen
who take their gills of a morning, as
adding to the wine a particular relish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smelt is to be angled for (when the
tide runs up is preferable) with a paternoster
line, having five or six hooks as many inches
from each other, and baited differently. The
best bait is very small fresh shrimps (not
boiled), or the tail of a boiled one; next to
these are gentles and red paste; also that
made of boiled shrimps, fine white bread, and
a little honey; cadis, blood-worms; and they
will sometimes take a bit of their own species;
some crumbs of bread steeped in water should
be now and then thrown in to keep them together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walton mentions, that, many years since,
in the month of August, such vast quantities
of smelts came up the Thames, that women
and children became anglers for them; and
that in one day, between London bridge and
Greenwich, not fewer than 2,000 persons were
thus employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this species is about four
ounces; length near twelve inches; the bill
three inches long, dusky; in some the base is
lighter, flattish, and rough at the end; irides
dusky; crown of the head black, with a longitudinal
light rufous line down the middle;
from the base of the upper mandible another
line of the same colour passes on each side
over the eyes; between the bill and eye is a
dusky line; the throat white; cheeks, neck,
and upper breast, mottled with black and
light ferruginous; the back and scapulars are
black, barred with ferruginous-brown, and
striped with yellowish buff-colour, in longitudinal
lines; the quills are black, the first
edged with white; the secondaries tipped with
the same; those next the body are, with their
coverts, striated, and barred with light ferruginous;
lower breast and belly white; vent
brown; upper tail coverts brown, barred with
black; the tail consists of fourteen black feathers,
barred and spotted with dull orange-red
towards the end, with a narrow bar of black
near the tip, where it is pale rufous; legs
vary; in some dusky or lead-colour, others
green.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a plentiful species in most parts of
England; and is found in all situations, in
high as well as low lands, depending much
on the weather. In very wet times it resorts
to the hills; at other times frequents marshes,
where it can penetrate its bill into the earth
after worms, which are its principal food.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some few remain with us the whole year,
and breed in the more extensive marshes and
mountainous bogs. We have frequently
taken the young before they could fly, in the
north of England, and in Scotland. Near
Penryn, in Cornwall, there is a marsh where
several breed annually, and where we have
taken their eggs, which are four in number,
of an olivaceous colour, blotched and spotted
with rufous-brown; some with dusky blotches
at the larger end. The nest is made of the
materials around it; coarse grass, and sometimes
heath. It is placed on a stump or dry
spot, near a plash or swampy place; the eggs
like those of the lapwing, placed invariably
with their ends inwards, being much pointed;
their weight three drachms and a half.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the breeding season, the snipe changes
its note entirely from that it makes in the
winter. The male will keep on wing for an
hour together, mounting like a lark, uttering
a shrill, piping noise; it then descends with
great velocity, making a bleating sound, not
unlike an old goat, which is repeated alternately
round the spot possessed by the female,
especially while she is sitting on her nest.
This bird has been met with in almost every
part of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Great Snipe</i>, (<i>Scolopa Media</i>).—Size
between the woodcock and snipe; weight
eight ounces; length sixteen inches; bill
four inches long, and like that of the woodcock;
crown of the head black, divided down the
middle by a pale stripe; over and beneath
each eye another of the same; the upper part
of the body very like the common snipe; beneath
white; the feathers edged with dusky
black on the neck, breast, and sides; and
those of the belly spotted with the same, but
the middle of it is plain white; quills dusky;
tail reddish, the two middle feathers plain,
the others barred with black; legs black.
He adds, “this is a rare species.” A fine specimen
of it was shot in Lancashire, now in
the Leverian Museum, said also to have been
met with in Kent.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There are a good many snipes in the vicinity
of that place; the marshes, however, frequented
by those birds, are not very extensive,
and may easily be hunted in much less
than a day; but if a person be well acquainted
with the ground, better snipe shooting is
hardly to be met with in any country. As a
proof of this, I have bagged upwards of thirty
brace of those birds in seven or eight hours.
These were either the common or double
snipe, as I was careless of wasting my powder
and shot about the jack or half snipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The double or solitary snipe, I usually
found singly, or at most in pairs. They were
generally so fat as hardly to be able to fly;
indeed, if flushed, their flight was usually very
short, and they presently settled again. They
were nearly twice as large as the common
snipe, and from their heavy and steady flight
they presented the easiest mark possible.
They are considered to be most delicious eating;
four couple was the greatest number of
those birds that I ever killed in Sweden in
any one day. They were by no means plentiful
in the vicinity of Gottenburg.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The double snipe is a bird of passage, and
among those which arrive the latest; in colour
speckled grey, with a long bill. At the
end of July, when the meadows are mowed,
the shooting of these birds with the pointer
commences, and continues till towards the
end of September. They may also be shot
during the spring; but I have observed this
has diminished the autumn shooting. In the
whole round of sporting, this affords one of
the greatest pleasures. These birds are easy
to shoot; and in some places, fifty or sixty,
and considerably more, may be shot in a day,
particularly in autumn, when they are so
fat that they almost burst their skins. They
are most delicious eating.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In the heather surrounding a small lake in
the island of Hoy, in the Orkneys, I found in
the month of August, in 1817, the nests of
ten or twelve couple of snipes. I was grouse
shooting and my dog continually pointed them,
and as there were sometimes three young
ones and two old ones in the nest, the scent
was very powerful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Snipes are usually fattest in frosty weather,
which I believe is owing to this, that in such
weather they haunt only warm springs, where
worms are abundant, and they do not willingly
quit these places, so that they have plenty of
nourishment and rest, both circumstances
favourable to fat. In wet open weather they
are often obliged to make long flights, and their
food is more distributed. The jack-snipe feeds
upon smaller insects than the snipe, small
white larvæ, such as are found in black bogs,
are its favourite food, but I have generally
found seeds in its stomach, once hempseed, and
always gravel. I know not where the jack-snipe
breeds, but I suspect far north. I never
saw their nests or young ones in Germany,
France, Hungary, Illyria, or the British Islands.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1828, in the drains about Labach, in Illyria,
common snipes were seen in the middle
of July. The first double snipes appeared the
first week in September, when likewise woodcocks
were seen; the first jack-snipe seen, did
not appear until three weeks later than the
29th of September. I was informed at Copenhagen,
that the jack-snipe certainly breeds
in Zealand, and I saw a nest with its eggs, said
to be from the island of Sandholm, opposite
Copenhagen, and I have no doubt that this bird
and the double snipe sometimes make their
nests in the marshes of Holstein and Hanover.
An excellent sportsman and good observer informs
me, that in the great royal decoy, or
marsh preserve, near Hanover, he has had
ocular proof of double snipes being raised from
the nest there; but these birds require solitude
and perfect quiet, and, as their food is peculiar,
they demand a great extent of marshy meadow.
Their stomach is the thinnest among birds of
the scolopax tribe, and, as I have said before,
their food seems to be entirely the larvae of the
tribuæ, or congenerous flies.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Snipe Shooting.</i>—Snipes when plenty afford
very excellent sport, it being allowed to
be the pleasantest, on account of the quick
succession of shots; this is also the best shooting
for practice, seldom failing to make indifferent
shots most excellent ones. There is no
shooting that presents such a variety of shots,
scarcely any two being alike.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds usually fly against the wind,
therefore every snipe-shooter should walk
down it, as by that means the bird, if he rises
before him, will fly back, and coming round
him, describe a kind of circle; or at least his
flight, for a certain distance, will not lengthen
the shot, allowing him a certain time to cover
the bird and take good aim; for if he gets up
before him, and should by chance go down the
wind, or from him, it is then the most difficult
shot. It will be proper, in this case, to let the
bird get a little distance from him, as then he
will fly steadier and the slightest grain will
fetch him to the ground.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When shooting snipes in the vicinity of Gottenburg,
one’s sport mainly depends on the
weather. If it blows hard from the westward,
a strong current sets into the river from the
North Sea; this impedes its course, and causes
it to overflow its bounds, in which case many
of the marshes become partially overflown,
when the snipes, from finding little shelter,
usually lie light, and are difficult to approach.
If, on the countrary, the wind should be moderate,
or from the eastward, and the water consequently
low, those birds have abundance of
cover, and it is easy therefore to get within
range of them.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Pointers are made use of by many in shooting
this species of birds, and, what is very singular,
although these birds are so diminutive, in
comparison with game which pointers are most
accustomed to, yet they will stand equally
staunch to them; even to the jack-snipe,
which is the smallest of these birds. If you
make use of a pointer it ought to be a very
old staunch one, for two reasons; the first is,
that this diversion not only spoils young ones,
but slacks their mettle, as the points come so
fast upon them, that if they become habituated
to snipes, they will not look for other game,
by reason of their getting a number of points
without any exertion; secondly, a young
pointer will be too quick for the snipe,—on
the contrary, an old one would not be able
to go out of a very slow pace, and, if under
good command, will give the most satisfaction.
When these birds are very plenty,
the snipe-shooters never make use of a dog,
as they always walk them up, which is found
to answer best, and afford the most sport.</p>

<p class='c006'>A pointer that is much used for grouse or
partridge, should never be taken out snipe or
pheasant shooting; for if he once gets accustomed
to snipes, he will often baulk you on
the moors in the grousing season; for as
snipes are frequently met with at that time
on them, if he points one, he may often give
you a good walk and trouble, before you get
to him, supposing it is game, and you are not
a little mortified to find it only a snipe: and
if accustomed to pheasants, he will be always
puzzling about hedges, and not beat his ground
as he ought to do. An old pointer may also
be made use of for pheasants, as well as snipes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The jack-snipe (<i>Vide</i> <span class='sc'>Judcock</span>) is esteemed
the most difficult shot, although he seldom,
on rising, makes any twistings or twinings,
and will alight or pitch again, after being fired
at, within a couple of hundred yards. Every
sportsman that has been much accustomed to
snipe-shooting, will allow, that a jack-snipe
will suffer himself to be fired at twenty times
in the same field, and will pitch each time so
close to the shooter, that he frequently conceives
that he has wounded him. They lie
so close, that a staunch pointer might remain
at his point until the moon changed, as this
bird will not rise until forced to do so. A most
curious circumstance which occurred respecting
a jack-snipe that was sprung several times by
a Mr. Molloy, formerly a quarter-master of
the 64th regiment, while he was quartered
at Geneva barracks, Ireland, is well worth
relating: he regularly, after his duty was
done, or if he could possibly obtain leave for
a day, used to equip himself for shooting, and
always sprung this jack-snipe, at which he
fired and followed, and the bird used to pitch
so close to him at times, that he was confident
he had shot it, and used to run to take it up,
when, to his great surprise, it would rise and
fly a little farther; he actually acknowledged
he fired, one day, eighteen times at this bird,
and after shooting at it for the whole season,
he happened to be crossing the bog it lay in,
when he put it up, and exclaiming, “there’s
my old friend,” threw his stick at it, and
killed it on the spot. Whenever, after, any
of his brother officers found a jack-snipe, they
were always sure to say, “there goes Quartermaster
Molloy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In Ireland, in the bottoms of the county of
Limerick, about Charleville, these birds are
in the greatest abundance, as it is not uncommon
to hear of a person shooting twenty brace
of them in the morning. The late Sir George
Dunbar, of the 14th regiment of Light Dragoons,
when quartered at Charleville, won a
considerable wager by shooting forty-three
brace between ten o’clock in the morning and
four in the afternoon; and what appears still
more extraordinary is, that although there are
so many sportsmen about that place, who follow
these birds, and others who net them, yet
you find always enough of sport the day following;
for there seem to be as many snipes,
after two months’ destruction, as there were
at the beginning of the season. The compiler
himself has shot twenty brace, frequently, in
a day, in the county of Cork; and, in the
county of Limerick, has fired so often, that
he has been forced to wait for the barrel of
the gun to cool, before he durst attempt to
reload.—<i>Thornville</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Lloyd</i>—<i>Latham</i>—<i>Grieff.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Song of Birds.</i>—As the song of birds is
not allowed to be the effect of love, by an
honourable author on the subject of singing
birds (Daines Barrington), we shall endeavour
to elucidate this matter from experiments on
birds in their natural wild state; and also
endeavour to prove that their notes are innate,
contrary to that author’s opinion. That
confined birds will learn the song of others
they are constantly kept with, there is no
doubt; but then it is generally blended with
that peculiar to the species. In the spring,
the very great exertions of the male birds in
their vociferous notes are certainly the calls to
love; and the peculiar note of each is an unerring
mark for each to discover its own species.
If a confined bird had learned the song
of another, without retaining any part of its
natural notes, and was set at liberty, it is probable
it would never find a mate of its own
species; and even supposing it did, there is no
reason to believe the young of that bird would
be destitute of its native notes; for if nestling
birds have no innate notes peculiar to
the species, and their song is only learned
from the parent bird, how are we to account
for the invariable note each species possesses,
when it happens that two different species are
bred up in the same bush, or in one very contiguous,
or when hatched or fostered by a different
species.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Although there appears considerable force
in these arguments of Montagu, I am disposed
to be of opinion, that birds sing most
frequently from joy and buoyancy of spirits,
and not unfrequently in triumphant defiance
of rivalry or attack. I have a red-breast at
present, who will sing out whenever I snap
my fingers at him; and the sedge-bird sings
when a stone is thrown into the bush where
he may be.</p>

<p class='c006'>Syme’s remarks upon the songs of birds,
are worth quoting. The notes, he says, of
soft-billed birds, are finely-toned, mellow, and
plaintive; those of the hard-billed species are
sprightly, cheerful, and rapid. This difference
proceeds from the construction of the
larynx; as a large pipe of an organ produces
a deeper and more mellow-toned note than a
small pipe, so the trachea of the nightingale,
which is wider than that of the canary, sends
forth a deeper and more mellow-toned note.
Soft-billed birds, also, sing more from the
lower part of the throat than the hard-billed
species. This, together with the greater
width of the larynx of the nightingale and
other soft-billed warblers, fully accounts for
their soft, round, mellow notes, compared with
the shrill, sharp, and clear notes of the canary
and other hard-billed songsters. In a comprehensive
sense, the complete song of birds
includes all the notes they are capable of uttering;
and, taken in this sense, it is analogous
to the speech of man. It is the vehicle
through which these little creatures communicate
and convey to each other their mutual
wishes and their wants. It may be divided
into six distinct separate sounds or parts, each
of which is very expressive, even to us, of
the feelings which agitate the bird at the moment.
To describe their song more fully, we
shall divide it in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c006'>First—The call-note of the male in spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>Second—The loud, clear, ardent, fierce
notes of defiance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Third—The soft, tender, full, melodious,
love warble.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fourth—The notes of fear or alarm, when
danger approaches the nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifth—The note of alarm, or war-cry, when
a bird of prey appears.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sixth—The note the parent-birds utter to
their brood, and the chirp or note of the
young.</p>

<p class='c006'>The note of the young may be again divided
into two; that which they utter while
in the nest, and the chirp after they have left
it; for they are very distinct sounds or notes;
to which may be added, a soft, murmuring
kind of note, emitted by the male, while he
is feeding the female in the nest; and also by
her while she is receiving the food. The
call-note; the warble of love; and the notes
of defiance, or prelude to battle, seem only to
be understood by birds of the same species,
at least in a wild state. Perhaps, in a state
of domestication, birds of different genera, if
nearly allied, may partially comprehend these
notes, as the canary bird does the notes of the
siskin, the goldfinch, and the linnet.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>All the notes comprised in the song of
birds convey delight to the mind of a lover of
nature; but the bird-fanciers only prize their
love warble, and notes of defiance; these
notes, and these only, he considers to be their
song. The musical notes of birds, whether
of love or war, are sweet, and really charming
in themselves; but they perhaps pour on
the mind a greater degree of pleasure than
mere sound is capable of conveying—we mean
the recollections of youthful days, of endearing
incidents, or of scenes connected with
country pleasure. We ourselves prefer the
mellow, plaintive melody of the soft-billed
species; but others give the palm to the
cheerful warble of the hard-billed tribe; which
of these two styles is the sweetest melody we
cannot determine. Both warbles may be
equally fine; and the preference, perhaps,
may depend on taste and feeling. But it is
allowed, by all who have an ear for music, or
rather, we should say, who have an ear and
love for simple natural melody, that the song
or warble of birds is truly delightful; but all
their musical notes cease as soon as the brood
is hatched.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Syme</i>—<i>Rennie.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Hawker’s recipe for a mountain soup is

<p class='c006'>Three pounds of meat, a large carrot, two
onions, and two turnips. (The Frenchman
adds also a cabbage; here John Bull may
please himself.) Put them into two quarts
of water, to simmer away till reduced to three
pints. Let him season the soup to the taste,
with pepper, salt, herbs, &amp;c. He must then
cut off square, a pound of the fattest part
of the meat, and put it aside, letting the rest
boil completely to pieces. After he has well
skimmed off the fat, and strained the soup,
let him put it by till wanted.</p>

<p class='c006'>On your return, while seeing your dogs
fed, which every sportsman ought to do, let
the soup be put on the fire for twenty minutes,
with some fresh vegetables, (if you like
to have them,) and, for the last ten minutes,
boil again the square piece of meat which
was reserved. Another necessary part of the
recipe also should be prescribed, lest the dish
should fall into disrepute. To prevent the
deputy cook from helping himself, and filling
it up with water, let him have a partnership in
the concern, and when he has occasion to
quit the room, he should either lock the door,
or leave one of your relay dogs for a sentry.</p>

<p class='c006'>You will then have a good wholesome
gravy-soup to begin with, and afterwards some
tender meat, which, if eaten with mustard, a
little raw parsley chopped fine, and a few anchovies,
you will, it is presumed, find an excellent
dish. A pot of anchovies might easily
be carried in a portmanteau, being, of all the

<p class='c006'>This well-known species weighs near seven
drachms; length about six inches; the bill is
dusky; irides hazel; the crown of the head
ash-colour; round the eye, and between that
and the bill, is black; behind the eyes, surrounding
the back part of the head, bay;

white; the coverts of the wings are chestnut
and black mixed, with a whitish bar across
them; the back a mixture of black and rufous;
quills dusky, with rufous edges; tail
dusky, edged with grey; legs brown. The
bill of the female is lighter; behind the eye a
line of white; the head and whole upper parts
are brown, the under dirty white, dashed with
ash-colour; no black on the chin or neck. In
the country the sparrow exhibits a gloss and
intermixture of colours rarely to be seen in
those inhabiting large towns, which soon become
of a dingy and almost uniform hue,
from the accumulation of dust and smoke upon
their plumage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sparrow is well known in every part
of England; it inhabits the dwellings of the
rich and the poor, taking possession of the
humble thatched cottage in preference to the
sumptuous palace. It is rarely seen far from
the habitation of man, as it delights in the
fruits of his labour; the highest cultivated
parts producing the greatest quantity. It
might be said of this bird, as of some species
of water fowl, which remaining always within
soundings, warn the mariner of his approach
to land; so on the extensive and dreary
mountains, not a sparrow is ever to be seen,
and the sight of one bespeaks some habitation
near. It makes a nest conformable to the
place it chooses for incubation, whether in a
hole of a wall, in thatch, or under the tiles
of a house, or in a window swallow’s nest, it
must conform to the size of the place; but
when the nest is made in a tree, it is of large
size, and covered at top, composed of hay and
straw, lined warmly with feathers and fragments
of thread or worsted, bits of cloth, or
any refuse material of that sort, found about
houses.</p>

<p class='c006'>This accommodation of the structure of the
nest to the locality where it is built, is in no
instance, with which we are acquainted, more
conspicuous than in the proceedings of the
house-sparrow. Dr. Darwin mentions, seemingly
as an extraordinary circumstance, that
“in the trees before Mr. Levet’s house, at
Litchfield, there are annually nests built by
sparrows, a bird which usually builds under
the tiles of houses or the thatch of barns;”
but if he had been acquainted with the works
of Bonnet, he would have learned that in
Switzerland, at least, the sparrow “most usually
(<i>pour l’ordinaire</i>) builds near the tops
of trees,” while its nestling under tiles is an
accidental exception. In the vicinity of London
also, we venture to say that three pair of
sparrows build on trees to one pair that nestle
in holes; and so commonly is this noticed,
that the tree-sparrow is popularly supposed to
be a different species from the house-sparrow.
The tree-sparrow (<i>Passer montanus</i>) of
Yorkshire is indeed a different species, which
lays pale brown eggs without spots; but the
London ones, which build either on trees or
in holes, have not a shade of difference.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of notice, that they always
proportion the quantity of materials to the
size of the nest hole, which is generally
packed close, leaving only a sufficient cavity
for hatching the eggs and rearing the young.
I have one of these nests, for example, which
could almost be hid in the hollow of the
hand, and another, built about a yard from it,
which would fill a hat. When the nest is
built on a tree, however, it is always nearly
of the same dimensions, about a foot in diameter
each way. From the bird nestling
occasionally in holes, it might be imagined
that when it made choice of a tree, it would
be on account of thus obtaining a canopy of
thick boughs to form a roof; but, on the contrary,
sparrows, for the most part, select a
high, exposed branch, as if they were more
anxious to be out of the reach of cats, than
of cold winds. When sparrows build in the
ivied wall of a house, as they often do, they
do not consider the thick clustering of the
leaves above the nest as a sufficiently warm
coping; and in such cases usually, if not
always, construct a dome of straw, though
much more slight than in nests built on the
exposed branches of trees.</p>

<p class='c006'>From its anxiety to procure shelter, the
sparrow indeed seizes upon any convenience it
can find best adapted to its purpose, whether
that be accidental or have been prepared by
some other bird. One very cogent reason for
this appears to be its looking forward prospectively
to the winter, for sparrows occupy their
nests at night throughout the year, and though
they are hardy birds, they require a warm
shelter during severe frosts.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not aware that any contrivance is
resorted to in Britain, to entice birds to build
in particular places, except in the case of the
house-sparrow. In the vicinity of London
more particularly, pots of unglazed delft ware
of a sub-oval shape, with a narrow hole for an
entrance, are fixed upon the walls of houses,
several feet below the eave, and the sparrows
finding a domicile so suited to their habits,
very soon took possession of every pot thus
provided for them. But those who are so
careful to accommodate the sparrows, do it
not because they are fond of their neighbourhood
or their yelping concerts, but to prevent
their nestling under the eaves, where they dig
out the mortar with their strong bills, when
they do not find holes large enough for their
accommodation. It probably never struck
those wise persons, that by thus encouraging
the sparrows to breed, they are promoting the
increase of the race, and unless they multiply
their sparrow pots yearly, they may be almost
certain that the supernumeraries will resort
to eaves nearest their birth-place. In Holland,
square boxes are placed on the house-tops, to
entice the stork (<i>Ardea ciconia</i>) to build;
and for the same purpose it was customary in
France, in Belon’s time, to place wheels there,
a practice said to be still followed in some
parts of Germany.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sparrow lays six eggs of a whitish colour,
spotted with dusky brown or ash-grey,

thickness of the spots; each weighs from
forty-three to forty-eight grains. Accidental
varieties occur, such as white, black, and yellowish.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sparrow Shooting.</i>—If, however, there
are persons who still think the practice of shooting
swallows to be of assistance in acquiring
the art, we will venture to recommend another
mode which is nearly similar, but, in our
opinion, much better. This is, by putting small
pieces of white paper round the necks of sparrows,
or other small birds, by the means of a
hole cut in the middle of the paper, then
throwing a single bird into the air, the young
shooter may deliberately take his aim, for by
this device the flight of the bird is rendered
less rapid and more regular, and at the same
time presents a much better mark for practice,
besides it affords an excellent diversion in
seasons when game cannot be pursued, or in
wet weather from underneath the shelter of a
shed or a barn-door. Some of the first shots in
the kingdom have been perfected by this mode.—<i>Montagu</i>—<i>Art
of Shooting.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Sparrowhawk.</i> (<i>Falconisus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>L’Epuvier</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The length of the male
is twelve inches; that of the female fifteen.
Its bill is blue, furnished with bristles at the
base, which overhang the nostrils; the colour
of the eye is bright orange; the head is flat at
the top, and above each eye is a strong bony
projection, which seems as if intended to secure
it from external injury: from this projection
a few scattered spots of white form a
faint line running backward towards the neck:
the top of the head and all the upper parts of
the body are of a dusky brown colour; on the
back part of the head there is a faint line of
white; the scapulars are marked with two spots
of white on each feather; the greater quill feathers
and the tail are dusky, with four bars of
a darker hue on each; the inner edges of all
the quills are marked with two or more large
white spots; the tips of the tail feathers are
white; the breast, belly, and under coverts of
the wings and thighs are white, beautifully
barred with brown; the throat is faintly streaked
with brown; the legs and feet are yellow;
claws black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The above is the description of a female;
the male differs both in size and colour; the
upper part of his body is of a dark lead colour;
and the bars on his breast are more numerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female builds her nest in hollow trees,
high rocks, or lofty ruins, sometimes in the
old nest of a crow, and generally lays four or
five eggs, spotted with reddish spots at the
longer end.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sparrow-hawk is very numerous in various
parts of the world, from Russia to the
Cape of Good Hope. It is a bold and spirited
bird; but is obedient and docile, and can be
easily trained to hunt partridges and quails; it
makes great destruction among pigeons, young
poultry, and small birds of all kinds, which it
will attack and carry off in the most daring
manner.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Sparrow-owl</span>, <i>s.</i> (<i>Noctua passerina</i>, <span class='sc'>Savigny</span>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>The sparrow owl is a very rare species in
England. In France it is said to frequent
ruined edifices. It makes a nest in the holes
of rocks and walls, and lays five or six eggs,
spotted with yellowish and white. It is said
to fly by day, and to give chace to small birds;
but its principal food is mice. It is said to
build in chimneys in Carniola; and Mr. Edwards
mentions two having been taken in
England by coming down chimneys. In
1808, one was shot by Mr. Comyns, in
North Devon.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Spavin</span>, <i>s.</i> This disease in horses is a bony excrescence, or crust as hard as
a bone, that grows on the inside of the hough.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Bony spavin</i> consists of a small bony enlargement
on the inside of the hock, which
often is not very observable. It occasions,
however, a peculiar kind of lameness, which
cannot well be mistaken, that is, a quick catching
up of the leg, especially in trotting. This
lameness is of course in various degrees, and
sometimes scarcely observable except on first
starting, and sometimes in confirmed and bad
spavins; the lameness diminishes, and sometimes
appears to go off by exercise, but after
resting for some time the horse becomes very
stiff and lame. The only remedy for this
complaint is firing, and blistering immediately
after. The horse should then be turned into
a box for a short time, and afterwards to grass;
in about a month he may be put to work. I
have been informed that introducing a seton
over the diseased part of the hock is now practised
at the Veterinary College, in preference
to firing. I have never tried this remedy,
being satisfied that firing is the best, and indeed
the only remedy where the disease is
curable. The hot iron should be carried
through the skin immediately over, and a little
way into, the bony excrescence.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Bog spavin</i> and <i>thorough pin</i> is a swelling
on the inside of the hock, rather towards the
fore part; the large vein which is so conspicuous
on the inside of the leg passing over it.
It depends either upon a distension, or rupture
of the membranes which form the synovial
cavity, or bursa mucosa, through which the
great flexor tendon passes. The swelling is
soft and yielding to the pressure of the finger,
but rises again as soon as the pressure is
removed. Sometimes, however, there is a
swelling on the outside of the hock also, and
in that case the fluid or synovia which the
swelling contains, may be forced from one to
the other. It is generally produced by hard
work, or violent exertion for a short period,
generally in breaking in a colt and putting him
upon his haunches, as it is termed, at too
early an age. It seldom occasions lameness,
unless considerable, and then makes a horse
go very stiff, especially after working much.
The only remedy is firing, and sufficient rest;
and when it is so considerable as to cause any
degree of stiffness, it is advisable to have
recourse to this operation. It often exists
however in a slight degree, and without occasioning
any inconvenience, and then it is
better to leave it alone.—<i>White.</i></p>

but leaving the threads without the
wound, which is to be closed by stitches and
bandaging. Farriers often apply no ligature,
but content themselves with simply sewing up
the wound, and no ill consequence seems to
ensue. Bitches, after they have been spayed,
become fat, bloated, and spiritless, and commonly
prove short-lived.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Speed of the Horse.</i>—Common report
says that Flying Childers could run a mile in
a minute, but there is no authentic record of
this. He ran over the Round Course of
Newmarket (three miles, six furlongs, and
ninety-three yards) in six minutes and forty
seconds; and the Beacon Course (four miles,
one furlong, and one hundred and thirty-eight
yards), in seven minutes and thirty seconds.
In 1772, a mile was run by Firetail, in one
minute and four seconds. In October 1741,
at the Curragh meeting in Ireland, Mr. Wilde
engaged to ride 127 miles in nine hours. He
performed it in six hours and twenty-one minutes.
He employed ten horses, and allowing
for mounting and dismounting, and a
moment for refreshment, he rode for six hours
at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Mr.
Thornhill, in 1745, exceeded this, for he rode
from Stilton to London and back, and again
to Stilton, being 213 miles, in eleven hours
and thirty-four minutes, which is, after allowing
the least possible time for changing horses,
twenty miles an hour for eleven hours, and
on the turnpike road and uneven ground.
Mr. Shaftoe, in 1762, with ten horses, and
five of them ridden twice, accomplished fifty
miles and a quarter in one hour and forty-nine
minutes. In 1763, Mr. Shaftoe won a
more extraordinary match. He was to procure
a person to ride one hundred miles a day,
on any one horse each day, for twenty-nine
days together, and to have any number of
horses not exceeding twenty-nine: he accomplished
it on fourteen horses, and one day he
rode 160 miles, on account of the tiring of
his first horse. Mr. Hull’s Quibbler, however,
afforded the most extraordinary instance
on record of the stoutness as well as speed of
the race-horse. In December, 1786, he ran
twenty-three miles round the flat at Newmarket,
in fifty-seven minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speed is sportingly applicable to horse,
hound, or greyhound. There are two modes
of trial for speed, according to the present
reformed mode of English racing; the one is
to run a mile, which is termed running for
speed; the other, of going off at score, and
absolutely racing the whole four miles, which
is called running for speed and bottom. Flying
Childers, whose speed was almost proverbial,
went one third of a mile in twenty
seconds. Firetail and Pumpkin ran a mile in
a few seconds more than a minute and a half.
Childers ran the distance of four miles in six
minutes and forty-eight seconds, carrying nine
stone, two pounds; he made a leap of thirty
feet upon level ground; and he covered a
space of twenty-five feet at every stroke when
racing. It was formerly known that any horse
who could run four miles in eight minutes,
would prove a winner of plates: this is, however,
very materially refined, by judicious
crosses in blood, or improvements in training;
as Bay Malton ran four miles over York in
seven minutes, forty-three seconds and a half.
Eclipse ran the same distance over York in
eight minutes, with twelve stone, though
going only at his rate, without any inducement
to speed.—<i>Sporting Directory.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Did a man wish to moralise upon the unrealities
of human expectations, let him hang
over a spillet, and be interested in its success.
Conceive an eternity of line, with a thousand
hooks at given distances; as every snoud is
placed a fathom apart, a person less conversant
with figures than Joe Hume, may guess the
total. This endless continuity of hemp must
be carefully taken up. Do it slowly, and the
thing is worse than a penance to Lough Dergh;
and if you attempt rapidity, the odds are, that
the back-line breaks, and a full hour will
scarcely remedy the mischief.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would puzzle a philosopher to determine
the state of affairs in ten fathom of water; and
if you shoot in foul ground, you will probably
lose the spillet, or, with a world of labour, disentangle
a moiety from rocks and sea-weed.
Should it, however, have escaped those casualties,
after a two hours’ probation, while you
listen to a drimindhu from the skipper, and
the exact state of the herring-market from the
crew, you proceed to raise it. Up it comes—that
vibratory motion announces that a fish is
fast upon the snoud; conjecture is busily at
work, and there is a difference of opinion, whether
‘the deceived one’ be a codling or red
gurnet. It appears—a worthless, rascally, dog-fish!
A succession of line comes in—star-fish,
and, “few and far between,” some solitary
plaices and flounders—at last a victim—heavy
and unresisting. An indistinct glance of a
dark object, broad as a tea-tray, brings the assistant
spilleteer, gaff in hand, to the quarter.
Alas! the turbot in expectation, turns out to
be a ray! Often have I shot a spillet under
favourable circumstances, and in approved
ground, and lost time, hooks, and snouds, and
my whole reward was a boat-load of skates and
dog-fish.—<i>Wild Sports.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>A horse often becomes lame when throwing
out a splent; but that state of the bone
which causes the lameness seldom continues
long; nor does it ever produce permanent
lameness. If any remedy is applied, a blister
is always sufficiently strong. A new method
of treating splents has been lately introduced;
that is, passing a seton under the skin and
immediately over the splent. It is said to be
an improvement. I once tried it in a case of
old bone spavin, but it did no good; nor did
firing, which was tried soon after, though the
hot iron was passed through the skin, and into
the bony excrescence. The old method of
rubbing or bruising a splent, puncturing it, and
rubbing in some blistering preparation, will
often produce a considerable swelling of the
whole limb, and do a great deal of mischief.
Lameness from a splent may sometimes be
removed by placing a pledget of old linen,
wet with goulard or saturnine lotion on it,
and confining it with a bandage kept constantly
wet. I have seen a good effect from
diluted vinegar also.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the <i>mainspring</i> be too strong, in proportion
to that of the hammer, the cock is often
broken for want of resistance, and if the hammer

shut down with too much force, it becomes
difficult to throw it, even with a strong mainspring.
Here, till very lately, most of the
gunmakers were in the dark; as nothing was
more admired in a lock, than the hammer
shutting down with great velocity. This, not
only for the reason already mentioned, is a sad
fault, but the hammer by thus coming down
escapes, in a certain degree, from the influence
of the spring, and, consequently, loses its
pressure on the pan; by which the priming is
not so closely covered, and the hammer is apt
to re-act instead of obeying the mainspring. In
a word let your hammer shut down dull and
fly back smart. The mainspring, to be well
regulated, should at first pull up hard, and
then draw progressively easier: because it requires
an accession of force after it has recovered
the first sudden escape from the scear-spring,
otherwise it will go slow with a flint,
and be liable either to cause a snap, or allow
the cock to be blown back with a detonater.—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>There are two different dogs which usually
pass under this denomination; one being considerably
larger than the other, and known by
the name of the springing spaniel; it is applicable
to every kind of game in any country.</p>

<p class='c006'>The springer is supposed to have originated
in Great Britain, although it is now widely
diffused over every quarter of the globe. He
is much and eagerly sought after in the wild
sports of the East.</p>

<p class='c006'>The true English-bred springing spaniel
differs but little in figure from the setter, except
in size; their chief difference consists in
the former having a larger head than the latter
in proportion to the bulk of his body; they
vary also in a small degree in point of colour,
from red, yellow, or liver colour and white,
which seems to be the invariable standard of
the breed. They are nearly two-fifths less in
height and strength than the setter, their form
being more delicate, their ears longer, very
soft and pliable, covered with a coat of long
waving and silky hair; the nose is red or
black, the latter being the surest mark of high
breeding; the tail is bushy and pendulous,
and is always in motion when employed in
pursuit of game.</p>

<p class='c006'>Differently from other dogs used in shooting,
both the springer and the cocker give
tongue the moment they either smell or see
game; and this gives intimation to the sportsmen,
who generally station themselves on the
skirts of the wood or covert to which woodcocks,
snipes, and pheasants are known to fly
when started.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both this dog and the cocker are frequently
used as finders in greyhound-coursing, and are
no less eager to start a hare, which they pursue
with as much ardour as they do winged
game.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the time the springer is thrown off in
the field, he gives evident proofs of the pleasure
he experiences in being thus employed,
by the perpetual motion of his tail, which is
termed feathering amongst sportsmen; and upon
the increasing vibration of which the experienced
fowler well knows that he is getting
nearer to the object of attraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nearer he approaches the game, the
more energetic the dog becomes in his endeavours
to succeed; tremulous whispers escape
him, as a symptom of doubt; but the moment
this doubt is dispelled, and the game is found,
his clamorous raptures break forth in full
force. He expresses his gratification by loud
and quick barking, which may be relied on as
a proof that he has not sought in vain; leaving
the happy owner exultingly to boast, that
“he is in possession of at least one faithful
domestic, who never tells a lie.”—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Springhalt</span>, <i>s.</i> A lameness by which the horse twitches up his legs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Spring Wagtail</span> (<i>Budytes flava</i>, <span class='sc'>Cuvier</span>), <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>There appears no doubt but many authors
have confounded this species with the grey
wagtail, which we have remarked more fully
in the history of that bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>The male of this species, it is said, possesses
a few black spots on the throat, but
such a mark we have never observed in more
than a hundred specimens. It must therefore
be rare, if not a mistake, in describing the grey
wagtail for this. If no other mark of distinction
were to be found but the length and
straitness of the hind claw in this, it would
be sufficient to know it from the grey wagtail,
which is very short and crooked. The
tail of this bird is also an inch shorter, and
has only two feathers on each side, partly
white. The under parts of the male are of a
much fuller yellow, and the upper parts never
possess any of the cinereous colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The spring wagtail visits us about the time
the other departs, and migrates again in September.
It frequents arable land, especially
in the more champaign parts; sometimes uncultivated
ground interspersed with furze; it
is also partial to bean fields; in all such
places it breeds, and does not seem to regard
water so much as either of the other species.
It is said to be found in Russia and Siberia in
summer, and to continue in France the whole
year.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Within the memory of some of the old persons
residing in Richmond Park, squirrels
were in such vast numbers, that parties of
fifty or sixty persons have come from the
metropolis and its neighbourhood, for the purpose
of killing them. They were furnished
with short sticks, with lead at one end, with
which they knocked the animals down. These
squirrel hunts occasioned many fights with
the keepers, in one of which a keeper, of the
name of Bishop, was nearly killed. The
squirrels were in consequence destroyed, and
it is now but seldom that one is seen.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'><i>Cat and Squirrels.</i>—A boy has taken
three little young squirrels in their nest, or
drey as it is called in these parts. These
small creatures he put under the care of a
cat who had lately lost her kittens, and finds
that she nurses and suckles them with the
same assiduity and affection as if they were
her own offspring. This circumstance corroborates
my suspicion, that the mention of exposed
and deserted children being nurtured
by female breasts of prey who had lost their
young, may not be so improbable an incident
as many have supposed; and therefore may
be a justification of those authors who have
gravely mentioned what some have deemed
to be a wild and improbable story.</p>

<p class='c006'>So many persons went to see the little
squirrels suckled by a cat, that the foster
mother became jealous of her charge, and in
pain for their safety; and therefore hid them
over the ceiling, where one died. This circumstance
shows her affection for these fondlings,
and that she supposes the squirrels to
be her own young. Thus hens, when they
have hatched ducklings, are equally attached
to them as if they were their own chickens.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The squirrel’s nest is not only called a drey
in Hampshire, but also in other counties; in
Suffolk it is called a bay. The word “drey,”
though now provincial, I have met with in
some of our old writers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the north of Hampshire a great portion
of the squirrels have white tails. None of
this variety, as far as I can learn, reach the
London Market. I was much surprised at
hearing from a man who kept a bird and cage
shop in London, that not less than twenty
thousand squirrels are annually sold there for
the <i>menus plaisirs</i> of cockneys, part of which
come from France, but the greater number
are brought in by labourers to Newgate and
Leadenhall markets, where any morning during
the season four or five hundred might be
bought. He said that he himself sold annually
about seven hundred: and, he added, that
about once in seven years the breed of squirrels
entirely fails, but that in other seasons they
are equally prolific. The subject was introduced
by his answering to a woman who came
in to buy a squirrel, that he had not had one
that season, but before that time in the last
season he had sold five hundred. It appears
that the mere manufacture of squirrel cages
for Londoners is no small concern.—<i>Mitford</i>—<i>White.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_506.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The stag or hart, whose female is called the
hind, and the young a calf, differs in size and
in horns from a fallow deer. He is much larger,
and his horns round, whereas, in the fallow
species, they are broad and palmated. By
these the animal’s age is ascertained. During
the first year the stag has no horns, but a horny
excrescence, which is short and rough, and covered
with a thin hairy skin, the next year the
horns are single and straight, in the third they
have two antlers, three the fourth, four the
fifth, and five the sixth year, but this number
is not always certain, for sometimes there are
more, and often, less. After the sixth year
the antlers do not always increase, and although
in number they may amount six or seven on
each side, yet the animal’s age is then estimated
rather from the size of the antlers, and the
thickness of the branch which sustains them,
than from their variety. These horns, large as
they seem, are, notwithstanding, shed every
year, and new ones assume their place. The
old horns are of a firm solid texture, and are
extensively employed in making handles for
knives and other instruments. But, while
young, nothing can be more soft or tender, and
the animal, as if conscious of his own imbecility,
at those times, instantly upon shedding
his former horns, retires from the rest of his
species, and hides himself in solitudes and
thickets, never venturing out to pasture except
by night. During this time, which most usually
happens in the spring, the new horns are
very tender, and have a quick sensibility of any
external impression. When the old horn has
fallen off, the new one does not begin to appear
immediately, but the bones of the skull are
seen covered only with a transparent periosteum
or skin, which covers the bones of all
animals. After a short time, however, the
skin begins to swell, and to form a sort of tumour,
which contains a great deal of blood,
and then it is covered with a downy substance,
that to the touch resembles velvet, and which
appears of nearly the same colour with the
rest of the animal’s hair. This tumour daily
increases from the point, like the graft of a
tree, and, rising by degrees from the head,
shoots out the antlers from either side, so that
in a short time, in proportion as the animal is
in condition, the entire horns are completed,
but it should be observed, that the substance
of which the horns are composed, begins to
harden at the bottom, while the upper part
remains soft and still continues growing;
whence it appears that the horns of deer
grow differently from those of sheep or cows,
which latter always are seen to increase from
the bottom. When, however, the horns have
completed their full growth, the extremities
then acquire solidity. The velvet-like covering,
with its blood-vessels, dries up, and the
former then begins to fall, and this the animal
hastens by rubbing its antlers against the trees
of the forest. In this manner the whole external
surface being stripped off by degrees, the
horns acquire their complete hardness, expansion,
and beauty. It is also said that some
hinds have horns.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be a vain task to inquire into the
cause of the annual production of these horns;
it is sufficient to observe, that if a stag be emasculated
when the horns are fallen off, they will
never grow again; and, on the contrary, if the
same operation is performed when they are on,
they will never fall off. If only one side is
emasculated, he will want the horn on that
side.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old stags usually shed their horns first,
which generally happens towards the latter
end of February or the beginning of March.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such as are between five and six years old
shed their horns about the middle or latter
end of March; those still younger in the
month of April; and the youngest of all not
till the middle or latter end of May.</p>

<p class='c006'>They generally shed them in pools of water,
whither they retire from the heat, and this
has given rise to the opinion of their always
hiding their horns. These rules, though true
in general, are yet subject to many variations,
and it is well known that a severe winter
retards the shedding of the horns. A short
time after they have gained their horns, they
begin to feel the impression of the rut.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old ones are the most forward, and
about the end of August or beginning of
September, they quit their thickets and return
to the mountain or plain in order to seek the
hind, to whom they call with a loud tremulous
note. At this time their neck is swollen—they
appear bold and ferocious—fly from
country to country—strike with their horns
against the trees and other obstacles—and
continue restless and fierce until they have
found the female, who at first flies from them,
but is at last overtaken.</p>

<p class='c006'>When two stags contend for the same female,
however timorous they may appear at
other times, they then seem agitated with an
uncommon degree of ardour; they paw up
the earth, and menace their opponent with
their horns, bellowing with all their force, and
striking in a desperate manner against each
other, seeming determined upon death or victory.
This combat continues till one of them
is defeated or flies, and it oftentimes happens
that the victor is obliged to fight several of
these battles before he becomes the undisturbed
master of the field. The old ones are
generally the conquerors upon these occasions,
as they have more strength and greater courage,
and they are preferred by the hind to
the younger, the latter being more feeble and
less ardent.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this manner the stag continues to range
from one to the other for three weeks, the
time the rut continues, during which he
scarcely eats, sleeps, or rests, but continues to
pursue, to combat, and enjoy. At the end of
this period of madness, for such in this animal
it seems to be, the creature that was before
fat, sleek, and glossy, becomes lean, feeble,
and timid. He then retires from the herd to
seek replenishment and repose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stag or red deer is common in Europe,
Barbary, the north of Asia, and North America;
it abounds in the southern parts of Siberia,
where it grows to an immense size, but
is now extirpated in Russia. It lives in herds,
and there is generally one male which is supreme
in each herd. The colour of the stag
is generally a reddish brown, with some black
and white about the face, and a black line
down the hinder part of the neck between the
shoulders, and the belly white. Sometimes
their colour is a pale yellow brown, sometimes
a blackish brown, and lastly, instances occasionally
occur of stags being found entirely
white.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stag possesses a fine eye, an acute
smell, and excellent ear, like that of the cat
and the owl; the eye of the stag contracts in
the light, and dilates in the dark, but with this
difference, that the contraction and dilatation
are horizontal, while in the first mentioned
animals they are vertical.</p>

<p class='c006'>When deer are thirsty, they plunge their
noses, like some horses, very deep under water
while in the act of drinking, and continue
them in that situation for a considerable time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of teeth of the various species
of deer and the antelope tribe, is generally
thirty-two, namely, eight cutting teeth in the
lower jaw, six molar teeth on each side of
these, and six molar teeth on each side in
the upper jaw; but there are frequent exceptions
to this rule.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cry of the hind or female is not so
loud as that of the male, and is never excited
but by apprehension for herself or her young.
It need scarcely be mentioned that she has
no horns, or that she is more feeble or unfit
for hunting than the male. When once she
has conceived she separates from the males,
and then they both herd apart. The time of
gestation continues eight months and a few
days, and they seldom produce more than one
at a birth. Their usual season for bringing
forth is about the month of May, or the
beginning of June. They take the greatest
care to secrete their young in the most obscure
thickets, nor is the caution without
reason, as many creatures are their formidable
enemies. The eagle, the falcon, the wolf,
the dog, and all the rapacious family of the
cat kind, are continually seeking to discover
her retreat. But what is more unnatural
still, the stag himself is a professed enemy,
and she is obliged to use all her arts to conceal
her young from him, as from the most
dangerous of her pursuers. At this season,
therefore, the courage of the male seems
transferred to the female; she defends her
young against her less formidable opponents
by force, and, when pursued by the hunter,
she offers herself to mislead him from the
principal object of his concern. She flies before
the hounds for half the day, and then
returns to her offspring, whose life she has
thus preserved at the hazard of her own.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those persons who are fond of the pastime
of hunting have their peculiar terms for the
different objects of their pursuit. Thus the
stag is called, the first year, a <i>calf</i> or <i>hind
calf</i>, the second a <i>knobber</i>, the third a <i>brock</i>,
the fourth a <i>staggard</i>, the fifth a <i>stag</i>, the
sixth a <i>hart</i>. The female is called, the first
year, a <i>calf</i>, the second a <i>hearse</i>, the third a
<i>hind</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Britain the stag is become less common
than formerly, its excessive viciousness during
the rutting season inducing most people to
dispense with this species, and rear the fallow
deer, which is of a more placid nature, in its
stead. Some attempts have, indeed, been
made to render stags domestic, by treating
them with the same gentleness as the Laplanders
do their rein-deer; and it appears, in
the Isle of France, where the Portuguese had
introduced the European breed, they had so
far succeeded, by degrees, as to render them
quite domestic, many of the inhabitants keeping
large flocks of them; but when the French
took possession of that island, they destroyed
most of these domesticated stags. Valmont
de Bromere asserts that he saw in Germany,
a set, or attelage, consisting of six stags, that
were perfectly obedient to the curb and to the
whip; and in the magnificent stables of Chantilly,
in the year 1770, there were two stags
that were occasionally harnessed to a small
chariot, in which they drew two persons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stags are still found wild in the Highlands
of Scotland, in herds of four or five hundred
together, ranging at full liberty over the vast
hills of the north, and some of them grow to
a great size: Pennant says, upon the authority
of Mr. Farquharson, that one of these wild
stags weighed three hundred and fourteen
pounds, exclusive of the entrails, head, and
skin. Formerly the great Highland chieftains
used to hunt with all the magnificence of
eastern monarchs, assembling four or five
thousand of their clan, who drove the deer into
the toils, or to the station their lairds had
placed themselves in. But as the chace was
frequently used as a pretence for collecting
their vassals for rebellious purposes, an act
was passed prohibiting any assembly of this
kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stags are likewise met with on the moors
that border on Cornwall and Devonshire, and
Ireland, on the mountains of Kerry, where
they add greatly to the magnificence of the
romantic scenery of the lakes of Killarney.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Stags are mostly kept in parks, with fallow
deer. Dr. Johnson describes them as not
exceeding the common deer in size, and that
their flesh is of equal flavour. From a stag
that had been committing depredations on the
farmers’ corn during a whole summer, and
which was accidentally hunted and killed,
after a long run, a haunch weighing forty-six
pounds, was allowed by very competent judges
to be the highest flavoured and fattest venison
they had ever tasted. The stag’s age is partly
known by the horns, which he begins to shed
about the end of February, and the new horns
are complete and polished in July or August:
at six years, the antlers amount to six or seven
on each side; their number is uncertain, nor
can the years be precisely ascertained beyond
that period, as the new horns come like those
last shed. The eye of the stag is peculiarly
beautiful, soft, and sparkling, and is, for these
attributes, frequently alluded to in Eastern
poetry; he hears quickly, and his sense of
smelling is highly perfect; his powers of leaping
are often astonishingly exerted during the
chase, and in the New Forest is a celebrated
spot called the Deer Leap, where a stag was
once shot, and in the agony of death, collecting
his strength, gave a bound which so surprised
those that saw it, that it is commemorated
by two posts, fixed at the extremity of
the leap: the space between them is something
more than eighteen yards. The stag’s
rutting season is in August, and continues
about three weeks, when he becomes a dangerous
animal: he then frequents rivers or
pools of water, to cool his ardour; he swims
with great power and facility, and to this
element he always retreats, when hard pressed
by the hounds. The hind, at the expiration
of eight months and a few days, produces seldom
more than one young, which she resolutely
protects from every enemy, and carefully conceals
from the stag, one of the worst. During
the whole summer the fawn never quits the
dam; and in winter the stags and hinds of
all ages keep together in herds, which are
more or less numerous, according to the mildness
or rigour of the season. They separate
in the spring; the hinds retire to bring forth,
while none but the young ones remain together.
Stags are gregarious, delight to graze
in company, and are separated but by danger
or necessity.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>While traversing a low range of moors, an
incident occurred which, at this season, was
unaccountable. A red-and-white setter pointed
at the top of a little glen. The heathy banks
on both sides of a mountain rivulet undulated
gently from the stream, and caused a dipping
of the surface; the ground seemed a favourable
haunt for grouse, and our dogs were beating it
with care. Observing the setter drop, his
companions backed, and remained steady, when
suddenly Hero rose from his couchant attitude,
and next moment a wild deer of enormous size
and splendid beauty crossed before the dog and
sprang the birds he had been pointing. The
apparition of the animal, so little expected, and
so singularly and closely introduced to our
view, occasioned a sensation I had never hitherto
experienced. I rushed up the bank;
unembarrassed by our presence, the noble deer
swept past us in a light and graceful canter, at
the short distance of some seventy or eighty
yards. I might have fired at and annoyed him—but
on a creature so powerful small shot
could have produced little effect, and none but
a cockney, under such circumstances, would
waste a charge. To teaze without a chance
of bringing down the gallant beast, would have
been a species of useless mischief, meriting a
full month upon the tread-mill. I gazed after
him as he gradually increased his distance; his
antlers were expanded as fully as my arms
would extend; his height was magnificent, and
compared with fallow-deer he seemed a giant
to a dwarf. The sun beamed upon his deep
bay side, as he continued describing a circular
course over the flat surface of the moor, till
reaching a rocky opening leading to the upper
hills, he plunged into the ravine, and we lost
sight of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>What could have driven the red deer so low
upon the heath was marvellous. Excepting
when disturbed by a solitary hunter, or a herdsman
in pursuit of errant cattle, or driven from
the summit of the hills by snow and storm,
those deer are rarely seen below the Alpine
heights they inhabit. But the leisure pace of
the beautiful animal we saw to-day, proved
that he had not been alarmed in his lair, and
led one almost to fancy, that in freakish mood,
he had abandoned his mountain home to take
a passing glance at men and things beneath
him.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I will not pretend to describe the anxious,
nay agonising hour that I passed in this highland
ambuscade. The deep stillness of the
waste was not broken even by the twittering
of a bird. From the place where I lay concealed,
I commanded a view of the defile for
the distance of some eighty yards, and my eye
turned to the path by which I expected the
deer to approach, until to gaze longer pained
me. My ear was equally engaged; the smallest
noise was instantly detected, and the ticking
of my watch appeared sharper and louder
than usual. As time wore on my nervousness
increased. Suddenly a few pebbles fell—my
heart beat faster—but it was a false alarm.
Again, I heard a faint sound, as if a light foot
pressed upon loose shingle—it was repeated—by
Saint Hubert, it is the deer! they have entered
the gorge of the pass, and approach the
rock that covers me, in a gentle canter!</p>

<p class='c006'>To sink upon one knee and cock both barrels
was a moment’s work. Reckless of danger,
the noble animals, in single file, galloped
down the narrow pathway. The hart led the
way, followed by the doe, and the old stag
brought up the rear. As they passed me at
the short distance of twenty paces, I fired at
the leader, and, as I thought, with deadly aim;
but the ball passed over his back, and splintered
the rock beyond him. The report rang
over the waste, and the deer’s surprise was
evinced by the tremendous rush they made to
clear the defile before them. I selected the
stag for my second essay; eye and finger kept
excellent time, as I imagined—I drew the
trigger—a miss by every thing unfortunate!
The bullet merely struck a tyne from his antler,
and, excepting this trifling graze, he went
off at a thundering pace, uninjured.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The deer had separated—the hart and doe
turned suddenly to the right, and were fired
at by my cousin, without effect. The stag
went right a-head; and while I still gazed after
him, a flash issued from a hollow in the hill,
the sharp report of Hennessey’s piece succeeded,
and the stag sprang full six feet from
the ground, and tumbling over and over repeatedly,
dropped upon the bent-grass with a
rifle-bullet in his heart.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In addition to a herd of fallow deer, amounting
to about one thousand six hundred, which
are kept in Richmond Park, there is generally
a stock of from forty to fifty red deer.
Some stags from the latter are selected every
year, and sent to Swinley, in order to be hunted
by the king’s stag-hounds. When a stag,
which has been hunted for three or four seasons,
is returned to the park, to end his days
there, he is generally more fierce and dangerous
than any of the others at a particular season
of the year. At that time it is sometimes
not safe to approach him: and the keepers inform
me that they have been obliged to fire at
them with buck shot, when they have been
attacked by them. They account for this ferocity,
by the circumstance of the deer having
been much handled, and consequently rendered
more familiar with, and less afraid of, those
whom they would naturally shun. It is sometimes
very difficult to take stags for hunting.
One fine stag was so powerful, and offered so
much resistance, that two of his legs were broken
in endeavouring to secure him, and he
was obliged to be killed. One who had shown
good sport in the royal hunt, was named ‘Sir
Edmund,’ by his late Majesty, in consequence
of Sir Edmund Nagle having been in at the
‘take’ after a long chase. This stag lived some
years afterwards in the park; and it is a curious
fact that he died the very same day on
which Sir Edmund Nagle died. This deer
herded with the cows, probably from having
been so long separated from his usual companions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Does are longer lived than bucks. One
doe in Richmond Park lived to be twenty years
old; and there are other instances of their
having attained the same age.</p>

<p class='c006'>A curious circumstance lately occurred, respecting
the red deer in the park in question.
In the year 1825, not a single calf was dropped
by any of the hinds, though they had bred
freely the preceding, and did the same in the
subsequent year. I find an event recorded in
the ‘Journal of a Naturalist,’ as having happened
in the same year in regard to cows. It
is there stated that, for many miles round the
residence of the author, scarcely any female
calves were born. This diminution of the usual
breed of deer, and the increase of sex in another
animal, is not a little remarkable.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Of the stag’s longevity much has been
asserted, which latter observations have refuted,
and upon the received maxim, that
animals live seven times the number of years
that bring them to perfection, and this requiring
six to arrive at its maturity, the stag’s
age may be fixed at nearly forty years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the stag’s courage, when his personal
safety requires it, the combat promoted by
William, Duke of Cumberland, many years
since, in an area where a stag was inclosed with
a hunting tiger, and which made so resolute
a defence that the tiger was at length obliged
to give up, is a faithful record. It was in
Ascot race week, and this novelty attracted
an additional concourse of people. On a lawn
by the road-side, a space was fenced in with
very strong toiling, fifteen feet high, into
which an old stag was turned, and shortly
after the tiger was led in, hoodwinked, by two
blacks who had the care of him, and his eyes
and himself at once set at liberty. The instant
he saw the deer, he crouched down on
his belly, and creeping like a house-cat at a
mouse, watched an opportunity of safely seizing
his prey. The stag, however, warily turned
as he turned, and this strange antagonist still
found himself opposed by his formidable brow
antlers. In vain the tiger attempted to turn his
flanks, the stag had too much generalship, and
this cautious warfare lasted until it became tedious,
when his royal highness enquired, if, by
irritating the tiger, the catastrophe of the
combat might not be hastened; he was told it
might be dangerous, but it was ordered to be
done; the keepers went to the tiger, and did
as they were ordered, when immediately, instead
of attacking the deer, with a furious and
elastic bounce, he sprang at, and cleared the
toiling that enclosed him; great indeed was
the confusion amongst the affrighted multitude,
every one imagining him or herself the
destined victim to the tiger’s rage, who, regardless
of their fears, or their persons, crossed
the road, and rushed into the opposite wood.</p>

<p class='c006'>It happened a herd of fallow deer were
feeding not far from the scene of action, on
the haunch of one of them he instantly fastened,
and brought it to the ground. His
keepers, to whom he was perfectly familiarised,
for some time hesitated to go near him;
at length they ventured, cut the deer’s throat,
and separating the haunch he had seized,
which he never left from his hold for a moment,
hoodwinked, and led him away with it in
his mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stag Hunting.</i>—I hunted two winters at
Turin: but their hunting, you know, is no
more like ours, than is the hot meal you
there stand up to eat to the English breakfast
you sit down to here. Were I to describe
their manner of hunting, their infinity
of dogs, their number of huntsmen, their relays
of horses, their great saddles, great bits,
and jack-boots, it would be no more to our present
purpose than the description of a wild
boar chase in Germany, or the hunting of
jackalls in Bengal. <i>C’est une chasse magnifique,
et voilà tout.</i> However, to give
you an idea of their huntsmen, I must tell
you that one day the stag (which is very unusual)
broke cover, and left the forest; a circumstance
which gave as much pleasure to me
as displeasure to all the rest—it put every
thing into confusion. I followed one of the
huntsmen, thinking he knew the country best;
but it was not long before we were separated:
the first ditch we came to stopped him. I,
eager to go on, hallooed out to him, “<i>Allons
piqueur, sautez done.</i>” “<i>Non pardi</i>,”
replied he, very coolly, “<i>c’est un double
fossé—je ne saute pas des double fossés</i>.”
There was also an odd accident the same day,
even to the king himself, you may think interesting;
besides it was the occasion of a <i>bon
mot</i> worth your hearing.—The king, eager in
the pursuit, rode into a bog, and was dismounted:
he was not hurt,—he was soon on
his legs, and we were all standing round him.
One of his old generals, who was at some distance
behind, no sooner saw the king off his
horse, but he rode up full gallop to know the
cause, “<i>Qu’est ce que c’est? qu’est ce
que c’est?</i>” cries the old general, and in he
tumbles into the same bog. Count Kevenhuller,
with great humour, replied, pointing
to the place, “<i>Voilà ce que c’est! voilà ce
que c’est!</i>”—<i>Le Keux</i>—<i>Jesse</i>—<i>Wild

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_511.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The stag-hound is now the largest and most
powerful of all the dogs which go under the
general term of hound. He is held higher in
estimation than any other dog of chase, and
has a most commanding and dignified aspect,
blended with every mark of intellectual mildness.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been asserted by the most celebrated
naturalists, that the hound, harrier, turnspit,
water-dog, and spaniel, are originally of the
same race; and there seem to be strong reasons
for believing this to be the case, as their
figures and instinctive properties are nearly
allied in all of these kinds; the principal difference
consisting in the length of their legs
and the size of their ears, which are in all of
them soft in their texture and pendulous.
The hound and harrier are supposed to be the
natives of Britain, France, and Germany, an
opinion which is attended with some degree
of reason, for when transported to warmer
climates they quickly degenerate.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems extremely probable that this large,
strong, and bony hound was the primeval
stock from which all the collateral branches
of this race have descended, and that all deviations
from the original stem have been the
result of crosses and improvements, during
many centuries, by those skilled in rearing
and breeding dogs of the chase, and varied in
size and strength, according to the particular
sport for which they are intended. At the
present day there cannot be a doubt but that
the practical breeder, by judicious crosses, can
either enlarge or diminish the stature and
strength of his pack in the course of three or
four generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stag-hounds exclusively devoted to
that sport, in the royal establishment of this
country, it is well known, have been an improved
cross between the old English southern
hound and the fleeter foxhound, grafted upon
the bloodhound.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Things gradually continue thus to improve
in proportion as the face of the country becomes
more cultivated, till animals of the
chace are greatly reduced in number, so
much so, that even the stag is now but seldom
seen in a state of nature in this country,
decreasing as the sequestered places of its
abode become fewer. They are now only
to be met with in a state of unrestrained freedom
in those extensive moors upon the borders
of Cornwall and Devonshire, and in some
places of the Highlands of Scotland, and the
mountains of Kerry in Ireland, in which last
place they add greatly to the beauty and magnificence
of the justly celebrated Lake of
Killarney, where they are pursued with hound
and horn.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>There is a fine breed of buck-hounds in
Richmond Park, and their sagacity is very extraordinary.
In taking the deer, according to
annual custom, either for the royal hunt or for
the fattening paddocks, a stag or a buck, which
has been previously fixed upon, is ridden out
of the herd by two or three of the keepers in
succession, each of whom is closely followed
by a hound, the young dogs only being kept in
slips. As soon as the deer has been separated
from his companions, the dogs have the requisite
signal given to them, and they immediately
follow in pursuit. The scene is then
highly interesting. A strong deer will afford
a very long chase, but when he comes to bay
the dogs generally seize him by the throat or
ears; the keepers come up, take him by the
horns, and after having strapped his hind and
fore legs together, put him into a cart which
follows for the purpose, and he is then disposed
of as he may be wanted. I have seen an active
young keeper throw himself from his horse
upon a deer at bay, which he had come up to
at full gallop, and hold his horns till assistance
arrived. Some danger, however, attends this
sport; as, when a deer has been hard pressed,
I have seen him, in more than one instance,
suddenly turn upon the horsemen and injure
the horses, and in one case wound the leg of
the horseman. The dogs are so well trained,
and are so soon made aware which buck is intended
to be caught, that they seldom make a
mistake, even if the deer regains the herd after
having been driven from it, but press him
through it, till they have again separated him
from it. It is well known that when a hard
pressed deer tries to rejoin his companions,
they endeavour to avoid and get away from
him as much as possible, or try to drive him
away with their horns. So severe is the chase
in Richmond Park in taking deer, especially
when the ground is wet, that three or four
good horses may be tired by a single horseman
in one day’s deer taking, if each deer is
ridden out of the herd, and followed till he is
taken. When dogs are in slips, the man who
holds them merely rides as near as he can to
the person who is endeavouring to single out
the deer, and awaits his signal for slipping the
dog. These dogs who are a large, rough sort
of greyhound, and very powerful and sagacious,
are soon taught not to injure the deer when
they come to them. The cry of ‘hold them,’
made use of by the keepers in urging them
forward, seems to be perfectly understood by
the dogs.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_513.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of this bird is somewhat less
than nine inches. The bill is straight, sharp-pointed,
and of a yellowish brown; in old
birds deep yellow; the nostrils are surrounded
by a prominent rim; the eyes are brown;
the whole plumage is dark, glossed with green,
blue, purple, and copper, but each feather is
marked at the end with a pale yellow spot;
the wing-coverts are edged with yellowish-brown;
the quill and tail-feathers dusky, with
light edges; the legs are of a reddish-brown.
From the striking similarity, both in form
and manners, observable between this bird
and its congeners, we have no scruple in
removing it from its usual place, as it evidently
forms a connecting link between them,
and in a variety of points seems equally
allied to both. Few birds are more generally
known than the stare, it being an inhabitant
of almost every climate; and as it is a familiar
bird, and easily trained in a state of captivity,
its habits have been more frequently
observed than those of most other birds. The
female makes an artless nest in the hollows
of trees, rocks, or old walls, and sometimes
in cliffs overhanging the sea; she lays four or
five eggs, of a pale greenish-ash colour; the
young birds are of a dusky-brown colour, till
the first moult. In the winter season these
birds fly in vast flocks, and may be known at
a great distance by their whirling mode of
flight, which Buffon compares to a sort of
vortex, in which the collective body performs
a uniform circular revolution, and at the same
time continues to make a progressive advance.
The evening is the time when the stares assemble
in the greatest numbers, and betake
themselves to the fens and marshes, where
they roost among the reeds; they chatter
much in the evening and morning, both when
they assemble and disperse. So attached are
they to society, that they not only join those
of their own species, but also birds of a different
kind, and are frequently seen in company
with red-wings, fieldfares, and even with
crows, jackdaws, and pigeons. Their principal
food consists of worms, snails, and caterpillars;
they likewise eat various kinds of
grain, seeds, and berries, and are said to be
particularly fond of cherries. In a confined
state they eat small pieces of raw flesh, bread
soaked in water, &amp;c.; are very docile, and
may easily be taught to repeat short phrases,
or whistle tunes with great exactness, and in
this state acquire a warbling superior to their
native song.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The time to shoot starlings by wholesale is
just before the dusk of the evening, when they
come down to roost among the reeds. Here
they assemble in swarms, that darken the
air; and for some time keep up a chatter,
which even surpasses that of Frenchmen in
their warmest political debates.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having swept down some dozens with your
duck-gun, let their heads be immediately
pulled off; as this will, in a great degree,
prevent their having a bitter taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>Starlings are very good when stewed with
rice, or made into a curry.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Before I conclude under the head of starlings,
I must ask leave to become my own
trumpeter, in order to name a shot that I
made at these birds, which will give some
idea as to the manner in which they swarm
together. Happening, in the early part of last
winter, to have put my punt afloat on Lord
Rodney’s pond, at Alresford, I loaded my new
double swivel-gun with a pound of small shot
in each barrel, and a little before day-light
paddled across to a retired part of the pond,
where the reeds were literally swarming with
these birds. Having placed the punt “stern
on,” so as to command the eastern light, and
shoot well clear of the reeds, I gave a little
signal, as previously agreed on, to Mr. Macilwain
(who, with Captain Hill, was in another
punt behind) to discharge both barrels of my
little double gun. On hearing this report up
sprung the whole army, consisting I should
say of every starling in Hampshire, and
making the valley echo like a peal of thunder.
No sooner had they cleared the reeds
than I opened my battery, and cut such a lane
through them, as I could scarcely have thought
possible, and the quantity of feathers which
came flying back to leeward, I could compare
to nothing but a fall of black snow. What
number were killed and wounded we never
could ascertain, from the extreme difficulty of
getting the birds that fell among the reeds
and quagmires, but we fairly bagged two hundred
and forty-three, as fast as they could be
picked up, and the workmen, when the reeds
were cut down, declared that they found between
two and three hundred more; for this,
however, I have only their word, though there
is no reason to doubt it, as we all felt confident
that at least five hundred fell in this
one volley.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

which purpose they are equal to the minnow,
or superior in pond fishing for perch; they
may be taken with the least sized hook, and
a bit of small red worm, and are found in
little inlets of streams, and also in stagnated
waters. Walton considers the stickleback
preferable to the minnow, as being capable of
whirling round quicker, which is the perfection
of this sort of fishing: to acquire this velocity,
the hook is to be put in at the mouth
and out at the tail, and having first tied him
with white thread a little above the tail, and
placed him in such a manner on the hook as
he is likely to turn quick, his mouth is then
sewed up to the line; should he not whirl so
speedily as is wished, the tail should be more
or less turned towards the inner part, or side
of the hook, or put somewhat more crooked
or straight on the hook, until it turns both

to the seat of injury. Occasionally, dislocation
of the patella has occurred, and the

surgeon is here requisite. The muscles of
the inside of the thigh, generally, have sometimes
been sprained; this may be detected by

<p class='c006'>This animal, which is equally agile and
mischievous with the weasel in pursuit and
destruction of the hare, and all other sorts of
game, poultry, and eggs, has, from its habits
and the small difference in shape from the
weasel, been often described under the same
denomination. Its height is about two inches;
the tail five and a half, very hairy, and at the
points tipped with black; the edges of the
ears and ends of the toes are of a yellowish
white; in other respects it perfectly resembles
the weasel in colour and form. In the
most northern parts of Europe the stoat regularly
changes its colour in winter, and becomes
perfectly white, except the end of the
tail, which remains invariably black. It is
then called the ermine: the fur is valuable,
and sold in the country where caught, from
two to three pounds sterling per hundred.
The animal is either taken in traps, made of
two flat stones, or shot with blunt arrows.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stoat is sometimes found white during
the winter season in Great Britain, and is
then commonly called the white weasel. Its
fur, however, having neither the thickness,
the closeness, nor the whiteness, of those which
come from Siberia, is, with us, of little value.</p>

<p class='c006'>To destroy these worst of all four-footed
vermin to game in its infant state, the following
mode is recommended:—Provide small
square-made steel traps, with a small chain
and iron peg to fix them down; get two
drachms of musk, shoot some small birds, and
dip the tail of these birds in the musk; tie one
on the plate of each trap, and set in the hedges,
or where it is suspected they frequent: this
will soon reduce the number, should it be ever
so considerable: if it so happen, that no musk
is immediately to be got, the trap must be
baited with a bit of rabbit; and it should be
remembered that this bait cannot be too stale.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some time since, as Mr. Clarke, of Horndean,
was going a few miles on foot, in the
forest of Bere, to visit a friend, he observed a
hare come into the green road before him,
which seemed to be listening, and looking
back for something which pursued her. He
stood still, and hearing no dog, was curious to
discover the cause of her alarm; when, to his
great surprise, he discovered the object of it to
be a small yellow red and white stoat, which
hunted her footsteps with the utmost precision.
He, wishing to know if so diminutive
an animal could have a chance of coping with
the great speed of the hare, retreated to a
holm-bush hard by, where he was an attentive
observer of this silent hunt for near two
hours, during which, he is certain to have
seen both hare and stoat at least forty times.
They were frequently gone for five or ten minutes;
but the hare, still unwilling to leave
the place where she was found, came round
again, and her little pursuer sometimes close
at her heels. Towards the end of this remarkable
chase, which became uncommonly
interesting, the hare took advantage of the
thickest covert the place afforded, and made
use of all her cunning and strength to escape,
but without effect; till at length, wearied out
by the perseverance of the stoat, Mr. C. heard
her cry for some time.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, the cries coming from one point,
he concluded she was become the victim of
the chase; on which he went to the spot,
where he found the hare quite dead, and the
stoat so intently fastened on her neck, as not
to perceive his approach. The stoat, in its
turn, now fell a victim to Mr. C’s stick; after
which, he proceeded with both hare and stoat
to the house of his friend.—<i>Sporting

<p class='c006'><i>Stomach of Birds.</i>—The stomach of birds
forms them into two distinct natural classes:
those with cartilaginous stomachs, covered with
very strong muscles, called a gizzard; and
those with membranaceous stomachs, more resembling
that of carnivorous quadrupeds. The
former is given to birds whose principal food
is grain and seeds of various kinds, or other
hard substances that require much friction to
comminute, to assist which gravel is necessary;
the latter is given to birds which feed
upon flesh or fish, and whose digestion is accelerated
more by the gastric juice than by the
action of the stomach. Those of the first class
digest or retain every substance swallowed;
and those which eject or disgorge innutritious
matter unavoidably taken in, such as feathers,
fur, bones, &amp;c., belong to the second class; as
is conspicuous in the falcon (<i>Falconidæ</i>,
<span class='sc'>Leach</span>), and owl (<i>Strigidæ</i>, <i>Leach</i>), and
others that feed on fish. Granivorous birds
seem to possess a power of retaining the small
stones taken into the gizzard, or evacuating
them when they become polished and less useful,
but cannot disgorge them. In a state of
nature the quantity of gravel taken in must be
regulated, no doubt, by the sensation of the
stomach; but, extraordinary as it may seem,
in domesticated animals those instinctive faculties
are deranged. We have known instances
where the whole cavity of the gizzard
has been filled with gravel stones. We once
remember part of a brood of young ducks,
half grown, taking in such a quantity of gravel,
as not only filled the gizzard but the craw,
and even the gullet; they soon after died.
Many species of birds possess a reservoir for
food, called a craw, or crop, which seems to
answer the same purpose as the first stomach
in ruminating animals, and here it is that the
food is softened and prepared for the stomach,
or carried to the young.</p>

    <div>DISEASES OF THE STOMACH.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c006'><i>Flatulent colic, gripes, &amp;c.</i>—This is a disorder
of considerable importance, and often
terminates in inflammation of the bowels, entirely
from the circumstance of not being sufficiently
understood. The symptoms are well
known. The horse is very uneasy, paws his
litter, looks round to his flanks, sometimes
endeavours to kick his belly, gathers up his
hind legs, and falls down rather suddenly,
rolls upon his back, suddenly gets up again,
and appears in extreme pain. The pulse is in
its natural state, and the inner surface of the
eyelids is not unusually red. The disorder
comes on suddenly, the animal being previously
in good health. The horse is sometimes
costive, but not often, and in some cases
the dung is rather loose. Bleeding can scarcely
be considered an essential remedy in this
complaint, because it is often cured without it.
But it is a safe practice, as the distension of
the bowels by the confined air may otherwise
produce inflammation before relief is afforded.
It should never therefore be omitted. The
next thing to be done is to give some carminative
medicine; and about a pint of brandy
or gin and water is as good a carminative as
can be given: on all common occasions it
may be considered the best, because it is the
most innocent as well as effectual. There
are cases, however, where the stomach has
been so injured by ill treatment, that a more
powerful medicine is required. The following
tincture should then be given in the dose
I shall soon name. Brandy and water, however,
that is, from four to six ounces of brandy
to twelve ounces of water, should always be
preferred, because it is sufficiently strong, in
almost all cases, to answer the purpose. For
it should be known that the strong medicines
usually employed in this disorder, especially
oil of turpentine and peppermint, pepper,
large doses of ginger and grains of paradise
and opium, though they generally afford relief,
are sure to increase the disposition to the
disorder by weakening the stomach. The
weakest stimulant, therefore, that will afford
relief with certainty should be preferred, and
its repetition avoided for the future, by avoiding
the causes which produced the disorder,
and these will soon be pointed out.</p>

<p class='c006'>It sometimes happens, and not unfrequently,
that there is an accumulation of excrement in
the cœcum, by which the valvular orifice is so
completely obstructed, that it cannot be overcome
by any efforts of the stomach, though
excited by opium and the most powerful carminatives.
Clysters in this case will always
afford relief, if properly administered; that
is, by means of a large ox’s bladder and a long
pewter pipe, not less than fourteen or fifteen
inches in length. The only clyster required
is from half a pound to a pound of salt, and
five or six quarts of warm water. This will
excite the whole of the large bowels to action,
and dislodge the fæces from the cœcum. By
this means the animals may always be relieved,
and without it he will in such cases
certainly die.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are cases of flatulent colic, however,
which are in their nature incurable, that is,
first, when there is such a quantity of food
taken into the stomach, and the digestive
power of the organ has been so depressed by
previous disorder, that no effort it can make,
however powerfully it may be excited, can
enable it to get rid of its contents. Secondly,
when the horse is put to work, and into quick
exercise in that state: such cases are by no
means uncommon in post and coach horses,
and rupture of the stomach is sometimes the
consequence. When this happens, the horse
breaks out into a profuse, but very cold perspiration,
is extremely depressed, breathes
quickly; the pulse can scarcely be felt, but is
very quick. It is soon followed by death.
The distension of the small intestines sometimes
forces a portion of them through the mesentery,
in such a manner that one coil of it
becomes so completely tied that the included
air cannot escape.</p>

cold pump water, or hard water, in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stomach staggers, or sleepy staggers—Paralysis
of the stomach.</i>—The symptoms
of this disorder are great heaviness and drowsiness,
resting the nose in the manger, or inclining
the head, and resting the cheek, or
bearing against the wall. The head is forced
against the manger, or rack, or the nose between
the rack staves. In this way the eyes
and face are often much bruised and swollen.
The horse stands with his fore leg much under
him, appearing to give way every now and
then, as if he would fall. There is an appearance
of convulsive twitching of the muscles
of the neck and chest. There is, too, a great
degree of yellowness, approaching to orange-colour,
of the membranes of the eyes, and
often a yellowness of the mouth also. Urine
scarcely any, and high-coloured; sometimes
none is voided, and sometimes it is discharged
by a convulsive effort. Sometimes the disorder
is attended with locked jaw, ending in
paralysis and death. In the early stage of
the disorder the horse is sometimes suddenly
roused by opening the stable door, he lifts up
his head, and sometimes neighs; but this is
only a momentary effort. When the disease
happens at grass, the animal is generally found
forcing his head against the hedge, or a gate,
or moving about in a state of stupor and apparent
insensibility. Sometimes he is found
struggling in a ditch, and in that situation he
often dies.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as stomach staggers are observed,
the horse should be bled, in order to relieve
the head in some degree; but the principal
object is to enable the stomach to get rid of
the load which oppresses it. Various remedies
have been proposed for this purpose.
The best I believe are purgatives joined with
cordials and stimulants, and small quantities
of warm water frequently, in order to soften
the contents of the stomach. Clysters of
salt and water are useful also, and should be
thrown up several times a day. The disease
is often incurable, probably from a want of
early attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>When medicine cannot be readily procured,
two or three tablespoonfuls of flower of mustard,
and three or four ounces of common salt
may be tried.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Strangles</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease incident to young horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of strangles is very simple.
As the essence of the disease consists in the
formation and suppuration of the tumour
under the jaw, the principal, or almost the
sole attention of the practitioner should be
directed to the hastening of these processes;
therefore, as soon as the tumour of strangles
evidently appears, the part should be actively
blistered. Old practitioners used to recommend
poultices, which, from the thickness of
the horse’s skin, must have very little effect,
even if they could be confined on the part;
and from the difficulty and almost impossibility
of this, and their getting cold and hard,
they must weaken the energies of nature, and
delay the ripening of the tumour. Fomentations
are little more effectual. A blister will
not only secure the completion of the process,
but hasten it by many days, and save the
patient much pain and exhaustion; and it will
produce another good effect—it will, previous
to the opening of the tumour, abate the internal
inflammation and soreness of the throat,
and thus lessen the cough and wheezing.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there is much fever, and evident affection
of the chest, and which should carefully
be distinguished from the oppression and
choaking occasioned by the pressure of the
tumour, it will be proper to bleed.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few cooling medicines, as nitre, emetic
tartar, and perhaps digitalis, may be given, as
the case requires. The appetite, or rather
the ability to eat, will return with the opening
of the abscess. Bran-mashes, or fresh cut
grass or tares, should be liberally supplied;
which will not only afford sufficient nourishment
to recruit the strength of the animal,
but keep the bowels gently open. If the
weakness be not great, no further medicine
will be wanted, except a dose of mild physic,
to prevent the swellings or eruptions which
sometimes succeed to strangles. In cases of
debility, a small quantity of tonic medicine,
as camomile, and gentian with ginger, in
doses of a couple of drachms, may be administered.—<i>The

<p class='c006'>Under the term <i>Structure of the Eye</i>,
Mr. White, describing its anatomy and physiology,
divides the subject into two parts, that
is, the eye itself and its appendages. Under the
latter head, he comprehends the eyelids, the
muscles which move it, the eyelashes, the lachrymal
gland, the puncta lachrymalia, and
lachrymal duct, the caruncle of the eye, the
haw, and the membrane named conjunctiva,
and the muscles by which the eye is moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>He then proceeds:—Having described the
appendages, as they are termed, I shall proceed
to a description of the eye itself, the
structure and economy of which is most curious
and interesting. It is said to be composed
of coats and humours, and this perhaps
is the best manner of considering it. The
first coat that appears is the cornea, or glass
of the eye, which forms the anterior part, and
is beautifully transparent. It is not of a circular
form, as in man, but of an irregular
oval, or rather oblong form, when examined
out of the socket; but in its natural situation
in the living horse, that part which projects
beyond the eyelids is of a regular oval, or rather
of an oblong form, and corresponding in some
degree with the form of the pupil. It forms
a larger portion of the globe of the eye than
in man, and, by its convexity, causes the rays
of light which pass through it to converge
towards the pupil. This convexity may be
too great or too little, and in either case
render vision somewhat imperfect, and cause
starting. The convexity of the cornea is preserved
by the fluid which it incloses, named
aqueous humour. On puncturing the cornea
this fluid escapes, and then the cornea becomes
flat and wrinkled. On removing the cornea
the iris appears, which is a thin delicate
brown or blackish muscle, with an oblong
hole in the centre, named pupil. The iris is
composed of two orders of fibres; the one circular,
which, by contracting, diminishes, and
even closes the aperture in the centre, named
pupil; the other radiated, which by contracting,
opens or enlarges the aperture or pupil.
The second humour of the eye is situated immediately
behind the pupil, and is named crystalline
humour, or crystalline lens. On
taking it out it appears to be a solid and beautifully
transparent double convex lens, the
posterior surface of which is more convex
than the anterior one. It is found to become
denser and denser from the circumference to
the centre, and the slightest pressure so deranges
it as to lessen or destroy its transparency.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crystalline humour may be considered
as composed of numerous concavo-convex
lenses, admirably fitted to each other; those
of the largest size having their circumference
or edge opposed to and nicely joined to each
other, thus forming altogether a double convex
lens. The point of union between the
two largest lenses is embraced by a band of
muscular fibres, disposed in a circular direction,
and named the ciliary ligament. These,
by contracting, assisted probably by the muscles
of the eye, increase the convexity of the
crystalline lens, or rather of the series of
concavo-convex lenses, of which the eye is
composed, in a manner so just and equal, as
to adapt it to the distance of the object at
which the animal is looking, while, by the
relaxation of these muscular fibres, the convexity
of the lens is diminished by its own
elasticity. These changes take place with
inconceivable rapidity and accuracy. There
are other muscular fibres proceeding from
the band of circular fibres named ciliary processes,
in a straight, or rather radiated, direction,
towards the second coat of the eye,
named tunica choroides; these are so arranged
as to be drawn into folds, by which disposition
they are enabled to perform their office
more easily, which is that of drawing the lens
towards the optic nerve, and thereby increasing
the intensity of vision, whereby the animal
is enabled to see small objects distinctly.
The crystalline lens is inclosed in a transparent
capsule, which is not in contact with it,
there being about one drop, as it is computed,
of a transparent liquid interposed, which,
from the anatomist’s name who first observed
it, has been called ‘liquor Morgagnii.’</p>

<p class='c006'>I have seen a case where the convexity of
the lens has been so increased, by an unusual
degree of contraction of the circular fibres,
named ciliary ligament, that it burst the capsule,
and was forced out of its situation. I
found it lying with its posterior convex surface
on the inferior margin of the iris; about
half of it appearing in the anterior chamber
of the eye, as it is termed. The transparency
of the lens was not affected, at least, it appeared
so to me, and I rather think the accident
had occurred, just at the time I observed
it, from twitching the horse violently. In
cataract, a disorder in which the crystalline
lens becomes opaque, it always becomes globular
in its form from an irritable state of the
band of circular fibres; the same effect may
be observed in the circular fibres of the iris,
causing the pupil to be small, even in a moderate
light, while the inflammation is going on,
which occasions the cataract; but when the
opacity is such as to exclude the light from
the posterior part of the eye, which contains
the third or vitreous humour, with the choroid
coat, retina, and optic nerve, then the circular
fibres relax, and the radiated fibres draw
up the iris somewhat irregularly, which adhering
to the capsule of the opaque lens, the
pupil remains permanently open.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that part of the eye which is posterior
to the iris, is chiefly occupied by the third, or
vitreous humour, and it is in this humour
that the crystalline lens is imbedded. The
vitreous humour is perfectly transparent, and
consists of a fluid, inclosed in numerous small
transparent cells, all of which appear to be
inclosed in one delicate transparent membrane,
named tunica arachnoidea. If the vitreous
humour is cut, by snipping it with scissors, a
fluid, like water, drops from it freely, so that
it appears to be nothing more than water,
probably holding a little salt in solution, which
escapes when the transparent cells are thus
cut open.</p>

<p class='c006'>That part of the vitreous humour in which
the lens is imbedded is different from the
other parts, and of the consistence of jelly.
Immediately behind the ciliary ligament, as
it is termed, the arachnoid coat may be inflated
with a small blowpipe, and made to
resemble a circular canal; this has been called
from the name of the person who first observed
it, the circular canal of Petit. It is
supposed to be connected with the radiated
fibres of the iris. I have seen the whole of
this humour in the eye of a sheep that had
an hydatid in the right ventricle of the brain,
of the consistence of jelly.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is now time to speak of the optic nerve,
and its appendage, the retina, with the third
coat of the eye, named tunica choroides. The
retina is a delicate transparent membrane,
which embraces the vitreous humour, and is
supposed to be an expansion or production of
the optic nerve, serving to receive the impressions
of objects, in order that they may
be conveyed by the optic nerve to the organ
of vision, named thalamus nervi optici, or
speaking of both organs, thalami nervorum
opticorum. After death, the retina becomes
opaque, and of a light grey colour. It is so
delicate a membrane, that there is some difficulty
in preserving it for exhibition unless
the eye is quite fresh. Under the retina
lies the choroid coat, which is nothing more
than a plexus of blood vessels, covered with
a mucus substance of different colours. In
the human eye it is black, which is the cause
of the human pupil, or apple of the eye, appearing
black; but in the horse it is variegated
with mucus of a purple, a blue, a green, and
a black colour, which, blending together,
causes the pupil to appear of a dark blue
colour. This mixture of colours in the bottom
of the eye, or choroid coat, has been
named tappetum lucidum.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last and most considerable coat of the
eye is the sclerotic coat, which is a very
strong thick membrane, including all the
other coats and humours, except the cornea.
The sclerotic coat forms the greater portion
of the globe of the eye, and is intimately
united towards the anterior part with the cornea,
which may be viewed as bearing the
same relation to the sclerotic coat, as the
glass of a watch does to the case. By maceration
in water the cornea separates from the
sclerotic coat completely.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Diseases of the eye.</i>—Though the horse’s
eye is commonly supposed to be subject to
a variety of diseases, they may, without impropriety,
be comprehended under two heads.
That is, disorders which arise from internal
causes, and such as are occasioned by blows,
bites, and other accidents. The former are
generally, I may say almost always, incurable;
that is, they are incapable of a perfect
cure, or, in other words, the eye is very rarely
perfectly restored after being so affected, unless
a complete cataract, or total blindness,
takes place in one eye.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Summering Hunters.</i>—Lest it should be
supposed that I am averse to turning hunters
out at all in the summer months, it will be
better, perhaps, not to proceed farther without
explaining myself on that head. So far from
being averse to it, I would strongly recommend
it, under favourable circumstances. In
case of having recourse to blistering, it is
most serviceable; and after firing, almost necessary;
but then they should be turned out
only at night, and into a place where there is
but little grass, and have two, if not three
feeds of corn a day, but nothing else to eat
till they go out, unless it be a few vetches,
for four or five days at a time, when they are
young and tender, in the months of May or
June; but this should not be repeated more
than three or four times, as they tend to make
horses very foul, and when in pod are most
injurious to them. It is not every one who
keeps hunters that has paddocks to turn them
into; nor, indeed, do they fall to the lot of
many; but when they are to be had the advantage
is great, as a horse is safe in them,
and the smaller they are, within reason, the
better; for it is not the grass that we want,
but the exercise and the moisture of the
ground for their feet, and the bracing effects of
the pure air. If only one or two hunters are
turned into a large paddock, and the grass
grows upon them, some sheep should be put
in with them to keep it down. Their bite
also sweetens the herbage, and makes it more
nutritious; but paddocks should never be
mown. Paddocks, however, are always to be
made, and at a trifling expense. A small
piece of ground—say thirty square yards—is
sufficient. Let it be hurdled round, and
then lined with fagots reared up from seven
to eight feet high. A stallion may be kept in
these places with the greatest safety as to his
breaking out of them, for he will never attempt
it so long as he cannot see through or
over the fence. The fagots, so far from being
worse, are better for the use they are put to;
and they are within the reach of every one
who resides in the country, at five shillings a
score, if he do not grow them himself. The
hurdle that lets the horse in and out should
often be changed, and then he will be still less
inclined to attempt to break out.</p>

<p class='c006'>However beneficial this turning out a horse
in the summer may be, it is comparatively
trifling with the advantages that are reaped by
a winter’s run. I have seen horses, as it were,
renovated in their constitution, by being turned
out for a winter; and, as far as relates to their
legs and feet, it is, I think, the only time
when anything effectual can be done for them,
when the injury has been considerable.—</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is said that the Earl of Plymouth first
tried the plan of summering his hunters altogether
within the stable, with little variation
in their treatment; by which it is asserted
their condition was fully preserved, and that,
by this means, his horses entered on their
hunting season in full wind, speed, and bottom.
Others, to avoid this extreme, have
soiled their hunters in the stable, or have
given carrots; and some have gone a step further,
and have pursued the in-door summering,
not in stables, but in loose boxes. Still, in
all these cases, regular exercise is required, or
the feet must suffer, or the horses are apt
to become pursy, thick-winded, roarers, or
broken-winded. This exercise is apt to be
severe, and then the wear on the limbs continues
the deterioration which the hunting
season had brought on. But if a sportsman
had one, two, or three hunters only, and would
use them gently every day as hacks, he might
then summer them in this way without injury
to the horses, provided they had not suffered
much from strains or foot lamenesses; in
which case absolute rest would of course be
requisite. It would therefore seem from all
this, that a medium plan, which should combine
the renovating effects of air, mild exercise,
moisture to the feet, and the relaxent
effects of grass, might be followed with much
more propriety and hope of general advantage
than either total turning out on grass, or total
confining within on hay.</p>

<p class='c006'>The box summering of hunters, in my
opinion, is of this kind, and consists in allowing
each hunter his liberty in a loose box,
having fly wire casements and closed doors
during the day, in which he is to be moderately
fed with corn and hay. At night, unless
it be stormy or very cold, he is to be turned
out into a small sheltered paddock, which
affords only a short bite of upland grass, of
which an acre is sufficient for each horse; but
not more than three should be together, to
avoid violent racing about amongst them, and
other accidents. When the field is eaten
quite bare, a similar plot may be substituted;
but, in all cases, an open shed within each
field, independent of the boxes, should afford
a refuge against accidental storms and rain.
At an early hour every morning the hunter
should be taken to his box, from whence he
is not again to come out till the evening, unless
a very favourable gloomy day offers itself.
Carrots may be substituted for part of the
corn and hay with advantage in stable summering;
which variation, and many others,
will present themselves, and prove beneficial,
when the true principles on which the subject
should be considered form the basis of the
determination. The treatment of the feet
during this period must be regulated by circumstances;
one or two quiet horses, used to
each other, may be allowed to range together
without removing the hinder shoes; but it is
always a safer plan to take them off, unless
the ground be very hard, or the box be paved.
This latter circumstance can always be obviated,
by allowing these boxes to be covered
over either with tan, sod, or other soft matter;
but boxes expressly built for this particular
purpose would be better altogether unpaved;
in which case, to avoid dust, and to keep the
flooring cool, it might be moderately watered
every morning. The fore feet may be tipped,
particularly if at all inclined to contraction;
or should they become hard, hot, and dry,
such means must be made use of as the medical
parts of the work direct, under diseases
of the feet. The general state of the horse
ought also be attended to, as his bowels, that
they do not become costive; and the skin,
that it do not become hide-bound or eruptive,
or that a short dry cough may not steal a
march unobserved on him. The careful and
intelligent groom must watch over the health
of his in-door summered horses with vigilance,
and alter his plan according to circumstances;
but the still more prudent owner
would do well to have them inspected weekly
by a well-informed veterinary surgeon.—<i>Nimrod</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Large pimples or lumps often suddenly
appear on the skin of the horse, and especially
in the spring; and occasionally they disappear
as quickly as they come. Sometimes they
seem to be attended with great itching, but
in others they appear not in the least to annoy
the animal. When they have remained a
few days, the cuticle frequently peels off, and
a small scaly spot, though rarely a sore, is
left. This is called a surfeit, from its resemblance
to some eruptions on the skin of the
human being, when indigestible or unwholesome
food has been taken. These lumps are,
in some cases, confined to the neck; but
they oftener spread over the sides, back, loins,
and quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bleeding will always be beneficial—from
three to five quarts may be taken, according
to the strength of the horse, the extent of the
eruption, and the degree of fever. Physic
never does good. Alteratives will be found
useful—and particularly the alterative which
was recommended for hide-bound, and in the
same doses. These should be given on several
successive nights. The night is better
than the morning, because the warmth of the
stable will cause the antimony and sulphur
to act more powerfully on the skin. The
horse should be warmly clothed—half an
hour’s walking exercise should be given, an
additional rug having been thrown over him—such
green meat as can be procured should
be used in moderate quantities, and the chill
should be taken from the water.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A cuticular eruption, called surfeit, is a
fourth appearance that mange frequently assumes.
It seems, in many cases, the consequence
of some active inflammatory state of
the constitution, frequently of some great
local internal inflammation; in which cases it
puts on something of an acute form. It sometimes
breaks out suddenly in bitches after pupping;
and in dogs newly recovered from distemper;
in fact, any great vascular excitement
may produce it; thus, when a dog travels during
a great part of a very hot day, and becomes
afterwards exposed to cold, a surfeit is oftentimes
the consequence. It is usually seen in
the form of partial blotches, it being seldom
that it extends universally over the body. In
some cases there is little appearance of elevated
scab; but large patches show themselves,
from which the hair has fallen, and
left the skin bare and rough from the branny
scaly eruption, which itches with more or less
violence. Some sportsmen allege that a surfeit
is sometimes occasioned by giving food in
a hot state. Salt provisions have certainly
brought it on; and long-continued feeding on
oat or barley meal has done the same.—<i>The Horse</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Swallows are found in every country of the

year in the same climate; the times of their
appearance and departure in this country are
well known: they are the constant harbingers
of Spring, and on their arrival all nature assumes
a more cheerful aspect. The bill of
this genus is short, very broad at the base, and
a little bent: the head is flat, and the neck
scarcely visible; the tongue is short, broad,
and cloven; tail mostly forked; wings, legs
short.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all the various families of birds, which
resort to this island for food and shelter, there
is none which has occasioned so many conjectures
respecting its appearance and departure
as the swallow tribe. The habits and modes
of living of this tribe are perhaps more conspicuous
than those of any other. From the
time of their arrival to that of their departure
they seem continually before our eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The swallow lives habitually in the air, and
performs its various functions in that element;
and whether it pursues its fluttering prey, and
follows the devious windings of the insects on
which it feeds, or endeavours to escape the
birds of prey by the quickness of its motion,
it describes lines so mutable, so varied, so interwoven,
and so confused, that they hardly
can be pictured by words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not many attempts have been made to preserve
swallows alive during the winter, and of
these few have succeeded. The following experiments,
by Mr. James Pearson of London,
we shall give nearly in his own words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Five or six of these birds were taken about
the latter end of August, 1784, in a bat fowling-net,
at night; they were put separately
into small cages, and fed with nightingales’
food; in about a week or ten days they took
food of themselves; they were then put altogether
into a deep cage, four feet long, with
gravel at the bottom; a broad shallow pan
with water was placed in it, in which they
sometimes washed themselves, and seemed
much strengthened by it. One day Mr. Pearson
observed that they went into the water
with unusual eagerness, hurrying in and out
again repeatedly, with such swiftness as if they
had been suddenly seized with a frenzy. Being
anxious to see the result, he left them to
themselves about half an hour, and on going
to the cage again, found them all huddled together
in a corner, apparently dead; the cage
was then placed at a proper distance from the
fire, when only two of them recovered, and
were as healthy as before; the rest died. The
two remaining ones were allowed to wash
themselves occasionally for a short time only;
but their feet soon after became swelled and
inflamed, which Mr. P. attributed to their
perching, and they died about Christmas; thus
the first year’s experiment was in some measure
lost. Not discouraged by the failure of
this, Mr. P. determined to make a second
trial the succeeding year, from a strong desire
of being convinced of the truth respecting
their going into a state of torpidity. Accordingly,
the next season, having taken some more
birds, he put them into the cage, and in every
respect pursued the same methods as with the
last; but to guard their feet from the bad
effects of damp and cold, he covered the
perches with flannel, and had the pleasure to
observe that the birds throve extremely well;
they sung their song through the winter, and
soon after Christmas began to moult, which
they got through without any difficulty, and
lived three or four years, regularly moulting
every year at the usual time. On the renewal
of their feathers, it appeared that their tails
were forked exactly the same as in those birds
which return hither in the spring, and in every
respect their appearance was the same. These
birds, says Mr. Pearson, were exhibited to the
Society for promoting Natural History, on the
14th day of February, 1786, at the time they
were in a deep moult, during a severe frost,
when the snow was on the ground. Minutes
of this circumstance was entered in the books
of the society. These birds died at last from
neglect, during a long illness which Mr. Pearson
had; they died in the summer. Mr.
Pearson concludes his very interesting account
in these words:—January 20, 1797. I have
now in my house, No. 21, Great Newport-street,
Long Acre, four swallows in moult, in
as perfect health as any birds ever appeared
to be when moulting.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_527.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Mute Swan.</i> (<i>Anas Cygnus Mansuetus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Cygne</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—The plumage of
this species is of the same snowy whiteness as
that of the wild swan, and the bird is covered
next the body with the same kind of fine close
down; but it greatly exceeds the wild swan in
size, weighing about twenty-five pounds, and
measuring more in the length of the body and
extent of the wings. This also differs in being
furnished with a projecting callous black tubercle,
or knob, on the base of the upper mandible,
and in the colour of the bill, which in
this is red, with black edges and tips: the
naked skin between the bill and the eyes is also
of the latter colour: in the wild swan this bare
space is yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manners and habits are much the same
in both kinds, particularly when they are in a
wild state; for indeed this species cannot properly
be called domesticated; they are only as
it were partly reclaimed from a state of nature,
and invited by the friendly and protecting hand
of man to decorate and embellish the artificial
lakes and pools which beautify his pleasure
grounds. On these the swan cannot be accounted
a captive, for he enjoys all the sweets
of liberty. Placed there, as they are the largest
of all the British birds, so are they to the eye
the most pleasing and elegant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The swan, although possessed of the power
to rule, yet molests none of the other water
birds, and is singularly social and attentive to
those of his own family, which he protects
from every insult. While they are employed
with the cares of the young brood, it is not
safe to approach near them, for they will fly
upon any stranger, whom they often beat to
the ground by repeated blows, and they have
been known by a stroke of the wing to break
a man’s leg. But, however powerful they are
with their wings, yet a slight blow on the
head will kill them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The swan for ages past has been protected
on the Thames as royal property, and it continues
at this day to be accounted felony to
steal their eggs. By this means their increase
is secured, and they prove a delightful ornament
to that noble river. Latham says, in
the reign of Edward IV. the estimation they
were held in was such, that no one who possessed
a freehold of less than the clear yearly
value of five marks, was permitted even to keep
any. In those times hardly a piece of water
was left unoccupied by these birds, as well on
account of the gratification they gave to the
eye of their lordly owners, as that which they
also afforded when they graced the sumptuous
board at the splendid feasts of that period;
but the fashion of those days is passed away,
and swans are not nearly so common now as
they were formerly, being by most people accounted
a coarse kind of food, and consequently
held in little estimation; but the cygnets (so
the young swans are called) are still fattened
for the table, and are sold very high, commonly
for a guinea each, and sometimes for
more: hence it may be presumed they are
better food than is generally imagined.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes her nest, concealed
among the rough herbage, near the water’s
edge; she lays from six to eight large white
eggs, and sits on them about six weeks (some
say eight weeks) before they are hatched. The
young do not acquire their full plumage till
the second year.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is found by experience that the swan
will not thrive if kept out of the water; confined
in a court-yard he makes an awkward
figure, and soon becomes dirty, tawdry, dull,
and spiritless.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the setting in of frosty weather the wild
swans are said to associate in prodigious multitudes,
and thus united, to use every effort to
prevent the water from freezing: this they accomplish
by the continual stir kept up amongst
them; and by constantly dashing it with their
extended wings, they are enabled to remain as
long as it suits their convenience, in some favourite
part of a lake or river which abounds
with their food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The swan is very properly entitled the
peaceful monarch of the lake: conscious of his
superior strength, he fears no enemy, nor suffers
any bird, however powerful, to molest him;
neither does he prey upon any one. His vigorous
wing is as a shield against the attacks
even of the eagle, and the blows of it are said
to be so powerful as to stun or kill the fiercest
of his foes. The wolf or the fox may surprise
him in the dark, but their efforts are vain in
the day. His food consists of the grasses and
weeds, and the seeds and roots of plants which
grow on the margin of the water, and of the
myriads of insects which skim over, or float on
its surface; also occasionally of the slimy inhabitants
within its bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes her nest of the withered
leaves and stalks of reeds and rushes, and lays
commonly six or seven thick-shelled white
eggs: she is said to sit upon them six weeks
before they are hatched. Both male and female
are very attentive to their young, and
will suffer no enemy to approach them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_528.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Wild Swan.</i> (<i>Anas Cygnus ferus</i>,
<span class='sc'>Linn.</span>; <i>Le Cygne Sauvage</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—Measures
five feet in length, and above seven in
breadth, and weighs from thirteen to sixteen
pounds. The bill is three inches long, of a
yellowish white from the case to the middle,
and thence to the tip, black; the bare space
from the bill over the eye and eyelids is yellow;
the whole plumage in adult birds is of a
pure white, and, next to the skin, they are
clothed with a thick fine down; the legs are
black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species generally keep together in
small flocks, or families, except in the pairing
season, and in the setting in of winter.
At the latter period they assemble in immense
multitudes, particularly on the large
rivers and lakes of the thinly inhabited northern
parts of Europe, Asia, and America:
but when the extremity of the weather threatens
to become insupportable, in order to shun
the gathering storm, they shape their course
high in air, in divided and diminished numbers,
in search of milder climates. In such
seasons they are not uncommonly seen in various
parts of the British isles, and in other
more southern countries of Europe. The
same is observed of them in the North American
states. They do not, however, remain
longer than till the approaching of the spring,
when they again retire northward to the
arctic regions to breed. A few, indeed, drop
short, and perform that office by the way, for
they are known to breed in some of the Hebrides,
the Orkney, Shetland, and other solitary
isles; but these are hardly worth notice:
the great bodies of them are met with in the
large rivers and lakes near Hudson’s Bay,
and those of Kamtschatka, Lapland, and Iceland.
They are said to return to the latter
place in flocks of about a hundred at a time in
the spring, and also to pour in upon that
island from the north, in nearly the same
manner, on their way southward in the autumn.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Swan-Goose.</i> (<i>Anas Cygnoides</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>;
<i>L’Oie de Guinée</i>, <span class='sc'>Buff.</span>)—This species is
more than a yard in length, and is of a size
between the swan and the common-goose; it
is distinguished from others of the goose tribe
by its upright and stately deportment, by
having a large knob on the root of the upper
mandible, and a skin, almost bare of feathers,
hanging down like a pouch, or a wattle, under
the throat; a white line or fillet is extended
from the corners of the mouth over the front
of the brow; the base of the bill is orange;
irides reddish-brown; a dark-brown or black
stripe runs down the hinder part of the neck,
from the head to the back; the fore part of
the neck, and the breast, are yellowish-brown;
the back, and all the upper parts, brownish-grey,
edged with a lighter colour; the sides,
and the feathers which cover the thighs, are
clouded with nearly the same colours as the
back, and edged with white; belly white;
legs orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that these birds originally were
found in Guinea only; the breed has, however,
now become pretty common, and they
are widely dispersed, in a wild as well as a
domesticated state, over various parts of the
world, both in warm and in cold climates.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are found wild about the lake Baikal,
in the east of Siberia, and in Kamtschatka;
and they are kept tame in most parts of the
Russian empire.</p>

<p class='c006'>These geese, like others of the tame kind,
vary much both in colour of the bill, legs,
and plumage, as well as in size; but they all
retain the knob on the base of the upper
mandible, and the pouch or wattle under the
gullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are kept by the curious in various
parts of England, and are more noisy than
the common goose; nothing can stir either in
the night or in the day, without their sounding
the alarm, by their hoarse cacklings,
and loud shrill cries. They breed with the
common goose, and their offspring are as prolific
as those of any other kind. The female
is of a smaller size than the male; the head,
neck, and breast are fulvous; paler on the
upper part; the back, wings, and tail, dull
brown, with pale edges; belly white; in other
respects they are like the male, but the knob
over the bill is smaller.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This species is nearly an ounce in weight:
length near eight inches: breadth about eighteen;
the bill is black; irides dusky; the whole
plumage is black, except the chin, which is
whitish; the wings are extremely long in proportion,
and the legs so short that it rises from
the ground with difficulty; the tail is forked;
legs and toes black. It has four toes, all placed
forward. In this particular it deviates from
one of the characters of the swallow genus.</p>

<p class='c006'>In very warm weather these birds soar to a
great height, but in cold or moist weather fly
low in search of flies and other winged insects,
which at that time cannot ascend.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Swiftness</span>, <i>s.</i> Speed, rapidity, velocity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Swim</span>, <i>v.</i> To float on the water, not to sink; to move progressively in the
water by the motion of the limbs; to be conveyed by the stream; to
glide along with a smooth or dizzy motion; to be dizzy.</p>

<p class='c006'>An accidental fall into water may be most
dangerous to those ignorant of the art of
swimming, by observing the directions here
given, a person may save himself from drowning.
If he falls into deep water, he will rise
to the surface by floating, and will continue
there if he does not elevate his hands, and
the keeping them down is essential to his
safety. If he moves his hands under the
water, in any way he pleases, his head will
rise so high as to allow him free liberty to
breathe. And if, in addition, he moves his
legs exactly as in the action of walking up
stairs, his shoulders will rise above the water,
so that he may use less exertion with his
hands, or apply them to other purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Swimming of Birds.</i>—The superior velocity
with which aquatic birds swim under water
has not wholly escaped notice; but it is not
entirely produced by the action of the wings,
which are sometimes used as fins to accelerate
the motion, but is occasioned by the pressure
of the water above. In swimming on the surface
a bird has two motions; one upward, the
other forward, at every stroke of the feet; so
that when covered with water, that force which
was lost by the upward motion is all directed
to the progressive, by which it is enabled to
pursue its prey, or to escape an enemy with
incredible speed. The otter and water rat swim
much faster under water than they do upon the
surface.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

but with the point of the upper mandible
slightly bent and notched; lower mandible
straight; base more high than broad; nostrils
at the sides of the base oval, and partly covered
with a membrane: legs having the shank longer
than the middle toe; toes three before and one
behind, the outer toe being joined at its base
to the middle one; wings with the first quill
very short, sometimes indeed wanting; the second
and third nearly of equal length; wing

<p class='c006'>Animals which are unable to associate with
their own species will sometimes form most
strange attachments. I had last year a solitary
pigeon, who, being unable to procure a
mate, attached itself to an old barn-door fowl,
whose side it seldom left at night, roosting by
him in the hen-house. The cock seemed sensible
of the attachment of the pigeon, and never
molested it, or drove it from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Aston Hall, in Warwickshire, I remember
to have seen a cat and a large fierce bloodhound,
who were always together, the cat
following the dog about the yard, and never
seeming tired of his society. They fed together,
and slept in the same kennel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some animals of the same species form also
strong attachments for each other. This was
shown in the case of two Hanoverian horses,
who had long served together during the
peninsular war, in the German brigade of
artillery. They had assisted in drawing the
same gun, and had been inseparable companions
in many battles. One of them was at
last killed; and after the engagement the survivor
was picqueted as usual, and his food
brought to him. He refused, however, to
eat, and was constantly turning round his
head to look for his companion, sometimes
neighing, as if to call him. All the care that
was bestowed upon him was of no avail. He
was surrounded by other horses, but he did
not notice them; and he shortly afterwards
died, not having once tasted food from the
time his former associate was killed. A gentleman
who witnessed the circumstance assured
me that nothing could be more affecting
than the whole demeanour of this poor
horse.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>When a dog is cropped, it is usual also to
cut off a portion of the tail. Dog fanciers,
as they are termed, commonly bite it off; but
it were to be wished that a larger portion was
added to both their knowledge and humanity.
The tail does not grow materially after cutting,
therefore the length may be previously
determined on with sufficient accuracy, and
cut off with a pair of sharp scissors. If the
ears and tail are cut off at the same time, it
is prudent to tie a ligature about the tail, to
prevent the effusion of blood, as sometimes
the bleeding, from both ears and tail together,
will weaken the animal too much, and early
distemper may follow; but when the tail
alone is cut, no ligature is necessary. When
a ligature is used, neither tie it too tight, nor
suffer it to remain more than twelve hours.
On the twisting off either the ears or tail, I
will waste no invective; for if the cruelty
does not strike the performer, I am sure no
assertion of mine, that it is far inferior in
every point of view to excision, and has for
ever deafened many it has been practised on,

in the form of a decoction as a vehicle for

there is no foundation for this opinion. It is

<p class='c006'>The rotten parts of the frog having been
carefully removed with a knife, and the rest
well cleansed, the tar is to be melted and
poured into the cleft or cavity; a pledget of
tow is then to be laid on the part, and confined
by some proper contrivance. In bad cases a
small proportion of sulphuric acid should be
carefully mixed with the tar; and when a
thrush has degenerated into the disease termed
canker, a larger proportion of the acid should
be employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tar mixed with oil of turpentine and cantharides

employ tar as a remedy for cough; but
it more frequently aggravates than relieves the

<p>THE TEAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This beautiful little duck seldom exceeds
eleven ounces in weight, or measures more,
stretched out, than fourteen inches and a half
in length, and twenty-three and a half in
breadth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bill is a dark lead colour, tipped with
black; irides pale hazel; a glossy bottle green
patch, edged on the upper side with pale brown,
and beneath with cream-coloured white, covers
each eye, and extends to the nape of the
neck: the rest of the head, and the upper part
of the neck, are of a deep reddish chestnut,
darkest on the forehead, and freckled on the
chin and about the eyes with cream-coloured
spots: the hinder part of the neck, the shoulders,
part of the scapulars, sides under the
wings, and lower belly, towards the vent, are
elegantly pencilled with black, ash-brown, and
white transverse waved lines; the breast, greatly
resembling the beautifully spotted appearance
of an India shell, is of a pale brown or reddish
yellow, and each feather is tipped with a roundish
heart-shaped black-spot: the belly is a
cream-coloured white: back and rump brown,
each feather edged with a pale colour: vent
black: the primary quills, lesser and greater
coverts, are brown; the last deeply tipped with
white, which forms a bar across the wings; the
first six of the secondary quills are of a fine
velvet black; those next to them, towards the
scapulars, are of a most resplendent glossy
green, and both are tipped with white, forming
the divided black and green bar or beauty spot
of the wings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tail consists of fourteen feathers, of a
hoary brown colour; with pale edges: the legs
and feet are of a dirty lead colour. The female,
which is less than the male, is prettily
freckled about the head and neck with brown
and white. She has not the green patch behind
the eyes, but a brown streak there, which
extends itself to the nape of the neck; the
crown of the head is dark brown; the upper
mandible yellow on the edges, olive green on
the sides, and olive brown on the ridge; nail
black, and the under bill yellow; breast, belly,
and vent glossy yellowish white, spotted on
the latter parts with brown; the upper plumage
is dark brown, each feather bordered
with rusty brown, and edged with grey: the
wings and legs nearly the same as those of the
male.</p>

<p class='c006'>The teal is common in England in the winter
months, but it is uncertain whether or not
they remain throughout the year to breed, as
is the case in France. The female makes a
large nest, composed of soft dried grasses, (and,
it is said, the pith of rushes) lined with feathers,
cunningly concealed in a hole among
the roots of reeds and bulrushes near the edge
of the water, and some assert that it rests on
the surface of the water, so as to rise and fall
with it. The eggs are of the size of those of
a pigeon, six or seven in number, and of a dull
white colour, marked with small brownish
spots; but it appears that they sometimes lay
ten or twelve eggs, for Buffon remarks that
that number of young ones are seen in clusters
on the pools, feeding on cresses, wild chervil,
&amp;c., and no doubt, as they grow up, they feed,
like other ducks, on the various seeds, grasses,
and water plants, as well as upon the smaller
animated beings with which all stagnant waters
are so abundantly stored. The teal is highly
esteemed for the excellent flavour of its flesh:
it is known to breed, and remain throughout
the year in various temperate climates of the
world, and is met with as far northward as
Iceland in the summer.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Of all the prizes that a wildfowl shooter
could wish to meet with, a flock of teal is the
very first. Independently of their being by
far the best birds of the whole anas tribe,
they are so much easier of access, and require
such a slight blow, that no matter whether
you are prepared for wild fowl, partridges, or
snipes, you may at most times with very little
trouble contrive to get near them; and this
being once done, you have only to shoot
straight to be pretty sure of killing.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have seen teal “duck the flash,” though
never but once, and then I had rather a slow
shooting gun.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you spring a teal, he will not soar up
and leave the country like a wild duck, but
most probably keep along the brook, like a
sharp flying woodcock, and then drop suddenly
down; but you must keep your eye on
the place, as he is very apt to get up again
and fly to another before he will quietly settle.
He will frequently, too, swim down the
stream the moment after he drops, so that if
you do not quickly cast your eye that way,
instead of continuing to look for him in one
spot, he will probably catch sight of you and
fly up, while your attention is directed to the
wrong place. If the brook in which you find
him is obscured by many trees, you had better
direct your follower to make a large circle,
and get a head of, and watch him, in case he
should slily skim away down the brook, and
by this means escape from you altogether.
You should avoid firing at random, as this
may drive him quite away from your beat.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The tench is generally prized as a fine rich
fish in England, but it is not so much esteemed
on the continent: the Germans, in derision,
call it the Shoemaker. They take red worms
best in the spring; and gentles, not too much
scoured, or sweet paste, in the hot months.
Use a fine gut-line, quill-float, and No. 9 or
10 hook; fish close to the bottom, and
ground-bait with small pellets of bread, or
chewed bread, or bread and bran mixed; or
throw in about half-a-dozen gentles, or pieces
of worms, frequently, close to your float.
When the large tench take a bait, especially
in still waters, they take or suck it in slowly,
and generally draw the float straight down;
strike immediately it disappears.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tench will breed in rivers, lakes, and
ponds, but they thrive best in those ponds
where the bottom is composed of loamy clay,
or mud, and in foul and weedy waters; they
will sometimes bite very free all day in summer,
during warm, close, dark weather, particularly
while small, misty rain descends; at
other times, only late in the evening, or early
in the morning.—<i>Salter.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tennis</span>, <i>s.</i> A play at which a ball is driven with a racket.</p>

<p class='c006'>A tennis court is usually ninety-six or
ninety-seven feet long, by thirty-three or four
in breadth. A net hangs across the middle,
over which the ball must be struck, to make
any stroke good. At the entrance of a tennis-court
there is a long covered passage before
the dedans, the place where spectators usually
are, into which, whenever a ball is played, it
counts for a certain stroke. This long passage
is divided into different apartments, which are
called galleries, viz. from the line towards the
dedans, is the first gallery; door, second gallery;
and the last gallery, is what is called the
service-side. From the dedans to the last gallery
are the figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, each at a
yard distance, marking the chaces, one of the
most essential parts of this game. On the
other side of the line is the first gallery; door,
second gallery; and last gallery, what is called
the hazard-side; every ball played into the
last gallery on this side tells for a certain
stroke, the same as into the dedans. Between
the second and this last gallery are the figures
1, 2, marking the chaces on the hazard-side.
Over this long gallery is the pent-house, on
which the ball is played from the service-side
to begin a set of tennis, and if the player should
fail striking the ball (so as to rebound from
the pent-house) over a certain line on the service-side,
it is reckoned a fault; and two such
faults following are counted for a stroke. If
the ball pass round the pent-house, on the opposite
side of the court, and fall beyond a particular
described line, it is called passe, goes
for nothing, and the player is to serve again.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the right hand of the court from the
dedans, a part of the wall projects more than
the rest, in order to make a variety in the
stroke, and render it more difficult to be returned
by the adversary, and is called the
tambour: the grill is the last thing on the
right hand, in which if the ball be struck, it is
reckoned 15, or a certain stroke.</p>

<p class='c006'>A set of tennis consists of six games, but if
what is called an advantage set be played, two
successive games above five games must be
won to decide; or in case it should be six
games all, two games must still be won on one
side to conclude the set.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the player gives his service in order
to begin the set, his adversary is supposed to
return the ball, wherever it falls after the first
rebound, untouched; for example: if at the
figure 1, the chace is called at a yard, that is
to say, at a yard from the dedans; this chace
remains till a second service is given, and if
the player on the service side should let the
ball go after his adversary returns it, and the
ball fall on or between any one of these figures,
they must change sides, for he will be then on
the hazard-side to play for the first chace,
which if he win by striking the ball so as to
fall, after its first rebound, nearer to the dedans
than the figure 1, without his adversary
being able to return it from its first rebound,
he wins a stroke, and then proceeds in like
manner to win a second stroke, &amp;c. If a ball
fall on a line with the first gallery, door, second
gallery, or last gallery, the chace is likewise
called at such or such a place, naming the
gallery, &amp;c. When it is just put over the line,
it is called a chace at the line. If the player
on the service-side return a ball with such
force as to strike the wall on the hazard-side,
so as to rebound, after the first hop, over the
line, it is also called a chace at the line.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chaces on the hazard-side proceed from
the ball being returned either too hard, or not
hard enough: so that the ball, after its first
rebound, falls on this side the line which describes
the hazard-side chaces, in which case it
is a chace at 1, 2, &amp;c. provided there be no
chace depending, and according to the spot
where it exactly falls. When they change
sides, the player, in order to win this chace,
must put the ball over the line, any where, so
that his adversary does not return it. When
there is no chace on the hazard-side, all balls
put over the line from the service-side, without
being returned, reckon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The game, instead of being marked one, two,
three, four, is called for the first stroke, fifteen;
for the second, thirty; for the third, forty; and
for the fourth, game, unless the players get
four strokes each; then, instead of calling it
forty all, it is called deuce, after which, as soon
as any stroke is got, it is called advantage; and
in case the strokes become equal again, deuce
again; till one or the other gets two strokes
following, to win the game.</p>

<p class='c006'>The odds at this game are very uncertain,
on account of the chances: and various methods
of giving odds have been used to render
a match equal.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>At the time when tennis play was taken up
seriously by the nobility, new regulations were
made in the game, and covered courts erected,
wherein it might be practised without any interruption
from the weather. In the sixteenth
century tennis-courts were common in England,
and the establishment of such places
countenanced by the example of the monarchs.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have undoubted authority to prove that
Henry VII. was a tennis player. In a MS.
register of his expenditures made in the thirteenth
year of his reign, and preserved in the
remembrancer’s office, this entry occurs:—“Item,
for the king’s loss at tennis, twelve-pence;
for the loss of balls, three-pence.”
Hence one may infer, that the game was played
abroad, for the loss of the balls would hardly
have happened in a tennis court. His son
Henry, who succeeded him, in the early part
of his reign was much attached to this diversion;
which propensity, as Hall assures us,
“being perceived by certayne craftie persons
about him, they brought in Frenchmen and
Lombards to make wagers with hym, and so
he lost muche money; but when he perceyved
theyr crafte, he eschued the company and let
them go.” He did not however give up the
amusement, for we find him, according to the
same historian, in the thirteenth year of his
reign, playing at tennis with the Emperor
Maximilian for his partner, against the prince
of Orange and the marquis of Brandenborow:
“the earl of Devonshire stopped on the prince’s
side, and the lord Edmond on the other side;
and they departed even handes on both sides,
after eleven games fully played.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James I., if not himself a tennis player,
speaks of the pastime with commendation, and
recommends it to his son as a species of exercise
becoming a prince. Charles II. frequently
diverted himself with playing at tennis, and
had particular kind of dresses made for that
purpose. So had Henry VIII. In the wardrobe
rolls we meet with tenes-cotes for the
king, also tennis-drawers and tennis-slippers.</p>

<p class='c006'>A French writer speaks of a damsel Margot,
who resided at Paris in 1424, and played at
hand-tennis with the palm, and also with the
back of her hand, better than any man; and
what is most surprising, adds my author, at
that time the game was played with the naked
hand, or at best with a double glove.—<i>Hoyle</i>—<i>Strutt.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><i>The Scotch Terrier.</i> (<i>Canis terrarius,
variety α.</i>)—It is now impossible to trace
the origin of the terrier, but from the many
characteristics peculiar to itself, we would
almost be induced to consider it a primitive
race. Certain it is, that this dog has been for
many ages assiduously cultivated and trained
to the particular sports to which nature seems
to have so well adapted him. To the fox,
hare, rabbit, badger, polecat, weasel, rat,
mouse, and all other kinds of vermin, he is
a most implacable enemy; he has also a
strong natural antipathy to the domestic cat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The name terrier seems to be derived from
the avidity with which he takes the earth in
pursuit of all those animals which burrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two kinds of terriers,—the rough
haired Scotch and the smooth English.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotch terrier is certainly the purest
in point of breed, and the English seems to
have been produced by a cross from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Scotch terrier is generally low in stature,
seldom more than twelve or fourteen
inches in height, with a strong muscular body
and short and stout legs; his ears small and
half pricked; his head is rather large in proportion
to the size of his body, and the muzzle
considerably pointed; his scent is extremely
acute; so that he can trace the footsteps of
all other animals with certainty; he is generally
of a sand colour or black; dogs of these
colours are certainly the most hardy, and more
to be depended upon; when white or pied, it
is a sure mark of the impurity of the breed.
The hair of the terrier is long, matted, and
hard, over almost every part of his body.
His bite is extremely keen.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are three distinct varieties of the
Scotch terrier, viz. the one above described;
another about the same size as the former,
but with the hair much longer and somewhat
flowing, which gives his legs the appearance of
being very short. This is the prevailing breed
of the western islands of Scotland. The third
variety is much larger than the former two,
being generally from fifteen to eighteen inches
in height, with the hair very hard and wiry,
and much shorter than that of the others. It
is from this breed that the best bull-terriers
have been produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>The terrier, amongst the higher order of
sportsmen, is preserved in its greatest purity,
and with the most assiduous attention; and
it seems of the utmost importance not to increase
its size, which would render him unsuitable
for the purpose in which he is employed,
that of entering the earth to drive
out other animals from their burrows, for
which his make, strength, and invincible ardour,
peculiarly fit him. On this account he
is the universal attendant upon a pack of fox
hounds, and though last in the pursuit he is
not the least in value. Indeed a brace of
these dogs is considered indispensable in a
complete fox-hunting establishment, and they
are generally of different sizes, so that the
smallest may enter an earth which will not
admit the other. As soon as the hounds are
thrown into covert, the terrier becomes the
busiest in the field when endeavouring to find
the fox; whenever the game is started, and
the hounds running breast high, and at their
utmost speed, this active little animal is seldom
far behind, and is sure to be up at the
first check. It is when the fox is supposed to
have earthed, that the services of the terrier
are most essentially required; he enters with
the utmost eagerness, and soon informs the
ear of the sportsman whether or not he is in,
and at what distance from the mouth, when
he is speedily dug out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principal objection to the reddish coloured
terrier in a pack is, that by juvenile
sportsmen, in the clamour of the chase, they
are frequently hallooed off for a fox.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The English Terrier.</i> (<i>Canis terrarius,
variety β.</i>)—This is a handsome sprightly
dog, and generally black on the back, sides,
and upper part of the head, neck, and tail;
the belly and the throat are of a very bright
reddish brown with a spot of the same colour
over each eye. The hair is short and somewhat
glossy; the tail rather truncated, and
carried slightly upwards; the ears are small,
somewhat erect, and reflected at the tips; the
head is little in proportion to the size of the
body, and the snout is moderately elongated.
This dog, though but small, is very resolute,
and is a determined enemy to all kinds of
game and vermin, in the pursuit and destruction
of which he evinces an extraordinary and
untaught alacrity. Some of the larger English
terriers will even draw a badger from his hole.
He varies considerably in size and strength,
and is to be met with from ten to eighteen
inches in height.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog, or the wire-haired Scotch terrier,
is indispensably necessary to a pack of fox-hounds,
for the purpose of unearthing the
game. From the greater length of leg, from
his general lightness, and the elegant construction
of his body, he is more adapted for running,
and of course better enabled to keep up
with the pack than the Scotch terrier.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel, in his Rural Sports, mentions
a match against time with a terrier, which
took place in 1794, in which a small dog ran
six miles: the first mile in two minutes, the
second in four, the third in six, the fourth in
eight, and the fifth and sixth in eighteen minutes,—an
immense falling off, considering
his wonderful speed, and the known stoutness
of the terrier. We doubt there has been
some unsteadiness either in the watch or
watch-holder. He afterwards ran six miles
in thirty-two minutes.—<i>Brown.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The sailing clubs upon the Thames, comprise
the Royal Sailing Society—the Royal

Throughout the season several cups and prizes
are annually given; and the severe and spirited
contests between the beautiful small craft
which form these fancy fleets, are highly interesting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sailing matches on the river are divided
into two classes—one above, and the
other below the bridges. The smaller yachts,
ranging from six to twenty-six tons, are commonly
entered for the former, while a larger
class contend for prizes sailed for between
Greenwich and Gravesend.</p>

<p class='c006'>These elegant and truly national amusements,
appear to be rapidly gaining a prominent
place in the list of fashionable recreations;
and aquatic sports now occupy that
dull and sombre season, from the period hunting

swelling, it is called a thorough-pin. It is an
indication of considerable work, but, except it
be of very great size, it is rarely attended by
lameness. The mode of treatment must
resemble that recommended for wind-galls.
Although thorough-pin cannot be pronounced
to be unsoundness, yet it behoves the buyer
to examine well a horse with thoroughpin,
and to ascertain whether undue work may not
have injured him in other respects.—<i>The

<p class='c006'>Horses are thrown down by means of hobbles.
The hobble is about two feet in length,
two inches and five-eighths in width, and
about a quarter of an inch thick. It is
formed by a strong piece of leather, about
four feet in length, which, being doubled, has
a strong iron buckle included at one end, and
firmly sewed in. About four inches and a
half further back, a large iron ring is to be
sewed in, in the same manner, for the purpose
of allowing a strong rope to pass through it
easily. The ring, or rather the part so named,
may be made straight where it is sewed into
the leather, and the rest may be rounded.
The remaining part of the leather is to be
strongly sewed together, which will make the
thickness of it what we have before described.
Several holes are to be punched at
this end of the hobble, to admit the tongue
of the buckle when it is put round the horse’s
leg. On the under side of the hobble, a
piece of thinner and wider leather is to be
fixed, extending from the part where the ring
is attached to about half an inch beyond the
extremity of the buckle; this is intended to
prevent the latter from galling the horse’s
leg. The rope should be strong, not twisted
tight, but made flexible, like a bell-rope, and
about six yards in length. One end of the
rope is to be firmly and permanently attached
to the ring of one of the hobbles, and this
hobble must be placed on the fore-leg, opposite
to the side on which the horse is to be
thrown. If the hobble to which the rope is
attached is placed on the left fore-leg, the other
end of the rope is to be passed first through
the ring of that on the left hind-leg, then
through that on the right hind-leg, next
through that on the right fore-leg, and lastly,
through the ring, where the rope is attached,
that is, the left fore-leg hobble.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this contrivance it will be readily seen
that the legs of the horse may be drawn together,
so that if pushed or forced towards the
right side, he must of necessity fall. Three
men are generally required to pull the rope,
in order to draw the legs together; and to
render this more easy, the hind-legs should be
placed under him as much as possible before
any attempt is made to pull the rope. The
horse should have blinds, or have his eyes covered
with a piece of rug, before the hobbles
are put on; it may be necessary, also, to
twitch him, and hold up the fore-leg while the
hind-leg hobble is putting on. But the twitch
must be removed before he is thrown, and not
used unless absolutely necessary. The men
who are to pull the rope should stand within
two yards of the horse, as they then pull with
double the force they would at a distance of
four yards, their power then having a tendency
to draw the legs off the ground, and
upwards, which causes him to fall more quickly.
One man should stand at the rump, on the
left side, to push him when the legs are
drawn up together; and one man should hold
him steadily by the head, standing in front of
him; and as soon as the horse is down, that
man should throw himself on the neck, and
incline the nose upward, by lifting the halter;
thus he can keep the head and neck down
without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Girard, in his Traité du Pied, has proposed
an improvement in throwing horses,
which is very simple, and should always be
employed: but it requires an additional assistant,
or two would still be better. If the
horse is to be thrown on the right side, a long
piece of web, or a rope, is to be fastened round
the right fore arm, close up to the elbow.
The other end is then to be passed over the
withers, and held at a little distance by one
or two men. The force which is applied in
this way will cause the horse to fall more
readily, and with more certainty, and exactly
in the situation where he is required to be
thrown. This contrivance, therefore, is extremely
useful in confined places, where there
is just room enough to throw a horse, and no
more. The horse being thrown down, and
his legs closely drawn together, the end of the
hobble rope is to be passed under the hobble
rings, between the fore and hind legs, and secured
with a hitch, as it is termed, so that he
cannot separate them again until the hobbles
are unbuckled, and then they all may be
taken away at once, and the horse suffered to
get up.</p>

<p class='c006'>In letting the horse get up again, the hobbles
must be unbuckled cautiously, beginning
with the under fore and hind one. These
should be unbuckled gently, and not jerked,
as that would cause the horse to struggle, and
render it difficult to take them off, or the leg
might get loose, and he may thus hurt one of
the assistants, who happens to be standing incautiously
within the stroke of his fore or hind
leg. I have seen hobbles in which the tongues
were movable, so that by drawing them out
with a pair of pincers the hobbles were all
taken off at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>In performing operations upon the horse, it
is not only necessary to throw him down as I
have described, but in firing the outside of the
fore leg, for example, in the pastern, the hobble
must be taken off, and the leg secured by
means of a web passed round the leg above
the knee, and secured to the upper hind leg,
immediately above the hock, or it may be secured
to the under fore leg; perhaps both
these contrivances would be found useful in
strong horses that struggle much. In firing
the inside of the fore leg, that is, the under
fore leg, nothing more is necessary than to
take it out of the hobble, and draw it forwards
by means of a web passed round the hoof, or
the pastern.</p>

<p class='c006'>Horses, however, have sufficient power to
extend even the under fore leg considerably,
unless a man lies on the shoulder, which
should always be avoided. It is better to restrain
the leg, by passing a web round it above
the knee, and fastening the other end to the
hind leg above the hock. If then the other
three legs are drawn backward, by means of
the hobble rope, the under fore leg will be
sufficiently exposed for any operation that
may be required. In firing the upper hind
leg in the pastern, it is necessary to take off
the hobble; but the leg must first be secured
by means of a web, fastened above the hock,
and the other end brought forward, and, under
a collar of web, passed round the neck, close
to the shoulder. The leg may thus be effectually
restrained; but, as an additional

<p class='c006'>The female builds her nest generally in
bushes; it is composed of dried grass, with a
little earth or clay intermixed, and lined with
rotten wood; she lays five or six eggs of a
pale-blue colour, marked with dusky spots.
Although this species is not considered with
us as migratory, it has, nevertheless, been observed
in some places in great numbers during
the spring and summer, where not one was
to be seen in the winter, which has induced
an opinion that they either shift their quarters
entirely, or take shelter in the more retired
parts of the woods. The throstle is
migratory in France. M. de Buffon says that
it appears in Burgundy about the end of September,
before the redwing and fieldfare, and
that it feeds upon the ripe grapes, and sometimes
does much damage to the vineyard. The
females of all the thrush kind are very similar
to the males, and differ chiefly in a less
degree of brilliancy in the colours.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Opposite my study windows at Lee, I observed
last summer, a missel thrush fly boldly
at a carrion-crow, and persecute him with bill
and wing till he seemed glad to leave the
field. This, however, is far outdone by the
account M. Le Vaillant gives of a party of
missel thrushes attacking and actually vanquishing
an eagle.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Rennie</i>—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Thrush</span>, <i>s.</i> Small, round, superficial ulcerations, which appear first in
the mouth; they may affect every part of the alimentary duct, except
the thick guts; a disease in a horse’s foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a disease of the frog, causing a discharge
of matter from its division or cleft, not
often productive of lameness, especially in the
hind feet, where it is always a consequence of
negligence in the groom, in permitting a horse
to stand in his dung, or upon foul wet litter.
This softens and rots the horny frog, the putrid
and acrid fluids penetrate through the
soaked and rotten horn, and inflame the sensible
frog, causing it to discharge a fetid acrimonious
matter, instead of secreting horn for
its own defence, as it does in the healthy
state.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thrushes in the fore-feet are sometimes occasioned
by contraction of the heels, but more
frequently by the horny box or hoof, considered
all together, becoming too thick, and
consequently inelastic. In this case, the blood
is principally distributed to the sensible frog;
the arteries that supply this not being liable
to compression, being lodged in that elastic
substance of fatty membrane and cartilage, of
which the body of the sensible frog is composed.
This Lafosse supposes to be destitute
of nerves, and that its covering or skin only
is endued with sensibility. I believe this
opinion is correct; for in this part sensibility
is not only unnecessary, but would be injurious.
This part forms a very curious spring,
and is constructed in a manner that is truly
wonderful. It is composed of fatty matter
and cartilage, which are so distributed, that
the more the frog is compressed, the nearer
the cartilages approach each other; thus the
frog becomes denser and denser, while its
elasticity increases in a similar ratio. When
it is compressed to the greatest degree, the
effect is imparted to the lateral cartilages, and
these bodies impart it to the heels, and quarters
or sides of the hoof, and thus it is that
the motions of the hoof are produced. To
admit of this motion of the hoof, which is the
only one that takes place, the elastic membranes
yield in a very slight degree, which diminishes
from the heel to the toe, but is sufficient
for the economy of the foot. The
treatment of thrush must depend altogether
upon the cause which produces it. When in
the hind foot, and occasioned by filthiness, the
cause must be removed, and then the disorder
may cease; but this is not always the case,
for the thrush sometimes has proceeded so far
as to produce ulceration of the sensible frog,
which then requires to be dressed with a solution
of blue vitriol, or oxymel of verdigris.
Before this is done, the cleft of the frog should
be thoroughly cleansed to the bottom by means
of tow; and if there is any ragged horn covering
a diseased part, it should be completely
removed. One of these dressings, when it is
properly done, is sufficient for the cure. Some
tar, or hoof-ointment, such as has been prescribed
in the chapter on contracted heels,
may be applied hot, to promote the regeneration
of horn, and to defend it from moisture.
In cases where the frog has become very tender
or rotten, I have found it necessary to
apply a mixture of tar and sulphuric acid,
which is made by adding one ounce, by weight,
of sulphuric acid to one pound of melted tar,
and stirring the mixture for some time. As
to the thrush in the fore-feet, the treatment
is different. Here also the cause must be
first removed, which is, an undue determination
of blood to the frog, in consequence of
the compression the sensible foot suffers from
a contraction of the heels; or from a superabundance
of horny matter generally in the
crust, and often in the sole also. The motion
which I have described as constantly going
on in the hoof, will now appear to be an
essential provision in that part; for the heels,
as they contract, become deficient in, and at
length totally lose, their elasticity. When
the frog, under this circumstance, comes down
upon the ground and receives pressure, the
pain the animal feels from the ineffectual attempt
thus made to expand the inelastic and
inflexible heels, causes him to lift the frog a
little, and go principally on the toe; hence
the stumbling and falling so common in this
case. This kind of thrush then is to be considered
rather as useful than otherwise; and
by attempting to stop it by those preparations
which are usually employed, the lameness is
often increased. The only thing to be done
is to rasp the heels and quarters, thin the
soles, cover the frog with tar ointment, and
wrap the foot in an emollient poultice; in
slight cases, complete and permanent relief
will be thus afforded. Should the thrush
continue after the hoof has been well soaked
with the poultice, and especially if the frog is
very tender and rotten, apply the mixture of
tar and sulphuric acid. Egyptiacum, either
alone or with a small portion (a few drops to
two ounces) of sulphuric acid, has been recommended.
In old thrushes, physic may be
useful, and some alterative medicine. Sometimes
a run at grass is necessary in moist
ground, and a horse may often be worked
while he is thus kept. In bad cases, palliation
only can be expected, unless a new hoof
be obtained of a better kind, by rasping the
quarters and thinning the sole, until spots of
blood appear; and then, after stopping the
feet with tar-ointment, turning the horse to
grass.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thrushes may happen in the fore-feet
merely from filthiness, and may then be
cured as they are in the hind-feet; but this
is not a common occurrence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third kind of thrush I have to describe
is not so common as the two former,
and is no other than an incipient canker. It
may always be cured by removing from the
frog every bit of horn that is detached from
the sensible frog, and by which a diseased
part may be concealed, and then applying to
the affected part a saturated solution of blue
vitriol, or egyptiacum, with a few drops of
sulphuric acid. Cleanliness must be carefully
attended to; and when the disease of the
frog has been cured, tar, or hoof-ointment,
may be employed to promote the regeneration
of horn.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This diminutive tribe is distinguished by a
peculiar degree of sprightliness and vivacity,
to which may be added a degree of strength
and courage which by no means agrees with
its appearance. Birds of this class are perpetually
in motion; they run with great celerity
along the branches of trees, searching for
their food in every little cranny, where the
eggs of insects are deposited, which are their
favourite food. During spring they are frequently
observed to be very busy among the
opening buds, searching for caterpillars, and
are thus actively employed in preventing the
mischiefs that would arise from a too great increase
of those destructive insects, whilst at
the same time they are intent on the means
of their own preservation; they likewise eat
small pieces of raw meat, particularly fat, of
which they are very fond. None of this kind
have been observed to migrate; they sometimes
make short flittings from place to place
in quest of food, but never entirely leave us.
They are very bold and daring, and will attack
birds much larger than themselves with great
intrepidity.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds are very widely spread over
every part of the old continent, from the northern
parts of Europe to the Cape of Good
Hope, as well as to the farthest parts of India,
China, and Japan; they are likewise found
throughout the vast continent of America, and
in several of the West India islands. They
are every where prolific, even to a proverb,
laying a great number of eggs, which they attend

crawls; the toad is accounted venomous.</p>

<p class='c006'>I remember some years ago getting up into
a mulberry-tree, and finding in the fork of the
two main branches a large toad almost embedded
in the bark of the tree, which had
grown over it so much, that he was quite unable
to extricate himself, and would probably
in time be completely covered over with the
bark. Indeed, as the tree increased in size,
there seems to be no reason why the toad
should not in process of time become embedded
in the tree itself, as was the case with the
end of an oak rail that had been inserted into
an elm-tree, which stood close to a public footpath.
This, being broken off and grown over,
was, on the tree being felled and sawn in two,
found nearly in the centre of it. The two circumstances
together may explain the curious
fact of toads having been found alive in the
middle of trees, by showing that the bark having
once covered them, the process of growth
in the tree would annually convey the toad
more nearly to the centre of it, as happened
with the piece of oak-rail; and by showing
that toads, and probably other amphibia, can
exist on the absorption of fluids by the skin
alone. This is confirmed by the following
fact. A gentleman informed me that he put
a toad into a small flower pot, and secured it
so that no insect could penetrate into it, and
then buried it in the ground at a sufficient
depth to protect it from the influence of frost.
At the end of twenty years he took it up, and
found the toad increased in size, and apparently
healthy. Dr. Townson, in his tracts on the
respiration of the amphibia, proves, I think satisfactorily,
from actual experiment, that, while
those animals with whose economy we are best
acquainted receive their principal supply of
liquids by the mouth, the frog and salamander
tribes take in theirs through the skin alone;
all the aqueous fluid which they take in being
absorbed by the skin, and all they reject being
transpired through it. He found that a frog
absorbed nearly its own weight of water in the
short space of an hour and a half, and that by
being merely placed on blotting-paper well
soaked with water; and it is believed that they
never discharge it, except when they are disturbed
or pursued, and then they only eject
it to lighten their bodies, and facilitate their
escape. That the moisture thus imbibed is
sufficient to enable some of the amphibia to
exist without any other food, there cannot I
think be a reasonable doubt; and if this is admitted,
the circumstance of toads being found
alive in the centre of trees is accounted for by
this and the preceding facts related.</p>

<p class='c006'>In additional proof however of what has been
advanced, I may mention that the respectable
proprietor of some extensive coal-mines in
Staffordshire, informed me that his men, in
working into a stratum of thick coal at a very
considerable depth, found three live eels in a
small deposit of water in the centre of a block
of coal, which died as soon as they were taken
out of it. Another case was mentioned to
me by an eminent physician. A wet spot had
always been observed on a freestone mantel-piece,
which afterwards cracked at that place,
and upon its being taken down, a toad was
found in it, dead; but its death was probably
owing to the want of that moisture which it
had been enabled to imbibe when the stone
was in the quarry, and which gradually lessened
by the action of the fire, as from the
moisture which appeared on that part of the
mantel-piece, some time after it was put up,
there seems but little reason to doubt that the
toad was alive at that time.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It is a curious fact that toads are so numerous
in the island of Jersey, that they have
become a term of reproach for its inhabitants,
the word ‘Crepaud’ being frequently applied
to them; while in the neighbouring island of
Guernsey not a toad is to be found, though
they have frequently been imported. Indeed,
certain other islands have always been privileged
in this respect. Ireland is free from venomous
animals, of course by the aid of St.
Patrick. The same was affirmed of Crete in
olden times, being the birth place of Jupiter.
The Isle of Man is said also to be free from
venomous creatures. The Mauritius, and I
believe one of the Balearic islands, enjoys the
same immunity.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Tonics, according to Murray, are those substances

not mechanical, as was once conceived; they
act not on the simple solids, increasing their
tension or tone, but on the living fibre, and
are merely powerful stimulants permanent in
their operation. By producing a gradual excitement,
they give vigour to the actions of
the system, and as that excitement is gradually
produced, it is in like manner gradually diminished,
and the habitual stimuli continuing
to operate, diminished action does not succeed.
Where tonics however are given in excess,
are used unnecessarily, or for too long a time,
they weaken the powers of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tonics may be divided into minerals and
vegetables; the former are generally considered
the most powerful, and I believe are at
this time generally preferred, not only on account
of their supposed superior efficacy, but
likewise, probably, from their being less expensive,
and the dose less bulky and inconvenient.</p>

are habituated only to healthy dogs, will smile
at such a head line; but were they in London,
or other large cities and towns, where dogs are
petted and immured in hot apartments night
and day; where also they are gorged with the

and withal are probably descended from
a long lineage of parents equally unnaturally
treated; they would see sufficient of these
effects of an imperfect digestion, to make them
aware that this article is perfectly in place;
and the remarks which follow are in unison
with the general intention of these pages, to
let nothing pass unnoticed, which a long and
critical attention to the habits and diseases of
these animals renders necessary to be guarded
against and remedied. In the dogs I have described,
nothing is more common to find than
carious teeth, insufferably fœtid; others displaced,
preventing mastication; or an immense
accumulation of tartar, which covers them,
erodes the gums, and makes the animal insufferably
offensive. The veterinarian will
often be called on to remedy these evils: the
decayed teeth he must remove, and the displaced
ones also; the tartaric deposit he must
likewise completely scale off with proper dental
instruments; for the accumulation is not
only most unpleasant to the owners, but injurious
to the dogs, by its septic tendency, and
its invariably ending in the destruction of the
teeth. The ulcerations are best removed by
touching them with a mixture of a proper
strength made from the solution of the chloride
of soda with water: by the use of this,
these ulcers will quickly heal; and the continuance
of it will do much to remove the remaining
fœtor, and stop the further deposit of
tartar, particularly if coupled with a corresponding
improvement in the general treatment
of the animal.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Training Racehorses.</i>—A month is the
least time that can be allowed to draw the
horse’s body clear, and to refine his wind to
that degree of perfection that is attainable by
art.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is first necessary to take an exact view
of his body, whether he be high or low in
flesh, and it is also necessary to consider whether
he be dull or heavy, or brisk and lively
when abroad. If he appear dull and heavy
and there is reason to suppose it is owing to
too hard riding, or, as the jockeys express it,
to some grease that has been dissolved in exercise,
and has not been removed by scouring,
then the proper remedy is half an ounce of diapente,
given in a pint of good sack; this will
at once remove the cause, and revive the
creature’s spirits. After this, for the first
week of the month, he is to be fed with oats,
bread, and split beans, sometimes the one and
sometimes the other, as he likes best, and
always leaving some in the locker, that he
may feed at leisure whilst left alone. At
feeding time, whatever is left of this must be
removed and fresh given, by these means the
creature will soon become high-spirited, wanton,
and full of play. Every day he must be
rode out on airing, and every other day it
will be proper to increase his exercise, but
not so as to make him perspire too much.
The beans and oats should be put in a bag,
and beaten till the hulls are all off, and then
winnowed clean, and the bread, instead of being
chipped in the common way, should have
the crust cut clean off. If the horse be in
good health and in spirits, when taken up for
its month’s preparation the diapente must be
omitted, and the chief business will be to give
him good food, and so much exercise as will
keep him in wind, without over-sweating or
tiring him; when he takes larger exercise afterwards,
towards the end of the month, it
will be proper to have some horses to run
against him. This will put him on his mettle,
and the beating them will give him spirits:
this, however, is to be cautiously observed,
that he has not a blood heat (at full speed)
given him for ten days or a fortnight before
the race, and that the last heat that is given
him the day before the race must be in his
clothes, this will make him run with much
more vigour, when stripped for the race, and
feeling the cold wind on every part.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the second week, the horse should have
the same food, and more exercise. In the
last fortnight, he must have dried oats, that
have been hulled by beating. After this,
they are to be wetted in a quantity of whites
of eggs beaten up, and then laid out in the
sun to dry, and when as dry as before the
horse is to have them. This sort of food is
very light of digestion, and very good for the
creature’s wind. The beans in this case
should be given more sparingly, and the bread
should be made of three parts wheat, and one
part beans; if he should become costive, under
this course, he must then have some ale and
whites of eggs beaten together, this will cool
him and keep his body moist. In the last
week, the mash is to be omitted, and barley-water
given him in its place every day until
the day before the race; he should have his
fill of hay at first, and then given more sparingly,
that he may have time to digest it, and
on the morning of the race-day he must have
a toast or two soaked in sack, and the same
just before he is let out to the field. This is
an excellent method, because the two extremes
of fullness and fasting are at this time to be
equally avoided, the one hurting his wind,
and the other occasioning faintness that may
make him lose. After he has had his food,
the litter is to be shook up, and the stable
kept quiet that he may be disturbed by nothing
till he is taken out to run.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The training of Jockeys.</i>—John Arnall,
when rider to his Royal Highness the Prince
of Wales, was desired to reduce himself as
much as he possibly could, to enable him to
ride some favourite horse, without his carrying
more weight than was agreed upon; in consequence
of which, he abstained from animal
and even farinaceous food for eight succeeding
days, and the only substitute was now and
then a piece of apple; he was not injured by
it at the time, and is now in good health:
added to which, Dennis Fitzpatrick, a person
at this time continually employed as a rider,
declares that he is less fatigued by riding, and
has more strength to contend with a determined
horse, in a severe race, when moderately
reduced, than when allowed to live as
he pleased, although he never weighs more
than nine stone, and frequently has reduced
himself to seven stone seven pounds.</p>

    <div>REPLY TO SIR JOHN SINCLAIR’S QUERIES BY</div>
    <div>MR. SANDEVIR OF NEWMARKET.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How long does the training of jockeys continue?</p>

<p class='c006'>With those in high repute as riders, in a
greater or lesser degree, from about three
weeks before Easter to the end of October,
but a week or ten days are quite sufficient
for a rider to reduce himself from the weight
he is naturally of, to sometimes a stone and a
half below it.</p>

<p class='c006'>What food do they live on, both solid and
liquid, and what quantities are allowed them
of each?</p>

<p class='c006'>For breakfast, a small piece of bread and
butter, with tea, in moderation. Dinner is
taken in a very sparing way, a very small
piece of pudding, and less meat, and when
fish is to be obtained, neither one nor the
other are to be allowed; wine and water is
their usual beverage, in the proportion of one
part wine to two of water. Tea in the afternoon,
with little or no bread and butter, and
no supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>What exercise do they get, and what
hours of rest?</p>

<p class='c006'>After breakfast, having sufficiently loaded
themselves with clothes, that is, five or six
waistcoats, two coats, and as many pair of
breeches, a severe walk is taken, from ten to
fifteen or sixteen miles; after their return
home, dry clothes are substituted for those
that are made very wet and uncomfortable by
sweat, and, if much fatigued, some of them
will lie down for an hour before dinner; after
which, no severe exercise is taken, but the
remaining part of the day is spent in that
way that may be most agreeable to themselves;
they generally go to bed by nine
o’clock, and continue there till six or seven
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Are they purged, and what purges and
other medicines are given them?</p>

<p class='c006'>Some of them that do not like excessive
walking, have recourse to purgative medicines,
two ounces of Glauber’s salts is the
usual dose, and it is very seldom that any
other medicine is had recourse to.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Sandevir would recommend a similar
process to reduce corpulency in either sex, as,
from experience, he perceives, that the constitution
does not appear to be injured by it,
but he is apprehensive that hardly any person
could be prevailed upon to submit to such
severe discipline, that had not been inured
to it from his infancy.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The art of training for athletic exercises
consists in purifying the body and strengthening
its powers by certain processes, which thus
qualify a person for the accomplishment of
laborious exertions. It was known to the
ancients, who paid much attention to the
means of augmenting corporeal vigour and
activity; and accordingly among the Greeks
and Romans certain rules of regimen and exercise
were prescribed to the candidates for
gymnastic celebrity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great object of training for running or
boxing matches, is to increase the muscular
strength and to improve the free action of the
lungs or wind of the person subjected to the
process, which is done by medicines, regimen,
and exercise. That these objects can be accomplished
is evident from the nature of the
human system. It is well known (for it has
been demonstrated by experiments) that every
part of the firmest bones is successively absorbed
and deposited. The bones and their
ligaments, the muscles and their tendons—all
the finer and all the more flexible parts of
the body, are as continually renewed, and as
properly a secretion, as the saliva that flows
from the mouth, or the moisture that bedews
the surface. The health of all the parts and
their soundness of structure, depends upon this
perpetual absorption and perpetual renovation;
and exercise, by promoting at once absorption
and secretion, promotes life without hurrying
it, renovates all the parts, and preserves them
apt and fit for every office. When the human
frame is thus capable of being altered and
renovated, it is not surprising that the art of
training should be carried to a degree of perfection
almost incredible; and that by certain
processes the breath, strength, and courage of
man should be so greatly improved as to enable
him to perform the most laborious undertakings.
That such effects have been produced
is unquestionable, being fully exemplified
in the astonishing exploits of our most
celebrated pedestrians, which are the infallible
results of preparatory discipline.</p>

<p class='c006'>The skilful trainer attends to the state of
the bowels, the lungs, and the skin; and he
uses such means as will reduce the fat, and at
the same time invigorate the muscular fibres.
The patient is purged by drastic medicines;
he is sweated by walking under a weight of
clothes, and by lying between feather beds;
his limbs are roughly rubbed; his diet is beef
or mutton; his drink strong ale; and he is
gradually inured to exercise by repeated trials
in walking and running. By attenuating the
fat, emptying the cellular substance, hardening
the muscular fibre, and improving the
breath, a man of the ordinary frame may be
made to fight for one hour with the utmost
exertion of strength and courage, or to go over
one hundred miles in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most effectual process for training is
that practised by Captain Barclay, and the
particular mode which he has adopted has not
only been sanctioned by professional men, but
has met with the unqualified approbation of
amateurs. The following statement, therefore,
contains the most approved rules, and it
is presented to the reader as the result of
much experience, founded on the theoretic
principles of the art.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pedestrian, who may be supposed in
tolerable condition, enters upon his training
with a regular course of physic, which consists
of three doses. Glauber’s salts are
generally preferred, and from one ounce and
a half to two ounces are taken each time,
with an interval of four days between each
dose. After having gone through the course
of physic, he commences regular exercise,
which is gradually increased as he proceeds in
the training. When the object in view is to
accomplish a pedestrian match, his regular
exercise may be from twenty-four miles a-day.
He must rise at five in the morning, run half
a mile at the top of his speed up hill, and
then walk six miles at a moderate pace, coming
in about seven to breakfast, which should
consist of beefsteaks or mutton chops under
done, with stale bread and old beer. After
breakfast he must again walk six miles at a
moderate pace, and at twelve lie down in bed
without his clothes for half an hour. On
getting up he must walk four miles, and return
by four to dinner, which should also be beefsteaks
or mutton chops, with bread and beer
as at breakfast. Immediately after dinner he
must resume his exercise by running half a
mile at the top of his speed, and walking six
miles at a moderate pace. He takes no more
exercise for that day, but retires to bed about
eight, and next morning proceeds in the same
manner. After having gone in this regular
course for three or four weeks, the pedestrian
must take a four mile sweat, which is produced
by running four miles in flannel at the
top of his speed. Immediately on returning
a hot liquor is prescribed in order to promote
the perspiration, of which he must drink one
English pint. It is termed the sweating liquor,
and it is composed of the following ingredients,
viz. one ounce of carraway seed,
half an ounce of coriander seed, an ounce of
root liquorice, and half an ounce of sugar-candy,
mixed with two bottles of cider, and
boiled down to one half. He is then put to
bed in his flannels, and being covered with six
or eight pairs of blankets and a feather bed,
must remain in this state from twenty-five to
thirty minutes, when he is to be taken out
and rubbed perfectly dry. Being then well
wrapped in a great coat, he walks out gently
for two miles to breakfast, which on such
occasions should consist of a roasted fowl.
He afterwards proceeds with his usual exercise.
These sweats are continued weekly,
till within a few days of the performance of
the match, or in other words he must undergo
three or four of these operations. If
the stomach of the pedestrian be foul, an
emetic or two must be given about a week
before the conclusion of the training, and he
is now supposed to be in the highest condition.
Besides his usual or regular exercise, a
person under training ought to employ himself
in the intervals in every kind of exertion
which tends to activity, such as cricket, bowls,
throwing quoits, &amp;c., that during the whole
day both body and mind may be constantly
occupied.</p>

<p class='c006'>The diet or regimen is the next point of
consideration, and it is very simple. As the intention
of the trainer is to preserve the strength
of the pedestrian, he must take care to keep
him in good condition by nourishing food. Animal
diet is alone prescribed, and beef and mutton
are preferred. The lean of fat beef cooked
in steaks, with very little salt, is the best, and
it should be rather underdone than otherwise.
Mutton being reckoned easy of digestion, may
be occasionally given, to vary the diet and gratify
the taste. The legs of fowl are highly
esteemed. It is preferable to have the meat
broiled, as much of its nutritive quality is lost
by roasting or boiling. Biscuit and stale bread
are the only preparations of vegetable matter
which are permitted to be given; and every
thing inducing flatulency must be carefully
avoided. Veal and lamb are never allowed,
nor pork, which operates as a laxative on some
people; and all fat or greasy substances are prohibited,
as they induce bile and consequently
injure the stomach. But it has been proved
by experience that the lean of meat contains
more nourishment than the fat, and in every
case the most substantial food is preferable to
any other kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, or potatoes,
are never given, as they are watery and
of difficult digestion. On the same principle
fish must be avoided, and, besides, they are
not sufficiently nutritious. Neither butter nor
cheese is allowed; the one being very indigestible,
and the other apt to turn rancid on the
stomach. Eggs are also forbidden, excepting
the yolk taken raw in the morning. And it
must be remarked, that salt, spices and all
kinds of seasonings, with the exception of vinegar,
are prohibited.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to liquors, they must always
be taken cold; and home-brewed beer, old but
not bottled, is the best. A little red wine,
however, may be given to those who are not
fond of malt liquor, but never more than half
a pint after dinner. Too much liquor swells
the abdomen, and of course injures the breath.
The quantity of beer, therefore, should not exceed
three pints during the whole day, and it
must be taken with breakfast and dinner, no
supper being allowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Water is never given alone, and ardent spirits
are strictly prohibited, however diluted.
It is an established rule to avoid liquids as
much as possible, and no more liquor of any
kind is allowed to be taken than what is merely
requisite to quench the thirst. Milk is never
allowed, as it curdles on the stomach. Soups
are not used; nor is any thing liquid taken
warm but gruel or broth, to promote the operation
of the physic, and the sweating liquor
mentioned above. The broth must be cooled,
in order to take off the fat, when it may be
again warmed, or beef tea may be used in the
same manner, with little or no salt. In the
days between the purges, the pedestrian must
be fed as usual, strictly adhering to the nourishing
diet, by which he is invigorated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Profuse sweating is resorted to as an expedient
for removing the superfluities of flesh
and fat. Three or four sweats are generally
requisite, and they may be considered the severest
part of the process.</p>

<p class='c006'>Emetics are only prescribed if the stomach
be disordered, which may sometimes happen,
when due care is not taken to proportion the
quantity of food to the digestive powers; but,
in general, the quantity of aliment is not limited
by the trainer, but left entirely to the
discretion of the pedestrian, whose appetite
should regulate him in this respect. Although
the chief parts of the training system depend
upon sweating, exercise, and feeding, yet the
object to be obtained by the pedestrian would
be defeated, if they were not adjusted to each
other, and to his constitution. The skilful
trainer will, therefore, constantly study the
progress of his art, by observing the effects of
the processes separately, and in combination.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to fix a precise period from
the completion of the training process, as it
depends upon the condition of the pedestrian;
but from two to three months, in most cases,
will be sufficient, especially if he be in tolerable
condition at the commencement, and
possessed of sufficient perseverance and courage
to submit cheerfully to the privations
and hardships to which he must unavoidably
be subjected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The criterion by which it may be known
whether a man be in good condition, or, what
is the same thing, has been properly trained,
is the state of the skin, which becomes smooth,
elastic, and well coloured, or transparent. The
flesh is also firm, and the person trained feels
himself light and full of spirits. But in the
progress of the training, his condition may be as
well ascertained by the effect of the sweats, which
cease to reduce his weight, and by the manner
in which he performs one mile at the top
of his speed, as to walk a hundred; and therefore,
if he performs this short distance well,
it may be concluded that his condition is
perfect, or that he has derived all the advantages
which can possibly result from the
training process.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manner of training jockeys is different
from that which is applicable to pedestrians
and pugilists. In regard to jockeys, it is
generally wasting with the view to reduce
their weight. This is produced by purgatives,
emetics, sweats, and starvation. Their bodily
strength is of no importance, as they have
only to manage the reins of the courser, whose
fleetness depends upon the weight he carries;
and the muscular power of the rider is of
no consequence to the race, provided it be
equal to the fatigue of a three or four mile
heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Training for pugilism is nearly the same
as for pedestrianism, the object in both being
principally to obtain additional wind and
strength. But it will be best illustrated by a
detail of the process observed by Cribb, the
Champion of England, preparatory to his
grand battle with Molineaux, which took
place on the 29th of September, 1811.</p>

<p class='c006'>The champion arrived at Ury on the 7th of
July of that year. He weighed sixteen stone;
and from his mode of living in London, and the
confinement of a crowded city, he had become
corpulent, big-bellied, full of gross humours,
and short-breathed, and it was with
difficulty he could walk ten miles. He first
went through a course of physic, which consisted
of three doses; but for two weeks he
walked about as he pleased, and generally
traversed the woods and plantations with a
fowling-piece in his hand. The reports of his
musket resounded everywhere through the
groves and the hollows of that delightful
place, to the great terror of the magpies and
wood-pigeons.</p>

<p class='c006'>After amusing himself in this way for about
a fortnight, he then commenced his regular
walking exercise, which at first was about
ten or twelve miles a day. It was soon after
increased to eighteen or twenty; and he ran
regularly, morning and evening, a quarter of
a mile at the top of his speed. In consequence
of his physic and exercise, his weight
was reduced in the course of five weeks, from
sixteen stone to fourteen and nine pounds.
At this period he commenced his sweats, and
took three during the month he remained at
Ury afterwards; and his weight was gradually
reduced to thirteen stone and five
pounds, which was ascertained to be his pitch
of condition, as he could not reduce farther
without weakening.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the course of his training, the champion
went twice to the Highlands, and took
strong exercise. He walked to Mar Lodge,
which is about sixty miles distant from Ury,
where he arrived to dinner on the second
day, being now able to go thirty miles a day
with ease, and probably he could have walked
twice as far if it had been necessary. He remained
in the Highlands about a week each
time, and amused himself with shooting. The
principal advantage which he derived from
these expeditions, was the severe exercise he
was obliged to undergo in following Captain
Barclay. He improved more in strength and
wind by his journeys to the Highlands, than
by any other part of the training process.</p>

<p class='c006'>His diet and drink were the same as used
in the pedestrian regimen, and in other respects
the rules previously laid down were
generally applied to him. That he was
brought to his ultimate pitch of condition,
was evident from the high state of health and
strength in which he appeared when he
mounted the stage to contend with Molineaux,
who has since confessed, that when he
saw his fine condition he totally despaired of
gaining the battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cribb was altogether about eleven weeks
under training, but he remained only nine
weeks at Ury. Besides his regular exercise,
he was occasionally employed in sparring at
Stonehaven, where he gave lessons in the
pugilistic art. He was not allowed much
rest, but was constantly occupied in some
active employment. He enjoyed good spirits,
being at the time fully convinced that he
would beat his antagonist. He was managed,
however, with great address, and the result
corresponded with the wishes of his friends.—<i>Sporting

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Trap</span>, <i>s.</i> A snare set for thieves or vermin; an ambush, a stratagem to
betray or catch unawares; a play at which a ball is driven with a
stick.</p>

<p class='c006'>I place my trap a few yards to the right
or the left of the partridge’s nest (so that it
may not catch the parent bird) but plainly in
view, so that when the magpie approaches it
cannot fail to see the bait. As magpies are
fond of eggs, nothing can form a better bait
(particularly in the breeding season) than a
hen’s egg, which should be perforated at each
end, the contents blown out, and a small
twig run through it into the ground, in order
to give the magpie some trouble to get it off;
and while it is endeavouring to pull it away,
its feet should be on the bridge of the trap,
the bait being placed at the requisite distance
for that purpose. The plunderer is sure to
be caught. The mere shell of the egg answers
better for the purpose of a bait than if
it contained its original contents, and it is
thus more easily fastened to the requisite
spot. I repeat, that the square is much preferable
to the semicircular trap, as the latter
is more apt to miss the thief, owing to its
form.</p>

<p class='c006'>If an egg be not at hand, or easily obtained,
a piece of raw meat will answer the purpose,
and will form a good bait:—a magpie is not
very particular in its food.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the kite or the buzzard be the object of
consideration, the trap should be placed precisely
in the same manner, but the bait
should be a pigeon, a small rabbit, (or a piece
of either) or any of the smaller kind of birds,
or a piece of raw meat or liver will answer
the purpose. The bait should be fastened,
and if a few feathers are scattered about, it
will be more easily perceived by these birds—they
will discern it indeed at a great distance.—Kites
and buzzards, though very mischievous,
are few in number, and do not approach
the human habitation with the same
familiarity as the magpie or the crow. They
are fond of being able to see a great distance
around them, as if to prevent surprise; and
for this reason they may be often seen, when
they alight on the ground, to take their station
on some hillock or eminence, on downs
or other open places, whence they can survey
the surrounding country. Wherever it is
perceived that these birds frequent or haunt,
the traps should of course be placed. Let it
be further understood, that the application of
these remarks is not intended to be confined
to the breeding season. Whenever vermin,
of any kind, are discovered, they should be
trapped or destroyed—there is no mode so certain
as the steel trap, when properly prepared
and set.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sparrow hawk, the hobby, &amp;c., require
a smaller trap than the kite or the buzzard,
which is, however, to be prepared and placed
in the same manner, and baited with a sparrow,
lark, or other small bird (excepting the swallow
tribe, which birds of prey refuse) and a
few of its feathers scattered about for the
purpose of attracting the object to be caught.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the quadrupedal vermin, and
first of all for the polecat, it may be remarked,
that when this animal is suspected of making
free with the eggs of the pheasant or the
partridge, the trap may be prepared for him
precisely in the same manner as already described
for the magpie, and he is sure to be
caught; or should the track to his hole be
discovered, he may be taken by placing the
trap in it, close to the hole, (covered in all
cases, as the most certain means of success,)
with or without the bait, but the latter mode
is preferable; or the deception may be placed
a little out of his track; and perhaps half a
yard out of his track is the better method.
This animal is attracted by the smell of
musk, and therefore the bait may be anointed
with a little of the essence of this strong perfume:
but it will answer the purpose without
it; and the only effect, in fact, that it has, is
merely enabling the polecat to smell or scent
the bait at a greater distance. A trap placed
at the entrance of the hole of the polecat,
without a bait, will take him, if covered in
the manner described in the preceding pages;
but if not concealed, its effective operation
will be very uncertain; with a rat it would
fail: if the trap were so placed that the rat
could not miss it in coming out, he would
form another hole to avoid it, when the calls
of hunger compelled him to leave his hiding
place. The bait for a polecat should be a rat,
a mouse, a bird, entrails, or indeed almost
any animal substance will answer the purpose.—And
what I have stated respecting the
polecat is equally applicable to the stoat, and
to all the weasel tribe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cat, as I have previously stated in a
separate article, is very destructive to game;
for which nothing is a more tempting bait
than a sparrow, lark, &amp;c., and, as these animals
are attracted by valerian, the bait may
be rubbed with it if convenient; but it is not
absolutely necessary, as a cat is easily caught
without that addition. Valerian may, as well
as musk, be obtained at any druggist’s shop.
It will be requisite, of course, to set a larger
trap for a cat than that which is used for a
weasel or a magpie.</p>

<p class='c006'>The caution of rats in approaching a trap
is very well known, and, in fact, those who
attempt to take them in the common way
uniformly fail; an odd one may perhaps be
caught (and that not often) and the business
ends. But when the trap is concealed in a
proper manner, the rats are sure to be caught.—<i>Gamekeeper’s Directory.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Trevis</span>, <i>s.</i> An instrument of restraint for horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trevis is the very utmost limit of restraint,
and is seldom used but by smiths to
shoe very violent and powerful horses: whenever
recourse is had to it, the greatest caution
is necessary to bed and bolster all the parts
that are likely to come in contact with the
body. On the continent I have seen horses
very dexterously shod in this machine, and
apparently put in under no other necessity
than either to avoid labour, or, ridiculous as it
may seem, to prevent the clothes of the smith
from being injured or dirtied by the common
method. Horses have been destroyed by the
trevis, as well as by casting; or, at least, their
aversion to the restraint has been such, that
they have died under their own resistance; it,
however, has a very decided advantage over
casting, as it is seldom the vertebræ are fractured
by it; and it might be so framed, I am
convinced, as to render it a most efficient restraint
for the performance of many operations,
and might be further used as a slinging machine
in many cases requiring suspension, which
might here, by the adjustment of machinery,
be made to act in many ways favourable to the
horse and the practitioner. The side-line is
now very generally used, not only in minor
operations but also in those more important.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

being pulled, looses the cock of the gun. Hair triggers are generally
used in duelling pistols and rifles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let the triggers of all your guns be made
to go nearly alike; for, if one requires too
hard a pull, it is a sad check to shooting; and,
if it goes too easy, you are liable to the accident
of firing the gun before it is fairly
brought to the shoulder. Any tolerable mechanic
may rectify these extremes, by filing,
more or less, the part where the scear catches
the tumbler. The most accurate way to regulate
the pull of a trigger, as well as that of
a cock, is by a small stilliard, which will draw
out and regulate those of twenty guns to the
same focus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The triggers are now kept well in their
places, by the constant pressure of little springs,
and you must therefore push them back before
you can let in your locks.—<i>Hawker.</i>—<i>Vide</i>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Trim</span>, <i>v.</i> To fit out; to dress, to decorate, to shave, to clip.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is necessary here to make some remarks
on the absurd and mischievous practice of
trimming horses’ legs; that is, cutting off
parts which were designed by the Almighty
for a useful purpose, that of defending the
pastern; whereby they expose an important
part to injuries. The fetlock, as it is termed,
is found in all horses, especially in those of
the northern breed, and from its position is an
admirable guard against thorns, furze, flints,
or other bodies, to which the pastern, without
it, is so much exposed. The only excuse for
this foolish practice is, that it is customary,
and makes a horse look clean about the legs;
and this notion is carefully preserved, and
impressed upon the minds of those inexperienced
in horses, by the men employed to operate
on the occasion. To such an extent is
this absurd practice carried, that in Exeter it
has become a distinct profession, for there is
one man I know who appears to make it his
sole employment. The hairs covering the
back part of the legs, and fetlock joint, are
always indicative of the horse’s breed. In
those of northern climates it is strong, abundant,
and an excellent protection against accidents.
In the Arabian and barb it is thin,
silky, and highly ornamental. The English
race-horse being a mixture of the Arab and
the barb, with a very small proportion of the
northern blood, has this ornament in nearly
as great a degree as the Arab or barb. The
English hunter has it in a less degree, but in
sufficient quantity and strength for the defence
of the pastern against furze, thorns, and
flints; but there are many who thin or trim
out the fetlock and pastern in such a manner,
in order to make the horse appear well-bred,
that it is made inadequate to the purpose for
which it was intended. Hence it is that punctures
and wounds in the back part of the
pastern are so common as we find them.
Wounds of the pastern, from the imprudent
practice I have just described, often occasion
severe lameness, and sometimes of considerable
duration. They are generally occasioned
by small thorns, which having entered the
sheath of the tendon, are, from the hardness
of the perforans tendon, turned on their side,
and rendered less injurious than they would
otherwise be; but even then the irritation
they occasion is such as to produce a dreadful
degree of lameness, and even locked jaw.
This severe injury, however, is not common;
more frequently the entrance of the thorn is
effectually resisted by the sheath, so that the
point is turned upward or downward, and the
thorn laid flat on its surface. But most commonly
the thorn is turned in an oblique
direction, by entering the skin, and both the
tendon and its sheath escape injury. Whenever
these accidents occur, it is of the utmost
importance to remove the thorn as speedily
as possible, and this can be done most readily
with the instrument named dissecting forceps.
The thorn will always be found in an oblique
direction, and must be sought for accordingly.
The search will always be successful, if careful,
and in time. After the thorn has been
extracted, an emollient poultice should be
applied as long as it is necessary.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Trolling, in the limited sense of the word,
means taking jack and pike with the gorge
hook; live-bait fishing, when a floated line is
used; and snap-fishing, when the angler so
places his baited hooks, that, immediately he
feels a bite, he strikes with much force, and
generally throws over his head, or drags the
jack or pike on shore, instead of playing his
victim till he is exhausted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Trolling is a valuable branch of fishing,
affording the angler several months’ amusement
during the year, and it may be practised
without danger to the health, when every
other mode of angling ceases to be either profitable
or prudent to follow; for as the winter
approaches, fish seldom rise to the surface of
the water, but leave the sharps, shallows, and
scouers, for the more deep and still parts of
rivers or other waters; the fly-fisherman may
then lay by his tackle till the ensuing spring
is well advanced.—<i>Salter.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This very elegant species is plentifully distributed
through the British waters, and varies
in weight from a few ounces to fifteen or
even thirty pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general shape of trouts is rather long
than broad; in several of the Scotch and Irish
lakes and rivers, they grow so much thicker
than in those of England, that a fish from
eighteen to twenty-two inches will often weigh
from three to five pounds. The trout is a fish
of prey, has a short roundish head, blunt nose,
mouth wide, and filled with teeth, not only in
the jaws, but on the palate and tongue: the
scales are small, their back is ash colour, the
sides yellow, and when in season, is sprinkled
all over the body and covers of the gills with
small beautiful red and black spots; the tail is
broad.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several sorts of trout, differing in
their size, (for in many of the smaller streams
there are trouts that always continue small,
but are very great breeders,) shape, and hue;
but the flesh of the best is either red or yellow
when dressed; the female fish has a smaller
head and deeper body than the male, and is of
superior flavour. In fact the colours of the
trout and the spots vary greatly in different
waters and at distinct seasons, yet each may be
reduced to one species. In Lyndive, a lake in
South Wales, are trout called coch-y-dail, with
red and black spots as big as sixpences; others
unmarked, and of a reddish hue, that sometimes
weigh nearly ten pounds, but are ill-tasted.
In Lough Neagh, in Ireland, are trout
called buddaghs, which rise to thirty pounds;
and some (probably of the same species) are
taken in Ulleswater, in Cumberland, of still
greater weight; and both those are supposed
to be similar with the large trout of the lake
of Geneva, a fish says Mr. Pennant which I
have eaten of more than once, and think very
indifferent.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>A trout taken in Llynallet, in Denbighshire,
which is famous for its excellent kind, was singularly
marked and shaped; it measured seventeen
inches in length, depth three and three
quarters, and weighed one pound ten ounces;
the head thick, nose sharp, both jaws as well
as the head, of a pale brown, blotched with
black; the teeth sharp and strong, dispersed in
the jaws, roof of the mouth, and tongue (as is
the case with the whole genus, except the gwinniad,
which is toothless, and the grayling,
which has none on the tongue), the back was
dusky, and sides tinged with a purplish bloom,
both above and below the side line, which was
straight, and marked with deep purple spots,
mixed with black. The belly was white; the
first dorsal fin was spotted; the spurious fin
brown, tipped with red; the pectoral, ventral,
and anal fins of a pale brown; the edges of
the latter white; the tail very little forked
when extended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some peculiar remarks upon the various
sorts of trout in the northern counties of England,
and of their growth and age, have been
given by a very experienced angler, to the following
effect:—That he does not undertake
to determine whether the river or burn trout
are of one species: in many points the trout
taken out of the same river and same pools
will agree, and in some shall vary; so that, if
the difference were owing to the water or food,
he could say nothing against their being of one
species: he believes they spawn promiscuously
together, are all similar in shape, in the number
of their fins, and their fins being disposed
in the same places. Whether the colour of
the spots make any specific variety, he leaves
to the decision of naturalists; but, in his opinion,
the so much esteemed char, both red
and white, is only a meer or marsh trout, and
the colour perhaps owing to the sex. In several
of the northern rivers he has taken trouts
as red and as well tasted as any char, and
whose bones, when potted, have dissolved, like
those of the char. That about Michaelmas
he had caught trouts of a coppered hue, without
spots; the flesh when dressed, was like
bees-wax, and well tasted: that likewise in
April he took one of these trout twenty-eight
inches and thick in proportion, which boiled
yellow, but was equally good; and this he
thinks was the bull trout mentioned by Walton,
and several authors, as extraordinary
both for its size and goodness, and to be found
no where but in Northumberland. He records
a still larger fish caught in the same
river (the Cocquet) by him in September, near
Brenkburn Abbey; the length, which was
nearly a yard, did not strike this gentleman so
much, as the bright spots upon the lateral line;
by which it appeared to him to be an overgrown
burn trout, and neither a salmon, salmon-trout,
nor the same with those two he
thought were the bull trout.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walton mentions the Fordwich trout taken
in the river Stour, of which only one instance
was ever known of their being caught by the
angle, and are said to be delicious eating; one
weighing twenty-six pounds, and of a most
beautiful colour, was taken with a net in December
1797; they grow to a larger size.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The burn or river trout, with plenty of
food and good water, grows rapidly; several
experiments were made in ponds fed by river
water, and some by clear springs, into which
the young fry have been put at five or six
months old (that is, in September or October,
reckoning from April, when they first come
from the spawning-beds) at which time they
will be six or seven inches long; in eighteen
months the change has been surprising; he
has seen a pond drained ten months after being
thus stocked, which was in July, when
the fish were fifteen months old; some were
fifteen or sixteen inches, others not more than
eleven or twelve; the fish were returned into
the pond, and it was again drained the March
following, when some were twenty-two inches,
and weighed three pounds; others were sixteen
inches, and some not more than twelve.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In March, or, if mild open weather, in
February, trouts begin to leave their winter
quarters, and approach the shallows and tails
of streams, where they cleanse and restore
themselves to health; as they acquire strength
they advance still higher up the rivers, until
they fix upon their summer residence, for
which they generally choose an eddy, behind
a stone, a log, or bank that projects forward
into the water, and against which the current
drives; whirlpools and holes into which sharps
and shallows fall, under roots of trees, and
in places shaded by boughs and bushes; in
small rivers they frequently lie under sedges
and weeds, especially in the beginning of the
year, before their perfect strength is recovered;
but when in their prime, they feed in
the swiftest streams, and are often found at
the upper end of mill-pools, at locks, flood-gates,
and weirs, also under bridges, or between
two streams running from under their
arches, and likewise in the returns of streams,
where the water seems to boil; in the decline
of summer, they lie at mill-tails, or the
end of other streams, and in the deep water.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Trout spawn, or deposit their ova and seminal
fluid in the end of the autumn or beginning
of winter, from the middle of November
till the beginning of January; their maturity
depending upon the temperature of the
season, their quantity of food, &amp;c. From
some time (a month or six weeks) before
they are prepared for the sexual function, or
that of reproduction, they become less fat,
particularly the females; the large quantity
of eggs and their size, probably affecting the
health of the animal, and compressing generally
the vital organs in the abdomen. They
are at least six weeks or two months after
they have spawned before they recover their
flesh; and the time when these fish are at
the worst is likewise the worst time for fly-fishing,
both on account of the cold weather,
and because there are fewer flies on the water
than at any other season.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It has been remarked by many other people,
as well as myself, that, of all fish in existence,
there is not one that you can partake
of so many days in succession, without ceasing
to enjoy it, as a trout, provided it be fresh
caught, and well in season. Almost every
sportsman, and every fishmonger, has his own
way of fancying that he can tell when a trout
is in season. As to the red spots on the skin
having any thing to do with it, the very idea
is absurd and fallacious. But the more general
criterions are a small head and high
crest, a full tail, and the roof of the mouth,
or, what is still better, the flesh under the
tongue being rather of a pink colour. Another
excellent criterion, which was explained to
me by Mr. Joseph Miller, the fishmonger in
Piccadilly, is the smallness and tightness of
the vent; for the better the trout is in season,
the smaller will be that vent-hole, which
is formed just before the under or belly-fin.
And, after all, I prefer this, and one other
way of deciding; which is by the bright and
silver-like appearance of the scales. Take
twenty trout, and, I think, if you dress them
all, and previously mark that one on which
the scales shone the brightest, it will prove
to be the best fish. This may be frequently
ascertained, even before you land a trout, as
a bright one, on being first hooked, generally
gives two or three leaps out of the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before you send trout on a journey, always
have them cleaned and gutted, and let them
be laid on their backs, and closely packed in
willow (not flag) baskets, and with either
flags or dry wheat-straw. Packing in damp
grass or rushes is apt to ferment, and therefore
liable to spoil your fish.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Salmon and trout were here to be found
among the rest. Indeed the people asserted
there were nine kinds of the former, for all
of which they had names, each kind making
its appearance in the river at different periods
of the year. This must of course be a mistake,
as so many varieties of that fish do not,
I imagine, exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Altogether I caught thirty-seven trout and
salmon, their aggregate weight being two hundred
and twenty-six pounds, or on an average
something better than six pounds a-piece.
The greatest number I killed in any one
day were seven, and the largest I took was
eighteen pounds; this weight was however
comparatively nothing, for in the river below
the falls salmon were occasionally taken in
nets weighing forty, fifty, sixty, and even
seventy pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trout are very fine at Trolhattan; I
have killed them upwards of twelve pounds’
weight. They are about the best grown fish
I ever saw in my life.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The high flavour and red colour for which
the fish taken in Lochleven are so famed, are
understood to arise from the ford by which
they are supported in the loch; it being a
general rule that while the flesh of trout is
white in clear and limpid waters, the same
sort, when found where the rivers pass slowly
through a tract of foul or meadow ground,
have less or more redness in their colour. A
considerable part of the bottom of Lochleven
is spongy, from which aquatic plants rise in
great abundance; and in many parts, towards
the beginning of autumn, cover the surface of
the water with their flowers. But the circumstance
to which the high colour of the
Lochleven trout is chiefly ascribed, is the vast
quantity of a small red shell fish which
abounds in the bottom of the loch, and especially
among the aquatic plants; its form is
globular, and the trouts when caught have
often their stomachs full of these shell-fish.
They generally lie in deep water, and will not
rise to any kind of fly or hook however
baited: it has been remarked also, that in
Lochleven are discovered all the different
species of river trout, and after they have
remained some time in the loch, and approached
towards one pound in weight, they become

<p class='c006'>Of turpentines there are four kinds, viz.
Chio, Strasburg, Venice, and common turpentine;
the two last only are employed in
veterinary medicine. They are effectual diuretics,
and possess a considerable carminative
power. Common turpentine is a principal
ingredient in digestive and detergent ointments.
By distillation we obtain from it the
oil, or, as it is sometimes termed, the spirit of
turpentine, a medicine of great utility. In
doses from two to three or four ounces, it
frequently cures the flatulent colic or gripes;
and, when combined with camphor and other
stimulants, makes a good embrocation for indurated
swellings, strains, and bruises. When
properly mixed with mustard, it forms an embrocation
that has been found serviceable in
counteracting internal inflammation. I have
seen it applied to obstinate ulcers with good
effect. It is a useful ingredient in blistering-ointment
and liniments.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In speaking of the turpentines, Dr. Paris
says they all possess the same chemical as
well as medicinal properties, viz. Canada turpentine,
or Canada balsam, as it is sometimes
improperly called, is obtained from the Pinus
Balsamea. 2dly, Chian or Cyprus turpentine,
from the Pistachia Terebinthinus. 3dly,
Common, or horse turpentine, from the Pinus
Sylvestris, or Scotch fir. 4thly, Venice turpentine
from the Pinus Larix; from the twigs
of this species of fir the essence of spruce is
made. True Riga balsam is made from the
shoots of the Pinus Cembra, previously bruised
and macerated for a month in water. The
same fir also yields Briançon turpentine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Venice turpentine is generally made by
mixing oil with the common turpentine, which
is easily done when the latter is melted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Venice turpentine is sometimes employed
as an ingredient in cough medicines. The
dose is about half an ounce. But if given as
a remedy for flatulent colic, or as a diuretic,
a larger quantity is necessary. It makes a
good detergent ointment, if mixed with about
a fourth or a third part of red precipitate,
finely powdered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Latham considers it a valuable medicine
in epilepsy. As a veterinary medicine
it is certainly of great value; and though in
a few cases, when given internally, it has produced
violent effects, merely, I believe, from
bad management, yet, when judiciously administered,
it may be employed in a dose of
four ounces, with advantage and safety.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have long discontinued the use of oil of
turpentine in my practice as a remedy for
flatulent colic, gripes, or fret; finding the preparations
of opium far more effectual.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The note of the turtle dove is singularly
tender and plaintive; in addressing his mate
the male makes use of a variety of winning
attitudes, cooing at the same time in the most
gentle and soothing accents; on which account
the turtle dove has been represented in all
ages as the most perfect emblem of connubial
attachment and constancy. The turtle arrives
late in the spring, and departs about the latter
end of August; it frequents the thickest and
most sheltered parts of the woods, where it
builds its nest on the highest trees; the female
lays two eggs, and has only one brood in this
country, but in warmer climates it is supposed
to breed several times in the year. Turtles
are pretty common in Kent, where they are
sometimes seen in flocks of twenty or more,
frequenting the pea fields, and are said to do
much damage. Their stay with us seldom
exceeds more than four or five months, during
which time they pair, build their nests, and
rear their young, which are strong enough to
join them in their retreat.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The twitch is a very necessary instrument
in a stable, though, when frequently and unnecessarily
used, it may have the ill effect of
rendering some horses violent and vicious to
resist its future application. In many instances
blindfolding will do more than the twitch;
and some horses may be quieted, when the pain
is not excessive, by holding the ear in one hand,
and rubbing the point of it with the other. A
firm but soothing manner will often engage the
attention and prevent violence; but it is seldom
that either threats or punishment render
an unruly horse better. Inexperienced persons
guard themselves against the hind feet
only, but they should be aware that some
horses strike as truly and as terribly with their
fore feet: it is prudent therefore, in all operations,
to blindfold the animal, and the more so,
as by this he becomes particularly intimidated,
nor will he often strike without an aim. Barnacles
are a sort of clams used by smiths, into
which they introduce the nose in the manner
of a twitch. They are only admissible when
a person is so situated as to be wholly without
assistance.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>As moisture is at all times destructive to

all in his power against its influence on his
rod; for, admitting that a shower of rain
will not spoil it, yet if not protected by
varnish, it may soon be deprived of its elasticity,
which is the chief requisite of any, and
more particularly of a fly-rod. Variety of
methods are used in preparing varnish; the
one here mentioned is said to be excellent.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Varnish Recipe.</i>—Half a pint of linseed
oil, and a little India rubber scraped fine; put
them over a slow fire, and stir them well together,
until the rubber is dissolved, then boil
and skim it, apply it warm, and do not use
the rod until quite dry. The appearance
upon the rod will be like a fine thin bark; it
will preserve the rod from being worm-eaten,
and from other injuries, and is very durable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Another.</i>—Half an ounce of shell, and the
same quantity of seedlac powdered fine in a
mortar; put into separate phials, with half
a pint of good spirits of wine in each, and
placed in a sand heat to dissolve; during the
process, shake the phials often; when each is
dissolved, mix them together in a larger bottle,
with half an ounce of gum benzoin;
increase the heat, and the dregs will subside;
then warm the wood, and with a camel’s hair
brush apply that part of the varnish which is
become fine; the third coat will remain on
the surface, and securely protect the rod from
injury.—<i>Old Receipts.</i></p>

<p>THE VELVET DUCK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The velvet duck is larger than a mallard,
weighing about three pounds two ounces, and
measuring above twenty inches in length.</p>

<p class='c006'>They spread themselves in small numbers
along the shores of Western Europe, as far as
France, where they sometimes appear in company
with the large flocks of scoters, and are
often caught in the fishermen’s nets with those
birds; but they are seldom met with on the
British shores.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The bill broad, with a black knob at the
base; the rest of the bill is yellow; the nail
red; the edges all round black; the plumage
is black, inclining to brown on the belly;
under each eye is a white mark passing backwards
in a streak; across the middle of the
wing is a band of white; legs red; claws
black. The female is more inclining to
brown, and the protuberance on the bill is
wanting; forehead and cheeks under the eye,
dull brownish; behind that a large oval spot
of white; whole upper parts and neck dark
brownish drab; tips of the plumage lighter;
second ones white; wing quills deep brown;
belly brownish-white; tail hoary-brown; the
throat white, marked with dusky specks; legs
and feet yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species much resembles the scoter,
only that bird has no white feathers about it,
and the colour of the bill is somewhat different.
In the windpipe of this bird is a singular
bony swelling, the size of a small walnut,
situated about two-thirds of the length from
the larynx; immediately under the larynx is
another oblong bony cavity, of nearly an inch
in length; at the divarication the parts become
bony, but not greatly enlarged. This
is peculiar to the male sex.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>To destroy vermin.</i>—When dogs are afflicted
with lice, the most effectual remedy is
to rub the whole animal over with train-oil;
allow it to remain on half an hour, and then
wash it off with salt of tartar, or potashes and
water. Soft soap made into a thick paste, and
rubbed over the body, and allowed to remain
on an hour before washing the dog, will effectually
destroy them.</p>

<p class='c006'>N.B.—The method of giving any bolus,
pill, or other medicine to a dog, is to pull out
his tongue, then put it down his throat as far
as possible, and when the dog draws in his
tongue, the medicine will descend into his
stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sopping the skin with tobacco water has
been recommended; but it has only a momentary
effect, and it not unfrequently poisons
the dog. Innumerable other means I have
tried to drive away fleas, but the only tolerably
certain one I have discovered, is to make
dogs sleep on fresh yellow deal shavings.
These shavings may be made so fine as to be
as soft as a feather bed; and, if changed every
week or fortnight, they make the most cleanly
and wholesome one that a dog can rest on;
and the turpentine in them is very obnoxious
to the fleas. But, where it is absolutely impracticable
to employ deal shavings, it will be
found useful to rub or dredge the dog’s hide,
once or twice a week, with very finely powdered
resin: if simply rubbed in, add some
bran.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Vingt-un, or twenty-one, very much resembles
quinze; but may be played by two or
more persons, and as the deal is advantageous,
and often continues long with the same
person, it is usual to determine it at the commencement
by the first ace turned up.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cards must all be dealt out in succession,
unless a natural vingt-un occurs, and
in the mean time the pone, or youngest-hand,
should collect those that have been played,
and shuffle them ready for the dealer against
the period when he shall have distributed the
whole pack. The dealer is first to give two
cards, by one at a time to each player, including
himself, then to ask every person in
rotation, beginning with the eldest hand on
the left, whether he stands or chooses another
card, which, if required, must be given from
off the top of the pack, and afterwards another,
or more, if desired, till the points of the additional
card or cards, added to those dealt,
exceed or make twenty-one exactly, or such
a number less than twenty-one, as may be
judged proper to stand upon; but when the
points exceed twenty-one, then the cards of
that individual player are to be thrown up
directly, and the stake to be paid to the dealer,
who is also in turn entitled to draw additional
cards, and on taking a vingt-un is to receive
double stakes from all who stand the game,
such other players excepted who may likewise
have twenty-one, between whom it is
thereby a drawn game: when any person has
vingt-un, and the dealer not, he who has it
wins double stakes of the dealer; in other
cases, except a natural vingt-un happens, the
dealer pays single stakes to all whose numbers
under twenty-one are higher than his
own, and receives from those who have lower
numbers; but nothing is paid or received by
such players as have similar numbers to the
dealer: and when the dealer draws more than
twenty-one, he is to pay to all who have not
thrown up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Twenty-one, made by an ace and a ten, or
court card, whenever dealt in the first instance,
is styled a natural vingt-un, should be declared
immediately, and entitles the possessor to the
deal, besides double stakes, from all the
players, unless there shall be more than one
natural vingt-un, in which case the younger
hand or hands so having the same, are excused
from paying to the eldest, who takes the deal
of course.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I wrote to you last year on reptiles,
I wish I had not forgot to mention the faculty
that snakes have of stinking <i>se defendendo</i>.
I knew a gentleman who kept a tame snake,
which was in its person as sweet as any animal
while in good humour and unalarmed; but
as soon as a stranger, or a dog or cat, came in,
it fell to hissing, and filled the room with
such nauseous effluvia as rendered it hardly
supportable. Thus the squnck, or stonck, of
Ray’s Synop. Quadr. is an innocuous and
sweet animal; but, when pressed hard by
dogs and men, it can eject such a most pestilent
and fetid smell and excrement, that
nothing can be more horrible.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>On August the 4th, 1775, we surprised
a large viper, which seemed very heavy and
bloated, as it lay in the grass basking in the
sun. When we came to cut it up, we found
that the abdomen was crowded with young,
fifteen in number; the shortest of which measured
full seven inches, and were about the
size of full grown earthworms. This little
fry issued into the world with the true viper
spirit about them, showing great alertness as
soon as disengaged from the belly of the dam:
they twisted and wriggled about, and set themselves
up, and gaped very wide when touched
with a stick, showing manifest tokens of menace
and defiance, though as yet they had no
manner of fangs that we could find, even with
the help of our glasses.</p>

<p class='c006'>To a thinking mind nothing is more wonderful
than that early instinct which impresses
young animals with the notion of the
situation of their natural weapons, and of using
them properly in their own defence, even
before those weapons subsist or are formed.
Thus a young cock will spar at his adversary
before his spurs are grown: and a calf or
lamb will push with its head before its horns
are sprouted. In the same manner did these
young adders attempt to bite before their fangs
were in being. The dam, however, was furnished
with very formidable ones, which we
lifted up (for they fold down when not used)
and cut them off with the point of our scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was little room to suppose that this
brood had ever been in the open air before;
and that they were taken in for refuge, at the
mouth of the dam, when she perceived that
danger was approaching; because then probably
we should have found them somewhere
in the neck, and not in the abdomen.—<i>White’s

<p class='c006'><i>Viscera of the horse.</i>—The alimentary
canal is continued from the expellent orifice
of the stomach to the anus, or end of the
passage; forming a long canal, whose varying
dimensions have occasioned it to be divided
into the small and large intestines. The
length of the tract ranges between twenty-seven
and thirty yards; of which proportions
the small intestines occupy from twenty to
twenty-two yards, and the large from seven to
eight. It is not easy to give a determinate
place to the intestines, either individually or
generally; the large, however, may be said
to occupy all the inferior portion of the abdomen
throughout, and the small to range between
and upon them; both occasionally
shifting their position by the peristaltic motion.
They are, however, prevented from an
unnatural displacement, by membranous productions
of the peritoneum, under the name
of mesentery, mesocolon, and mesorectum.
The first intestinal coat is derived from the
peritoneum, which separates to receive the
tube between its lamen; at once protecting it,
and affording a medium for the transmission
of its vessels and a lubricating surface. The
second, or muscular coat, presents a longitudinal
and a circular plan of fibres; by the
contraction of which, the vermicular motion,
called peristaltic, is performed, the longitudinal
slightly shortening them, and the circular
diminishing their diameter; the inner surface
of this fabric being garnished with a quantity
of dense cellular tissue, was formerly
erroneously considered as another and a nervous
coat. The inner tunic of the intestinal
canal is villous, or mucous, and is very vascular
and sensible, its villi presenting an increased
surface for the mucous secretion, as
well as more numerous chyliferous orifices,
with which it is thickly studded; but it presents
no valvulæ conniventes, as in the human,
their place being supplied by the increased
length of the tract.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Vision of Birds.</i>—Ross, in his voyage to
Baffin’s Bay, proved that a man under favourable
circumstances could see over the surface
of the ocean to the extent of one hundred and
fifty English miles. It is not probable that
any animal exceeds this power of vision, though
birds, perhaps, excel men and most quadrupeds
in sharpness of sight. Schmidt threw at a considerable
distance from a thrush (<i>Turdus musicus</i>)
a few small beetles, of a pale grey-colour,
which the unassisted human eye could not
discover, yet the thrush observed them immediately
and devoured them. The bottle tit
(<i>Parus caudatus</i>,) flits with great quickness
among the branches of trees, and finds on the
very smooth bark its particular food, where
nothing is perceptible to the naked eye, though
insects can be detected there by the microscope.
A very tame red-breast (<i>Sylva rubecula</i>,
<span class='sc'>Latham</span>,) discovered crumbs from the
height of the branch where it usually sat, at
the distance of eighteen feet from the ground
the instant they were thrown down, and this
by bending its head to one side, and using of
course only one eye. At the same distance
a quail discovered, with one eye, some poppy-seeds,
which are very small and inconspicuous.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Vives</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease in horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>This disorder consists of a swelling of the
parotid gland, situated immediately beneath
the ear, and is commonly named the vives
or ives. Fomentations of hot water should
be first applied, that is, a large piece of thick
woollen cloth should be wrung out of hot water,
and kept in contact with the swelling. After
continuing this operation for some time, the
woollen cloth may be confined close to the part,
by suitable bandages, until it is convenient to
repeat the fomentation. Sometimes these
swellings go on to suppuration, and burst; when
this happens, the opening should be enlarged
sufficiently to introduce the fore-finger, and
when the extent of the cavity has been thus
ascertained, any further opening, should it appear
necessary, may be made. A tent of digestive
ointment is then to be applied, and repeated
daily until the disease is cured. Sometimes
these swellings continue hard, and I have
known them prevent a horse from feeding. In
a case of this kind, which I met with last
spring, I completely relieved the horse in a
short time, by rubbing in the following ointment:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The hair must be closely cut off from the
swelling, and the ointment well rubbed in with
the hand for about ten minutes. When horses
have sore necks, and lose the jugular vein,
which sometimes happens after bleeding, a hard
swelling of the parotid gland takes place, which
generally continues a considerable time. In
such cases, the above ointment, after the disease
in the neck has been cured, may be
tried.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ulcer</span>, <i>s.</i> A sore of continuance, not a new wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ulceration is a process directly the reverse
of granulation; for as that builds up, so ulceration
directly breaks down parts, which become
absorbed through the medium of the
lymphatics; the surfaces thus acted on producing
at the same time a purulent or other
discharge. An abraded surface thus circumstanced
is called an ulcer, for the cure of
which we must endeavour to remedy the morbid
action, by exciting a new and more healthy
one; by which the part being then brought
to the condition of a simple wound, will heal.
When ulcers have continued for a long time,
it is often necessary to employ constitutional
remedies to establish a cure. In full habits
we increase the other secretions, as those of
the bowels, the kidneys, the skin, &amp;c., by purgatives,
diuretics, and such remedies as act on
the skin. We also lessen the excess of morbid
secretion of pus, by establishing a new and
artificial drain in the neighbourhood, which is
done by setons or by rowels. In some cases,
instead of existing plethora the ulcer has occasioned,
or is accompanied by great irritability
of system, which must be combatted by opium,
and other sedatives; or if debility become
very apparent, tonics must be given, together
with liberal diet. In general cases, stable
soiling, a course of carrots, or other total
change of food, assists the healing and restorative
process greatly. Ulcers are often found
of a greater extent internally than externally;
and when such cavities extend in different directions,
they form the sinuses of the surgeon
and the pipes of the farrier: when the edges
of the external opening are hardened, it is said
to be fistulous. In general cases, the longer
an ulcer has lasted, the more obstinately will
the vessels have gained a diseased habit, and
the more difficulty there will be to bring them
back to a healthy state. The external means
employed for this purpose are usually three;
stimulating injections, seton, or incision;
which operations it will not be necessary to
enter upon here, as we shall proceed to describe
the more common and important ulcers,
with their treatment, separately. It remains,
however, to state, that ulcers in general are
apt to be treated by farriers erroneously, by
plugging up the sinuses, by which the matter
formed penetrates farther, bringing into its
own action all the neighbouring parts. They
likewise dress them so seldom, that the pus
frequently takes on a process of decomposition,
and becomes acrid; and, lastly, they neglect
to gain a depending orifice for these collections.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Inflammation of the kidneys is generally
caused by riding or driving a horse immoderately,
by straining the loins, in making him
draw heavy loads or carry heavy burthens;
or they may become inflamed in consequence
of peritonæal inflammation of the bowels. In
either case breed freely, or to faintness; cover
the loins with a fresh sheep skin, the flesh
side under, having first rubbed on them some
warm embrocation, such as hartshorn and oil,
with a little oil of turpentine, or the following
embrocation. Open the bowels with a dose
of castor oil and clysters of warm water, with
a small quantity of salt and oil, or hog’s lard.
I should first have noticed, however, the
symptoms of the disorder, which are, a constant
desire to make water, without being able
to void any, or scarcely any: and the little
that is discharged is dark coloured or bloody.
There is great stiffness of the hind parts,
generally more observable in one leg than the
other. The horse often stands straddling or
wide, as if in want to make water, and every
now and then straining, or making painful
and ineffectual efforts to stale. This appearance
often leads the groom to think that it is
a stoppage of water, and that a diuretic is
necessary; but the fact is, that the dark-coloured
or bloody urine is so stimulating or
acrimonious that the bladder contracts violently
in order to force out the smallest quantity
that gets into it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The disorder I have now been describing
may happen in various degrees, but still the
treatment is the same. It sometimes happens,
however, that the urine becomes foul and
stimulating from high feeding, or foul and
unwholesome feeding. In this case the
bladder will contract upon a small quantity
of urine, and the urine may be rather high
coloured, like beer, or turbid, like whey, and
the horse may appear to strain a little in voiding
it; but this is very different from those
distressing symptoms which attend inflammation
of the kidneys, nor is it accompanied
with loss of appetite, or any degree of fever,
which is always present in inflammation of
the kidneys. When the urine becomes thus
stimulating, some cold mashes, with a little
nitre, may be given, or what is still better,
perhaps, some grass, vetches, or lucern. If
the horse is at all costive, a clyster should be
thrown up. An infusion of linseed is a good
drink for a horse when the urine is in this
state.</p>

<p class='c006'>The improper manner in which horses are
generally fed, the early age at which they are
worked, and the immoderate degree in which
they are often worked, are circumstances
which either separately or conjointly tend to
weaken the stomach, and disturb the digestive
functions; in consequence of this the blood
becomes foul, or loaded with excrementitious
matter, the greatest part of which, in the
horse, is carried off by the kidneys. This
renders the urine more acrimonious than it
would otherwise be, and causes the bladder to
contract upon a smaller quantity. We may
often observe, also, how the urinary passages
are stimulated by such urine, making mares
appear as if they were horsing, and causing an
erection in geldings. As the horse is often
staling in this case, and voiding but a small
quantity, and appearing as if he was endeavouring
to void more, it is often mistaken for
a stoppage in the water, as it is termed, and
diuretics are generally given, which, if not too
strong, may be of service. But the best plan
is to keep the horse on bran mashes chiefly
for a few days, and give twice a day, for two
or three days, the following powder:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Or, No. 2, Nitre, powdered resin, chalk,
and levigated antimony, of each two drachms.—Mix
for one dose.</p>

<p class='c006'>If these powders appear to disagree with
the stomach they should be discontinued: in
such cases the cordial diuretic is more likely
to do good, such as has been prescribed for
asthmatic affection or broken wind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Retention of urine, strangury, or stoppage
of water, may be caused by inflammation and
swelling of the neck of the bladder; and this
may be brought on by a peculiar acrimony in
the urine, such as that produced by cantharides
when taken as medicine. The different
species of pepper, or grains of paradise, may
produce some effect of this kind. The neck
of the bladder may be pressed down upon
the pubis by an accumulation of dung in the
rectum, so as to stop the passage completely.
A clyster is always proper on these occasions,
for if an accumulation of dung be the cause,
it will be speedily removed. But there will
be some difficulty in giving the clyster, unless
some of the hard dung is first taken out with
the hand. The neck of the bladder may be
so affected with spasm as to confine the urine.
This may be the cause of the stoppage of
water that happens in flatulent colic, but I
rather think it depends entirely upon an accumulation
of dung in the bowels, therefore I
always prescribe a clyster in colic, of whatever
kind it may be.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p>WATER CRAKE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This bird weighs about four ounces, and
measures nearly nine inches in length, and
about fifteen in breadth. The bill is of a
greenish-yellow, and not more than three quarters
of an inch long. The top of the head,
to the nape, is dusky, and slightly streaked
with rusty-brown; a brown and white mottled
stripe passes from the bill over and behind
the eyes; the cheeks and throat are of a
freckled dull grey. The neck and breast are
olive, marked with small white spots; the
sides dusky and olive, crossed with bars of
white, and the under parts are a mixture of
cinereous, dirty and white yellow. The colour
of the plumage of all the upper parts is
dusky and olive-brown, spotted, edged, barred
or streaked with white; the spots on the
wing-coverts are surrounded with black, which
gives them a studded or pearly appearance;
and the white bars and streaks on the scapulars
and tertials form a beautiful contrast to
the black ground of the feathers on these
parts. The legs are of a yellowish-green.
The water-crake in its figure and general appearance,
though much less, is extremely
like the corn-crake or land-rail; but its manners
and habits are very different. Its common
abode is in low, swampy grounds, in
which are pools or streamlets, overgrown with
willows, reeds, and rushes, where it lurks and
hides itself with great circumspection; it is
wild, solitary, and shy, and will swim, dive,
or skulk under any cover; and sometimes it
is said, will suffer itself to be knocked on the
head, rather than rise before the sportsman
and his dog. This species is very scarce in
Great Britain, and from its extreme vigilance
it is rarely to be seen. It is supposed to be
migratory here, as well as in France and Italy,
where it is found early in the spring; it is
also met with in other parts of Europe, but no
where in great numbers. The conformation
of its nest is curious; it is made of rushes and
other light, buoyant materials, woven and matted
together, so as to float on, and to rise or
fall with the ebbing or flowing of the water,
like a boat; and to prevent its being swept
away by floods, it is moored or fastened to the
pendent stalk of one of the reeds, by which it
is screened from the sight, and sheltered from
the weather. The female lays from six to
eight eggs. The young brood do not long
require the fostering care of the mother, but
as soon as they are hatched, the whole of the
little black shapeless family scramble away
from her, take to the water, separate from
each other, and shift for themselves. The
flesh is said to have a fine and delicate flavour,
and is esteemed by epicures a delicious morsel.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>It is an error to suppose this the same as
the cad bait, for though generally found by
the water side, the latter is always in some
kind of husk, the creeper never, nor has ever
wings, and cannot therefore be the stone-fly;
it may be kept in the same way as the cadis.</p>

<p class='c006'>They may be kept in a large horn, like that
for powder, with gravel at the bottom, and
some holes at the sides to admit air: the
mouth of the horn should be wide enough to
receive a quart bottle cork, and should be
placed in water with the creepers, when not
using them.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_569.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>The Great Rough Water Dog.</i> (<i>Canis
Aquaticus</i>, <span class='sc'>Linn.</span>)—The great rough water
dog has long curly hair, is web-footed, swims
with great ease, and is extremely useful in
the sport of shooting aquatic birds. He has
many of the qualities of the land spaniel.</p>

<p class='c006'>This dog has a great liking to fetching and
carrying, and such is his exquisite sense of
smell, that he will find a particular stone
thrown by his master to the bottom of a river:
he dives with astonishing dexterity. He is
particularly valuable on board of ships, as he
leaps from the side of a vessel after any article
which has fallen overboard, and is very useful
for recovering birds that have been shot from
the deck of the ship. Above all, he is lively,
playful, good-tempered, and much attached to
his master.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Large Water Spaniel.</i> (<i>Canis Inquisitor.</i>)—The
large water spaniel is about the
size of an ordinary setter, but much stronger
in the bone and shorter in the legs. His
head is long, his muzzle moderately acute,
and his face is quite smooth, as well as the
front of all his legs; his ears are long, which,
together with his whole body, is covered with
deep hair, consisting of firm, small, and distinctly
crisped curls, not unlike those of a wig,
his tail is rather short, and clothed with curled
hair. His hair is very differently curled from
the great water dog and poodle, as that of the
two latter consists of long and pendulous curls.
His general colour is a dark liver-brown, with
white legs, neck, and belly; and is sometimes,
though rarely to be met with, all black, or
with a black body and white neck and legs.</p>

<p class='c006'>His smell is extremely acute, and he has
in some instances been taught to set, but this
is rather a difficult task, from his naturally
lively disposition. He takes the water with
great eagerness, on which account he is a valuable
dog in shooting wild fowl; he watches
with much keenness and anxiety the motions
of his master, and as soon as the bird is killed
he instantly plunges into the water, fetches it
out, and lays it at the feet of his master. He
is very quick at finding the haunts of wild
fowl; he is also easily taught to fetch and
carry articles, and will seek things which have
been lost, on which account he has received
in England the appellation of the finder.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great water spaniel has sometimes been
employed in otter hunting, but it is seldom he
has the pluck to combat with so keen an adversary.
He is an animal naturally distinguished
for mildness and docility, qualities
which are pourtrayed in his countenance, and
is remarkable for his attachment to his master.</p>

<p class='c006'>The native country of this dog is Spain;
but we conceive that the variety we possess,
which is a very distinct one, is not the pure
breed as originally imported into this country,
but that it is the produce of the large water
dog and the English setter, as it appears to be
intermediate between these, not only in figure,
but also in their united qualities.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The Small Water Spaniel, or Poodle.</i>
(<i>Canis Aquaticus minor.</i>)—This variety is
presumed to be the offspring of the large
water dog and the small cocker; it has all the
appearance of the former, not only in shape,
but also in the thick curled silky hairs. It is
a most lively active dog, with an acute sense of
smell, and is very susceptible of instruction of
almost every kind. Its general colour is white,
although individuals are sometimes found
with black patches over various parts of their
bodies. The poodle is very fond of diving,
and can find at the bottom of a river or pond
any particular stone thrown in by his master.</p>

<p class='c006'>In France this dog is a great favourite, and
is taught many curious tricks. He is an excellent
companion in shooting of wild fowl, which,
when killed in the water, he very soon recovers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some dogs are more easily instructed than
others, though all are sufficiently docile. The
poodle breed is the most extraordinary for aptitude
in this particular; many have been
made so useful as to perform the common offices
of a servant, such as to go on ordinary
errands, shut and open doors, ring bells, &amp;c.
and their knack at mimicry is extreme.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>I have tried poodles, but always found them
inferior in strength, scent, and courage. They
are also very apt to be sea-sick. The Portland
dogs are superior to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>A water-dog should not be allowed to jump
out of a boat, unless ordered so to do, as it is
not always required, and therefore needless
that he should wet himself and every thing
about him without necessity.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a punt or canoe, always make choice of
the smallest Newfoundland dog that you can
procure; as the smaller he is the less water he
brings into your boat after being sent out; the
less cumbersome he is when afloat; and the
quicker he can pursue crippled birds upon the
mud. A bitch is always to be preferred to a
dog in frosty weather, from being, by nature,
less obstructed in landing on the ice.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, on the other hand, you want a Newfoundland
dog only as a retriever for covert shooting,
then the case becomes different; as here you
require a strong animal, that will easily trot
through the young wood and high grass with a
large hare or pheasant in his mouth.—<i>Brown</i>—<i>Hawker.</i></p>

<img src='images/i_570.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this bird varies from ten and
a half to fifteen ounces; the length from the tip
of the beak to the end of the tail is about fourteen
inches, the breadth twenty-two; the bill
is rather more than an inch long, of a greenish
yellow at the tip, and reddish towards the base,
whence a singular kind of horny or membranous
substance shields the forehead as far as
the eyes; this appendage to the bill is as red
as sealing-wax in the breeding season; at other
times it varies or fades into a white colour.
The head is small and black, except a white
spot under each eye, the irides which are red;
all the upper part of the plumage is of a dark
shining olive green, inclining to brown; the
under parts are of a dark hoary lead colour;
vent feathers black; those on the belly and
thighs tipped with dirty white; long loose feathers
on the sides, which hang over the upper
part of the thighs, are black, streaked with
white; the ridge of the wing, outside feathers
of the tail, and those underneath, are white;
the upper bare part of the thighs is red; from
the knees to the toes, the colours are different
shades, from pale yellow to deep green; the
toes are very long, the middle one measuring
to the end of the nail, nearly three inches;
their undersides are broad, being furnished with
membranous edgings their whole length on
each side, which enable the bird to swim, and
easily run over the surface of the slimy mud
by the sides of the waters where it frequents.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes her nest of a large quantity
of withered reeds and rushes, closely interwoven,
and is particularly careful to have it
placed in a most retired spot, close by the brink
of the waters, and it is said, she never quits it
without covering her eggs with the leaves of
the surrounding herbage. Pennant and Latham
say, she builds her nest upon some low
stump of a tree, or shrub, by the water side;
no doubt she may sometimes vary the place of
her nest, according as particular circumstances
may command, but she generally prefers the
other mode of building it. She lays six or
seven eggs at a time, and commonly has two
hatchings in a season. The eggs are nearly
two inches in length, and are irregularly and
thinly marked with rust-coloured spots on a
yellowish white ground. The young brood
remain but a short time in the nest, under the
nurturing care of the mother, but as soon as
they are able to crawl out they take to the
water, and shift for themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the water-hen is nowhere very
numerous, yet one species or other of them is
met with in almost every country in the known
world. It is not yet ascertained whether they
ever migrate from this to other countries, but
it is well known that they make partial flittings
from one district to another, and are
found in the cold mountainous tracts in summer,
and in lower and warmer situations in
winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>On examination of several specimens of this
bird, in full feather, they were found, like most
birds of plain plumage, very little different
from each other.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_571.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The length of the water ousel is about seven
inches and a half from the point of the beak
to the end of its tail, which is very short, and
gives the bird a thick and stumpy appearance.
The mouth is wide; the bill black, about three
quarters of an inch long; the upper mandible
rather hollow in the middle and bent a little
downwards at the point; the eyelids are white,
and irides hazel. The upper parts of the head
and of the neck are of a deepish rusty-brown;
the back, rump, scapulars, wing coverts, belly,
vent, and tail are black; but each feather on
these parts is distinctly edged with a hoary
grey colour. The breast, forepart of the neck,
and throat, are of a snowy white; and the black
and white on the belly and breast are separated
by a rusty brown. The legs and toes
are short and strong, the scales pale blue, the
hinder part and joints brown; the claws are
curved, and the toes are distinctly parted
without any membranous substance between
to join them.</p>

<p class='c006'>This solitary species is removed from the
place it has hitherto holden in all systems
among the land birds: it ought not to be
classed any longer with the ousels and thrushes,
to which it bears no affinity. Its manners and
habits are also different from those birds, and
are peculiar to itself. It is chiefly found in
the high and mountainous parts of the country,
and always by the sides of brooks and rocky
rivers, but particularly where they fall in cascades,
or run with great rapidity among stones
and fragments of broken rocks; there it may
be seen perched on the top of a stone in the
midst of the torrent, in a continual dipping
motion, or short courtesy often repeated, whilst
it is watching for its food, which consists of
small fishes and insects. The feathers of this
bird, like those of the duck tribe, are impervious
to water, whereby it is enabled to continue
a long time in that fluid without sustaining
the least injury. But the most singular
trait in its character, (and it is well authenticated)
is that of its possessing the power of
walking, in quest of its prey, on the pebbly
bottom of a river, in the same way, and with
the same ease, as if it were on dry land. The
female makes her nest in the banks of the rivulet,
of the same kind of material, and nearly
of the same form as that of the common wren;
and lays four or five eggs, which are white,
lightly blushed with red.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>This bird, though a distinct genus of itself,
has many traits in its character very similar to
both the corn crake and the water crake; it
is migratory, like the former, to which it also
bears some resemblance in its size, its long
shape, and in the flatness of its body: its
haunts and manner of living are nearly the
same as those of the latter; but it differs from
both in the length of its bill, and its plumage.
It weighs about four ounces and a half, and
measures twelve inches in length and sixteen
in breadth. The bill is slightly curved, and
one inch and three quarters long: the upper
mandible is dusky, edged with red; the under
reddish orange; the irides red. The top of
the head, hinder part of the neck, back, scapulars,
coverts of the wings and tail are black;
edged with dingy brown. The ridge of the
wings is white, the bastard wing barred with
white, the inside barred with brown and white,
and the quills and secondaries dusky. The
side feathers are beautifully crossed with
black and white, and slightly tipped with pale
reddish brown. The inner side of the thighs,
the belly, and the vent are pale brown, and
in some specimens specked with bluish ash.
The sides of the head, chin, forepart of the
neck, and breast, are of a dark hoary lead
colour, slightly tinged with pale rufous. The
tail consists of twelve short black feathers,
edged and tipped with dirty red; some of
those on the under side barred with black
and white. The legs which are placed far
behind, are a dull dirty red; the toes long
and without any connecting membrane. Latham
says, “the eggs are more than an inch
and a half long, of a pale yellowish colour,
marked all over with dusky brown spots,
nearly equal in size, but irregular.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The water rail is a shy and solitary bird.
Its constant abode is in low wet places, much
overgrown with sedges, reeds, and other coarse
herbage, among which it finds shelter, and
feeds in hidden security. It runs, occasionally
flirting up its tail, through its tracks, with the
same swiftness as the corn crake runs through
the meadows and cornfields, shows as great
an aversion to take flight as that bird, and
has more of the means in its power of disappointing
the sportsman. It generally exhausts
his patience, and distracts and misleads
his dog, by the length of time to which it can
protract its taking wing: and it seldom rises
until it has crossed every pool, and ran
through every avenue within the circuit of its
retreats. It is, however, easily shot when
once flushed, for it flies but indifferently, with
its legs dangling down while on the wing.
This bird is not very common in Great Britain,
but is said to be numerous in the marshes
of the northern countries of Europe, whence,
partially and irregularly, it migrates southward,
even into Africa, during the severity of
the winter season. Buffon says, “they pass
Malta in the spring and autumn,” and to confirm
this, adds, “that the Viscount de Querhoent
saw a flight of them at the distance of
fifty leagues from the coasts of Portugal, on
the 17th of April, some of which were so
fatigued that they suffered themselves to be
caught by the hand.” The flesh of the water
rail is not so generally esteemed as that of
the land rail, and yet by many it is thought
rich and delicious eating.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

(<i>Arvicola aquatica</i>, <span class='sc'>Fleming</span>,) again, which
is the one alluded to by White, swims as
readily below as above water, and feeds chiefly
on the roots of water plants. White was near
the truth in supposing two species of water
rats, inasmuch as he was not acquainted with
the water shrew (<i>Sorex ciliatus</i>, <span class='sc'>Sowerby</span>),
so well described by Mr. Dovaston of Shrewsbury
in the Magazine of Natural History.
“I repeatedly,” he says, “marked it glide
from the bank under water, and bury itself
under the mass of leaves at the bottom. It
very shortly returned and entered the bank,
occasionally putting its long sharp nose out of
the water and paddling close to the edge.
This it repeated at very frequent intervals,
from place to place, seldom going more than
two yards from the side, and always returning
in about half a minute. I presume it sought
and obtained some insect or food among the
rubbish and leaves, and retired to consume it.
Sometimes it would run a little on the surface,
and sometimes timidly and hastily come
on shore, but with the greatest caution, and
instantly plunge in again. When under water
he looks gray, on account of the pearly cluster
of minute air bubbles that adhere to his
fur and bespangle him all over. He only
appears at evening, and such is his general
habit. Once, however, at broad and bright
noon, while leaning on a tree gazing on the
sun sparkles, like fairy lights, in numberless
and eternal succession under the gentlest
breath of air, I was aware of my little friend
running nimbly on the surface among them.
My rapture caused me to start with delight,
on which he vanished to security within his
rush-fringed bank.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>During summer they reside principally in
holes on the banks of rivers, ditches, and
ponds; but, as winter comes on, they approach
the human habitations, and very often
take up their abode in barns, corn-stacks, &amp;c.
They have haunts or runs in the walls and
under the floors of old houses, where they
frequently injure the furniture; and they
have been known to gnaw the extremities of
infants while asleep. They swim with ease,
and will dive after fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rats increase very fast; they will bring
forth three times a year, and produce from ten
to fifteen at a birth. They are numerous in
most large towns; and though they seek the
fields on the approach of summer, it generally
arises from a diminution of food about farm-houses,
&amp;c., as well as from the insecurity
which they feel from the removal of the
corn-stacks, the clearing of the barns, &amp;c., at
the same time that plenty of food is presented
abroad in the fields. When a colony
of these animals happens to take possession of
a field of standing corn, they make dreadful
havoc.</p>

<p class='c006'>These animals will attack young poultry,
and even the old, if pressed by hunger;
and their voracity is such that they have been
known to fasten on the fatter parts of living
swine; nor are infants in their cradle always
free from their attacks. They will destroy
young game, and indeed the rat may be regarded
as a general marauder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rats become uncommonly bold from impunity,
but they are easily destroyed or driven
away when proper means for that purpose
are adopted. There are various methods of
taking or destroying these creatures, the most
effective of which will be detailed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weasel tribe pursue the rat as fiercely
as the hare; but the rat, unlike “the poor
timid hare,” does not resign itself to its fate;
it is interesting to see the small weasel attack
a large rat. The latter will get away, if possible;
but finding escape out of the question,
it turns upon its invincible assailant and fights
while it is able, crying out all the time. From
the active motions of the rat in this contest,
as well as from its evident superiority in
strength, a spectator might suppose that the
business must end in the defeat or destruction
of the weasel; but, after a time, the
efforts of the rat evidently grow languid,
while the weasel may be perceived sticking
like a leech, its teeth fast hold of the rat
about the head or neck. The battle lasts no
great length of time; for when once the weasel
has got hold, all the efforts of the rat are
not sufficient to dislodge it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ferret, it is well known, is in general
use for the destruction of rats, assisted by the
terrier; and this was a kind of business or
employment followed by numbers throughout
the country.—<i>White’s Selborne</i>—<i>Gamekeeper’s

<p class='c006'>In this country, one hundred pounds of

or six pounds of wax; in some of the southern
countries nearly double that quantity. Transparent
white honey is to be preferred to the
higher coloured; new to old, and that of the
spring to the summer or autumnal honey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wax being crumbled or pressed, must
be boiled in water, and then strained from bags
into a tub of water. The water being strained
when the wax is cold, it may be collected,
boiled, and when cool, will be found in a cake
on the surface. It is refined by repeated

<p class='c006'>The hare has no enemy more fatal than the
weasel, which will follow and terrify it into a
state of absolute imbecility, when it gives itself
up without resistance, at the same time making
piteous outcries. The weasel seizes its
prey near the head: the bite is mortal, although
the wound is so small that the entrance
of the teeth is scarcely perceptible; a hare or
rabbit bit in this manner is never known to
recover, but lingers for some time and dies.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common weasel is the least animal of
this species; the disproportionate length and
height of the little animals which compose
this class are their chief characteristics, and
are alone sufficient to distinguish them from
all other carnivorous quadrupeds; the length
of the wolf, in proportion to its height, is as
one and a half to one; that of the weasel is
nearly as four to one. The weasel never exceeds
seven inches in length from the nose to
the tail, which is only two inches and a half
long, ends in a point, and adds considerably to
the apparent length of the body; the height
of the weasel is not above two inches and a
half, so that it is almost four times as long as
it is high; the most prevailing colour is a pale
tawny brown, resembling cinnamon, on the
back, sides, and legs; the throat and belly
white; beneath the corners of the mouth on
each jaw is a spot of brown; the eyes are
small, round, and black; the ears broad and
large, and from a fold at the lower part have
the appearance of being doubled; it has likewise
whiskers like a cat, but has two more
teeth than any of the cat kind, having thirty-two
in number, and these well adapted for
tearing and chewing its food. The motion of
the weasel consists of unequal bounds or leaps,
and in climbing a tree it gains a height of
some feet from the ground by a single spring;
in the same precipitate manner it jumps upon
its prey, and possessing great flexibility of
body, easily evades the attempts of much
stronger animals to seize it. We are told that
an eagle, having pounced upon a weasel,
mounted into the air with it, and was soon
after observed to be in great distress; the
little animal had extricated itself so much
from the eagle’s hold as to be able to fasten
upon the throat, which presently brought the
eagle to the ground, and gave the weasel an
opportunity of escaping. Its activity is remarkable,
and it will run up the sides of a
wall with such facility that no place is secure
from it. The weasel also preys in silence,
and never utters any cry except when it is
struck, when it expresses resentment or pain
by a rough kind of squeaking. It is useful
to the farmer in winter by clearing his barns
and granaries of rats and mice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weasel sleeps in its hole during the
greater part of the day, and evening is the
chief time when it begins its depredations;
it may then be seen stealing from its retreat,
and creeping about in search of prey, which
extends to all the eggs it can meet with, and
it not unfrequently destroys the bird that
tries to defend them. If it enter the henroost
the chickens are sure to fall victims; it
does not there often attack the cocks or old
hens, nor does it devour what it kills on the
spot, but drags it off to eat at leisure.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ferocity of Weasels.</i>—In the month of
December, 1817, in the parish of Glencairn,
a labourer was suddenly attacked by six weasels,
which rushed upon him from an old dyke,
in the field where he was at work. The man
alarmed at such a furious onset from an unprovoked
enemy, instantly betook himself to
flight, in which, however, he was closely pursued,
and although he had about him a large
horsewhip, with which he endeavoured by
several back hand strokes to stop them, yet
so eager was their pursuit, that he was on the
point of being seized by the throat, when he
luckily noticed at some distance, the fallen
branch of a tree which he made for, and
hastily snatching it up, commenced in turn
the attack with so much success, that he
killed three of them, and put the remaining
three to flight. The man’s life was in great
danger, when it is ascertained that two weasels
are a match for a dog.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Effect of Weather in water shooting.</i>—Fog,
snow, or any other hazy weather, is very
bad, as it makes every thing on the water appear
large and black, and then it is that these
birds (and indeed all others) soon take alarm.
The novice fancies just the reverse. Fog in
the fens and marshes, however, is sometimes
the best weather, although quite the reverse
on the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bright starlight is the very best of all times
for getting at birds, as the tide flows over the
mud; particularly if there is a little breeze,
without wind enough to blacken the shallow
water. If a cold black frost, so much the
better.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even in moonlight wigeons are easier approached
than in hazy weather. In white
frosts wigeons are often restless. In rain they
are constantly flying and pitching. In very
dark weather they are suspicious, and more
on the watch than in starlight; but, if the
wind blows fresh enough to drown the noise
of a launching punt, some “heavy shots” may
now and then be made by sweeping the surface
of the mud to the sound where the flock
is walking and feeding. This may sometimes
be within thirty yards of the “launcher.”
In mild weather, wigeons are generally scattered
about like rooks, till after midnight,
unless they become concentrated by the flow
of the surrounding tide. But in cold weather
they sit thick together.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Weight for Inches.</i>—It may prove a
matter of intelligence to those persons unconnected
with the movements and terms of the
sporting world, to understand that the graduated
scale for a match, when made for
two or more horses to run and carry weight
for inches, is thus: that horses measuring
fourteen hands high are to carry nine stone,
above or below which height they are to
carry seven pounds more or less, for every
inch they are higher or lower than the fourteen
hands fixed as the criterion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Example.</i>—A horse measuring fourteen
hands, one inch and a half, (four inches making
one hand) will carry nine stone, ten pounds,
eight ounces; a horse measuring thirteen
hands, two inches and a half, will carry only
eight stone, three pounds, eight ounces; the
former being one inch and a half above the
fourteen hands, the other one inch and a half
below it; the weight is therefore added or diminished
by the height of every inch higher
or lower.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever might have been the original intention
of cocktail racing (and I have no doubt
it was very laudable) it has become a regular
and well-organised system of swindling and
fraud. It behoves every gentleman and man
of honour connected with the turf to discountenance
it; and if stakes “for horses not
thorough-bred” cannot be immediately expunged
from every race list, a salutary check
may easily be put upon it by weighting the
winners in such a manner as could not fail to
bring them to the proper level. Weight
must and will always tell; and by this means
an effectual bridle would be placed upon these
nefarious cocktails at the commencement of
their career. Even in regard to the age of
these suspicious cocktails, that is often rendered
a doubtful circumstance, as all the
trickery and cunning of the men who own
them are put in practice to accomplish their
purpose in this respect. From information
which I have no reason to doubt, a cocktail
from the north, which has repeatedly won
during the present season (1829) has been
running as a year younger than the correct
age; add to this also, little doubt can exist of
the animal being as thorough-bred as any racer
in the kingdom. Moreover, to say nothing
of the immediate and obvious turpitude of the
system of cocktail racing, it is productive of
continual and never-ending disputes.—<i>Turf

all, for being remarkably surefooted on the
most difficult roads, which renders them extremely
valuable in the mountainous tracts to
which they originally belong. In point of
size and hardiness, they bear a near resemblance
to the best of the native breed of the
Highlands of Scotland, and other hilly countries
in the north of Europe. These animals

<p class='c006'>The whimbrel is only about half the size
of the curlew, which it very nearly resembles
in shape, the colours of its plumage, and manner
of living. It is about seventeen inches in
length, and twenty-nine in breadth, and weighs
about fourteen ounces. The bill is about
three inches long, the upper mandible black,
the under one pale red. The upper part of
the head is black, divided in the middle of the
crown by a white line from the brow to the
hinder part; between the bill and the eyes
there is a darkish oblong spot; the sides of
the head, neck, and breast, are of a pale brown,
marked with narrow dark streaks pointing
downwards; the belly is of the same colour,
but the dark streaks upon it are larger: about
the vent it is quite white; the lower part of
the back is also white. The rump and tail
feathers are barred with black and white; the
shafts of the quills are white, the outer webs
totally black, but the inner ones marked with
large white spots; the secondary quills are
spotted in the same manner on both the inner
and outer webs. The legs and feet are of the
same shape and colour as those of the curlew.</p>

<p class='c006'>You that know so well how necessary it is
for a pack of fox-hounds to be steady, and to
be kept together, ought not to wonder that I
should prefer an excellent whipper-in to an
excellent huntsman. No one knows better
than you do how essential a good adjutant is
to a regiment; believe me, a good whipper-in
is not less so to a pack of fox-hounds. But
I must beg you to observe that I only mean,
that I could do better with mediocrity in the
one than in the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>You say you agree with me, that a huntsman
should stick close to his hounds. If then
his place is fixed, and that of the first whipper-in
(where you have two) is not, I cannot
but think genius may be at least as useful in
one as in the other: for instance, while the
huntsman is riding to his head hounds, the
whipper-in, if he has genius, may show it in
various ways; he may clap forward to any
great earth, that may by chance be open; he
may sink the wind to halloo, or mob the fox,
when the scent fails; he may keep him off his
foil; he may stop the tail hounds, and get
them forward; and has it frequently in his
power to assist the hounds without doing them
any hurt, provided he has sense to distinguish
where he is wanted most. Besides, the most
essential part of fox-hunting, the making and
keeping the pack steady, depends entirely upon
him; as a huntsman should seldom rate, and
never flog a hound. In short, I consider the
first whipper-in as a second huntsman; and
to be perfect, he should be as capable of hunting
the hounds as the huntsman himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>You cannot too much recommend to your
whipper-in to get to the head of his hounds
before he attempts to stop them. The rating
behind is to little purpose, and if they are in
cover, may prevent him from knowing who
the culprits are. When your hounds are running
a fox, he then should content himself
with stopping such as are riotous, and getting
them forward. They may be condemned
upon the spot, but the punishment should be
deferred till the next day, when they may be
taken out on purpose to commit the fault and
suffer the punishment. I agree with you that
young hounds cannot be awed too much; yet
suffer not your punishment of them to exceed
their offence. I could wish to draw a line
betwixt justice and barbarity.</p>

<p class='c006'>A whipper-in, while breaking in young
hounds, sometimes will rate them before they
commit the fault: this prevents them for that
time, but they will be just as ready to begin
the next opportunity. Had he not better let
them quite alone, till he sees what they would
be at? The discipline then may be proportioned
to the degree of the offence. Whether
a riotous young hound runs little or much is
of small consequence, if he be not encouraged;
it is the blood only that signifies, which in
every kind of riot should carefully be prevented.</p>

<p class='c006'>My general orders to my whipper-in are, if
when he rates a hound, the hound does not
mind him, to take him up immediately, and
give him a severe flogging. Whippers-in are
too apt to continue rating, even when they
find that rating does not avail. There is but
one way to stop such hounds, which is to get
to the heads of them. I also tell him never
on any account to strike a hound, unless the
hound is at the same time sensible what it is
for; never to strike a hound that does not
deserve it, and to strike those hard that do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such of my hounds as are very riotous are
taken out by themselves on the days when
they do not hunt, and properly punished; and
this is continued while my patience lasts,
which of course depends on the value of the
dog. It is a trial betwixt the whipper-in and
the dog, which will tire first; and the whipper-in,
I think, generally prevails. If this
method will not make them steady, no other
can: they are then looked upon as incorrigible,
and are put away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such hounds as are notorious offenders
should also feel the lash, and hear a rate, as
they go to the cover; it may be a useful hint
to them, and may prevent a severer flogging
afterwards. A sensible whipper-in will wait
his opportunity to single out his hound; he
will then hit him hard, and rate him well;
whilst a foolish one will often hit a dog he did
not intend to hit; will ride full gallop into
the midst of the hounds; will perhaps ride
over some of the best of them, and put the
whole pack into confusion. This is a manœuvre
I cannot bear to see.</p>

<p class='c006'>Have a care! are words which seldom do
any harm; since hounds, when they are on a
right scent, will not mind them. Let your
whipper-in be careful how he encourages the
hounds: that, improperly done, may spoil
your pack.</p>

<p class='c006'>A whipper-in will rate a hound, and then
endeavour to flog him. A dog, after having
been rated, will naturally avoid the whip.
Tell your whipper-in, whenever a hound deserves
the lash, to hit him first, and rate him
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>When there are two whippers-in, one ought
always to be forward. When there is only
one, he, to be very perfect, should be a very
Mungo, here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p class='c006'>You will find it difficult to keep your people
in their proper places. I have been
obliged to stop back myself to bring on hounds
which my servant had left behind. I cannot
give you a greater proof how necessary it is
that a whipper-in should bring home all his
hounds, than by telling you that I have lost
an old hound for ten days, and sent all the
country over to inquire after him; and at
last, when I thought no more about him, in
drawing a large cover in the country where he
had been lost, he joined the pack: he was
exceedingly emaciated, and it was a long
time before he recovered. How he subsisted
all that time I cannot imagine. When any
of your hounds are missing, you should send
the whipper-in back immediately to look for
them: it will teach him to keep them more
together.</p>

<p class='c006'>The getting forward the tail hounds is a
necessary part of fox-hunting, in which you
will find a good whipper-in of the greatest
use. He must also get forward himself at
times, when the huntsman is not with the
hounds; but the second whipper-in (who
frequently is a young lad, ignorant of his
business) on no account ought to encourage
or rate a hound, but when he is quite certain
it is right to do it; nor is he ever to get
forward, as long as a single hound remains
behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Halloo forward is certainly a necessary and
a good halloo; but is it not used too indiscriminately?—it
is for ever in the mouth of a
whipper-in. If your hounds are never used
to that halloo till after a fox is found, you
will see them fly to it. At other times other
halloos will answer the purpose of getting
them on as well.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most huntsmen, I believe, are jealous of
the whipper-in: they frequently look on him
as a successor, and therefore do not very
readily admit him into the kennel; yet, in
my opinion, it is necessary he should go there;
for he ought to be well acquainted with the

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Whist</span>, <i>s.</i> A game at cards, requiring close attention and silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>This game, which requires great care and
attention, is played by four persons, who cut
for partners; those who cut the two highest
cards are partners against the two lowest, and
the person who cuts the lowest card is entitled
to the deal. In cutting, the ace is accounted
the lowest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though it is customary for only the elder
hand, and afterwards the dealer, to shuffle the
cards, yet each player has a right so to do before
the deal, but the elder hand ought to
shuffle last, except the dealer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pack is afterwards cut by the right-hand
adversary, and the dealer is to distribute
the cards, alternately, one at a time, to each
of the players, beginning with the left-hand
adversary, till the last card, which must be
turned up, being the trump, and left on the
table till the first trick is played.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one, before his partner plays, should
intimate, that he has or has not won the
trick; even the attempt to take up a trick,
though won before the last partner has played,
is deemed very improper. No intimations of
any kind during the play of the cards between
partners are to be admitted. The mistake
of one party is the game of the adversary.
However, there is one exception to this rule,
in case of a revoke: if a person happen not
to follow suit, or to trump a suit, the partner
is permitted to inquire, whether he is sure he
has none of that suit in his hand. This indulgence
must have arisen from the severe
penalties annexed to revoking, which affect
the parties equally.</p>

<p class='c006'>The person on the dealer’s left-hand is
called the elder hand, and plays first; and
whoever wins the trick becomes the elder
hand, and plays again; and so on till all the
cards are played out. The tricks belonging
to each party should be turned and collected
by the respective partners of whoever wins
the first trick in that hand. Each trick above
six is reckoned one point towards the game.
The ace, king, queen, and knave of trumps,
are called honours; and when either of the
parties has in his own hand, or between himself
and his partner, three honours, they
count two points towards the game; and if
they should have the four honours, they
count four points. Ten points make the
game.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is nearly of the same size as the gadwall,
weighing generally about twenty-three
ounces, and measuring nearly twenty inches
in length, and two feet three in breadth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bill is an inch and a half long, narrow,
and serrated on the inner edges; the upper
mandible is of a dark lead-colour, tipped with
black. The crown of the head, which is very
high and narrow, is of a cream-colour, with a
small spot of the same under each eye; the
rest of the head, the neck, and the breast, are
bright rufous chestnut, obscurely freckled on
the head with black spots, and darkest on the
chin and throat, which are tinged with a
vinous colour; a band, composed of beautifully
waved, or indented narrow ash-brown
and white lines, separates the breast and neck;
the back and scapulars are marked with similar
feathers, as are also the sides of the body
under the wings, even as low as the thighs,
but there they are paler; the belly to the
vent is white; the ridge of the wing, and adjoining
coverts, are dusky ash-brown; the
greater coverts brown, edged with white, (in
some specimens wholly white,) and tipped with
black, which forms an upper border to the
changeable green beauty-spots of the wings,
which is also bordered on the under side by
another stripe formed by the deep velvet
black tips of the secondary quills; the exterior
webs of the adjoining quills are white,
and those next the back, which are very long,
are of a deep brown, (in some specimens a
deep black) edged with yellowish white; the
greater quills are brown; the vent and upper
tail-coverts black.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wigeons commonly fly in small flocks during
the night, and may be known from others
by their whistling note while they are on the
wing. They are easily domesticated in places
where there is plenty of water, and are much
admired for their beauty, sprightly look, and
busy frolicsome manners.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tail, which consists of fourteen feathers,
is of a hoary brownish ash, edged with yellowish
white; the two middle ones are sharp-pointed,
darker and longer than the rest.
The legs and toes are of a dirty lead colour,
faintly tinged with green; the middle of the
webs and nails black. The female is brown,
the middle of the feathers deepest; the fore
part of the neck and breast paler; scapulars
dark brown, with paler edges; wings and belly
as in the male. The young of both sexes
are grey, and continue in that plain garb till
the month of February, after which a change
takes place, and the plumage of the male begins
to assume its rich colourings, in which it
is said he continues till the end of July, and
then again the feathers become dark and grey,
so that he is hardly to be distinguished from
the female.</p>

<p class='c006'>These birds quit the desert morasses of the
north on the approach of winter, and as they
advance towards the end of their destined
southern journey, they spread themselves
along the shores and over the marshes and
lakes in various parts of the continent, as well
as those of the British isles, and it is said that
some of the flocks advance as far south as
Egypt. They remain in these parts during
the winter, at the end of which the old birds
pair, and the whole tribe in full plumage take
their departure northward about the end of
March. While they remain with us, they
frequent the same places, and feed in the same
mode as the mallard, and are often taken in
the decoys along with them and other kinds
of ducks.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wild</span>, <i>a.</i> Not tame, not domestic; propagated by nature, not cultivated;

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wild</span>, <i>s.</i> A desert, a tract uncultivated and uninhabited.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wild Dog</span>, <i>s.</i> An untrained dog; a dog run wild.</p>

<p class='c006'>In December, 1784, a dog was left by a
smuggling vessel near Boomer, on the coast of
Northumberland. Finding himself deserted,
he began to worry sheep, and did so much
damage that he was the terror of the country,
within the circuit of above twenty miles. It
is asserted that when he caught a sheep, he
bit a hole in the right side, and after eating
the fat about the kidneys, left it. Several of
them thus lacerated were found alive by the
shepherds, and being properly taken care of
some of them recovered and afterwards had
lambs. From this delicacy of his feeding, the
destruction may in some measure be conceived,
as the fat of one sheep in a day would
scarcely satisfy his hunger. Various were the
means used to destroy him; frequently was
he pursued with hounds, greyhounds, &amp;c., but
when the dogs came up to him he laid down
on his back, as if supplicating for mercy, and
in that position they never hurt him; he
therefore laid quietly, taking his rest till the
hunters approached, when he made off without
being followed by the hounds, till they were
again excited to the pursuit, which always terminated
unsuccessfully. He was one day
pursued from Howick to upwards of thirty
miles’ distance, but returned thither and killed
sheep the same evening. His constant residence
was upon a rock on the Heugh Hill,
near Howick, where he had a view of four
roads that approached it, and there, in March
1785, after many fruitless attempts, he was at
last shot.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Another wild dog, which had committed
devastation among the sheep, near Wooler,
in the same county (Northumberland) was
on the 6th of June, 1799, advertised to be
hunted on the Wednesday following by three
packs of hounds, which were to meet at different
places; the aid of men and firearms was
also requested, with a reward promised of
twenty guineas to the person killing him.
This dog was described by those who had seen
him at a distance, as a large greyhound, with
some white in his face, neck, and one foreleg
white, rather grey on the back, and the rest
a jet black; an immense concourse of people
assembled at the time appointed, but the chase
was unprosperous; for he eluded his pursuers
among the Cheviot Hills, and what is singular
returned that same night to the place from
whence he had been hunted in the morning,
and worried an ewe and her lamb. During
the whole summer he continued to destroy
sheep, but changed his quarters, for he infested
the fells, sixteen miles south of Carlisle,
where upwards of sixty sheep fell victims to
his ferocity. In September, hounds and fire-arms
were again employed against him, and
after a run from Carrock Fell, which was
computed to be thirty miles, he was shot
whilst the hounds were in pursuit, by Mr.
Lewel of Wedlock, who laid in ambush at
Moss Dale. During the chase, which occupied
six hours, he frequently turned upon
the headmost hounds, and wounded several
so badly as to disable them. Upon examination
he appeared of Newfoundland breed, of a
common size, wire-haired, and extremely lean.
This description does not tally with the dogs so
injurious to the farmers in Northumberland,
although from circumstances there is little
doubt but it was the same animal.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wildfire</span>, <i>s.</i> A composition of inflammable materials, easy to take fire,
and hard to be extinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wild Fowl Shooting</span>, <i>s.</i> To shoot water fowl.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the time of long frosts, if going on
the water or into the marshes, after the wild
fowl, does not suit the shooter’s convenience
or choice, by attending the brooks and small
rivers that are only partially frozen early of a
morning, and following their course, he may
frequently find diversion, and be almost certain
of meeting with wild ducks searching
both for food and fresh water; he will be also
equally sure to get shots, for they will not
rise until he is close upon them. In extreme
severity of frost, with hard and permanent snow,
the warm springs which do not freeze are spots
that then seldom fail, as the wild ducks are
confined to these places in order to procure
the aquatic herbs growing there, and which
are almost the sole food that remains for them
at this inclement period.</p>

<p class='c006'>In following wild fowl, it is easier to get
within twenty yards of them by going to leeward,
than a hundred and fifty if directly to
windward; so very acute is their sense of
smelling.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The coast between Hampshire and the Isle
of Wight is peculiar, consisting, at ebb tide, of
vast muddy flats, covered with green sea-weed:
it affords the fowler an opportunity of
practising arts perhaps not elsewhere resorted
to. Fowling and fishing are indeed on this
coast commonly the employment of the same
person. He who in summer with his line or
net, plies the shores, when they are overflowed
by the tide; in winter, with his gun, as evening
draws on, runs up in his boat among the
little creeks, which the tide leaves in the
mudlands, and lies in patient expectation of
his prey. Sea-fowl usually feed by night,
when, in all their multitudes, they come
down to graze on the savannahs of the shore.
As the sonorous cloud advances, the attentive
fowler listens which way they bend their
course:—perhaps he has the mortification to
hear them alight at too great a distance for
his gun to reach them; and if he cannot edge
his boat round some winding creek, which it
is not always in his power to do, he despairs
of success that night: perhaps, however, he is
more fortunate, and has the satisfaction to
hear the airy noise approach nearer, till at
length the host settles in some place upon the
edge of which his boat is moored. He now,
as silently as possible, primes both his pieces
anew, (for he is generally doubly armed) and
listens with all his attention: it is so dark
that he can take no aim; for if he could discern
the birds, they would also see him; and
being exceedingly timorous, would seek some
other pasture. Though they march with
noise, they feed in silence; some indistinct
noises, however, if the night be still, issue
from so vast a concourse; he directs his piece,
therefore, towards the sound, fires at a venture,
and instantly catching up his other gun,
discharges it where he supposes the flock to
rise on the wing. His gains for the night are
now decided, and he has only to gather his
harvest. He immediately puts on his mud
pattens (flat square pieces of board, which the
fowler ties to his feet, that he may not sink
in the ooze) ignorant yet of his success, and
goes groping about in the dark in quest of his
booty, picking up sometimes many, and
perhaps none. And, after all, others frequently
enjoy more from his labours than
himself: for the tide often throws, next day,
on different parts of the shore, many of the
birds which he killed, but could not find in
the night.</p>

<p class='c006'>This hazardous occupation once led a fowler
into singular distress:—it happened too
in the day-time, which shows still more forcibly
the risk of such nocturnal expeditions.
Mounted on his mud pattens, he was traversing
one of these oozy plains in search of ducks,
and, being intent only on his game, suddenly
found the water, which had been accelerated
by some peculiar circumstance affecting the
tide, had made an alarming progress around
him, and he found himself completely encircled:
in this desperate situation, an idea struck
him, as the only hope of safety. He retired
to that part which seemed the highest, from
its being yet uncovered by water, and striking
the barrel of his long gun deep in the ooze,
he resolved to hold fast by it, as well for a
support as a security against the waves, and
to wait the ebbing of the tide.—He had reason
to believe that a common tide would not
have flowed above his middle; but, in the
midst of his reasoning upon the subject, the
water had reached him:—it rippled over his
feet—it gained his knees, his waist:—button
after button was swallowed up, until at length
it flowed over his shoulders! With a palpitating
heart, he gave himself up for lost!
Still, however, he held fast by his anchor:—his
eye was eagerly in search for some boat,
which might accidentally be passing, but none
appeared. A head upon the surface of the
water, and that sometimes covered by a wave,
was no object to be descried from the land, at
the distance of half a league; nor could he
exert any sounds of distress that could be
heard so far! While, as the exigence would
allow, he was thus making up his mind to
the terrors of certain destruction, his attention
was called to a new object:—he thought he
saw the uppermost button of his coat begin to
appear! No mariner floating on a wreck
could behold approaching succour with greater
transport than he felt at the transient view of
his button; but the fluctuation of the water
was such, and the turn of the tide so slow,
that it was yet some time before he durst
venture to assure himself that the button was
fairly above the level of the flood; at length,
a second button appearing at intervals, his
sensations may rather be conceived than
described; and his joy gave him spirits and
resolution to support his situation four or five
hours longer, until the water had fully retired.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Gilpin.</i></p>

who was also a keeper, mention that, in the
reign of George the Second, a large flock of
wild turkeys, consisting of not less than two
thousand, was regularly kept up as part of the
stock of the park. In the autumn and winter
they fed on acorns, of which they must
have had an abundant supply, since the park
was then almost wooded with oak, with a thick
cover of furze; and although at present eleven
miles in circumference, it was formerly much
larger, and connected with extensive possessions
of the Crown, some of which are now
alienated. Stacks of barley were also put in
different places in the park for their support;
and some of the old turkey cocks are said to
have weighed from twenty-five to thirty pounds.
They were hunted with dogs, and made to
take refuge in a tree, where they were frequently
shot by George the Second. I have
not been able to learn how long they had
been preserved in the park before his reign,
but they were totally destroyed towards the
latter end of it, in consequence of the dangers
to which the keepers were exposed in protecting
them from poachers, with whom they
had many bloody fights, being frequently overpowered
by them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though I have not been able, in any of the
accounts which have been given of Richmond
Park, to find a notice of the stock of turkeys;
there can, I think, be no doubt of the fact,
since the ancestors of the present head and
second keepers of the park had, for many
generations, been keepers in it, and have
handed down to their present successors many
curious accounts of the fights which took
place between them and the poachers, in the
preservation of the turkeys.</p>

<p class='c006'>That turkeys would increase rapidly in the
park if left to themselves, there can be no
doubt, as a stray hen turkey brought up a
large brood, which I saw, and which were
quite wild. They kept in a part of the park
little frequented, and if disturbed would take
a flight and settle in trees: they were subsequently
shot, and were in good condition.
Had these birds been suffered to remain, they
would probably have increased rapidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only wild turkeys which I can at present
hear of, are to be found in the park of Sir
Watkin Williams Wynne, at Wynnstay, where
there is a flock consisting of about five hundred.
They were tried in Windsor Great
Park, but did not succeed there. A few bustards
are still to be found near Newmarket;
but I believe they have quite deserted Salisbury
Plain.—<i>Jesse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Willow</span>, <i>s.</i> A tree.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Wind</span>, <i>s.</i> A strong motion of the air; breath, power of respiration; flatulence;
windiness; <i>down the wind</i>, to decoy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thick wind</i> is a common consequence of
either acute or chronic inflammations. In
some instances, it is the immediate consequence
of violent or long-continued exercise,
particularly on a distended stomach and bowels,
or after full drinking; or it may be brought
on by the application of cold. It is often
connected with a plethoric state, and is therefore
very common among gross feeders, and
where the exercise is not proportioned to the
work; and more particularly in low-bred and
thickset horses. The remote causes are usually
increased vascular action; the proximate,
the deposit occasioned by it, which blocks up
the air-cells, and thus interferes with the freedom
of respiration. The post-mortem examinations
of such cases, exhibit, in some instances,
a slight hepatisation of lung, the consequence
of repeated congestions in plethoric
habits; in others, the minute bronchial cells
are filled with adhesive matter, or the general
parenchymatous substance may be pervaded
with minute granulations of a bluish colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of thick wind are sufficiently
known to any one at all conversant with
horses, and the rationale by which they are
produced is not difficult to explain. The
capacity of the air cells being diminished,
renders it necessary for the air to be more
frequently taken in, because, being acted on
by a less surface, the blood is not sufficiently
oxygenated; and a sufficient number of air
cells not being expanded, a sense of fulness
in the right side of the heart induces the animal
to make hasty inspirations to remedy the
defect, and consequently hasty expirations:
the force with which these are operated, occasions
the sound so well known as the distinguishing
mark of thick wind. In this affection,
the obstruction to both being equal, the
inspirations and expirations are equal, which
serves to distinguish it from broken wind, in
which there is no obstruction to the entrance;
and therefore the breath is drawn in with its
usual facility, but is expelled with difficulty.
Thick wind is, however, very apt to degenerate
into that state termed broken wind; and the
post-mortem appearances of such horses as
have been examined under thick wind would
readily, by an increase of the disorganisation,
account for the symptoms of broken wind;
but it cannot be the hepatised lung that is
changed into the emphysematous state.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of thick wind can seldom
be more than palliative, as, once established,
it remains permanent. In very recent cases,
bleeding, blistering the chest, or mildly stimulating
the course of the trachea and bronchia,
by mercurial frictions, to promote the absorption
of any deposit, may be tried. These
having failed, a preventive treatment should
be adopted, calculated to avoid any increase
of the evil, as in the treatment of broken
wind. I have, now and then, witnessed benefit
from repeated doses of mild mercurial
physic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Broken Wind.</i>—The remote causes of
broken wind are hereditary or constitutional
liability, as well as the remaining sufficiently
long under the action of causes capable of exciting
morbid changes in the respiratory organs
themselves. A certain form of body is unquestionably
favourable to its production, and
it is from this circumstance that it proves
hereditary. The narrow confined chest, and
the pendent belly, which mark low bred
horses and gross feeders, all of whom are
observed to be peculiarly liable to it, are predisponents,
by confining the ordinate action of
the lungs, and affording no reserve for the
inordinate. It must be this defect in form
which makes it more common in mares than
horses; subjecting horses to a long-continued
unhealthy course of feeding on dry food, as
chaff, bran, barley meal, &amp;c., &amp;c., brings it on;
or working in mills, where much dust is
necessarily inhaled. It is seldom the immediate
consequence of pneumonia, but frequently
it results from those states of disordered
respiration which succeed to it, as thick
wind, chronic cough, &amp;c. The proximate
causes we are as much in the dark about; we
see that it gradually steals on a horse, occupying
months, and even years, in a slight occasional
cough, which ripening into a state of
slightly impeded respiration on exertion, at
last ends in broken wind. We see it also
follow one hard gallop, and we can leave a
horse well one day, and find him broken-winded
the next.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of this complaint are well
marked; the cough and the mode in which
respiration is performed may be considered as
pathognomonic. The sound emitted by the
cough is peculiar to this asthmatic state, and
is often forced out with a kind of grunt
through the upper part of the trachea, in a
short but vibrating feeble tone compared with
the usual cough of sound winded horses. The
respiration is conducted with a remarkable
difference between the inspirations and expirations.
Inspiration is effected quickly and
with the ordinary ease, because, as would be
argued by those who favour the opinion that
an emphysematous state of lungs is the sole
cause of this equine asthma, the air is supposed
readily to find its way into the cellular
tissue of the ruptured air-cells, where, becoming
entangled, it occasions that remarkable
difference in the ease with which inspiration
is effected and the lengthened laborious effort
of expiration, which, it may be observed, is
performed by two distinct efforts, in one of
which the usual muscles operate, and in the
other the auxiliary muscles, particularly the
abdominal, which are put on the stretch to
complete the expulsion more perfectly; after
which the flank falls with peculiar force, when
these muscles resume their relaxations. An
auxiliary symptom is the peculiar flatulence
of every broken-winded horse, which is strikingly
characteristic of that disordered state of
digestion so common in these cases, and of
that constant thirst also which is invariably
present.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of broken wind can seldom
be more than palliative. Whatever increases
the distension of the vessels generally, as a
state of plethora, or of the stomach and bowels
particularly, aggravates the complaint by increasing
the difficulty of expanding the lungs.
Therefore, avoid stimulants, and promote regular
evacuations by the bowels; abstain from
over-distension of the lungs by too violent and
too sudden exertions, particularly after eating;
for the food, although it may be supposed to
pass the stomach quickly, yet is retained longer
in the large intestines, which equally press on
the diaphragm. By carefully attending to
these principal indications, a broken-winded
horse may be rendered comfortable to himself,
and useful to his owner. The food should be
regularly given in moderate quantities only;
but most particularly it should be of such a
nature as will contain much nutriment in a
small space: hence corn is more proper than
hay, and, above all, I have found a manger
food composed of one part bran, one part
bruised beans, and two parts braised oats,
agree particularly well, given somewhat moistened,
as indeed all the food given to a broken-winded
horse should be. On a sufficient
quantity of this food a horse will need but
very little hay, and what he does have should
be of the oldest and best kind, and principally
given at night as a condiment to the corn.
When they can be got, give also carrots, mangel
wurzel, Swedish turnips, parsneps, or
cooked potatoes, which feeding will be found
to combine both medicine and nutriment, and
render little water necessary. Turning out to
grass commonly aggravates the symptoms of
broken wind; but a daily run on a very short
pasture is generally found advantageous, and a
neglect of moderate exercise aggravates the
complaint greatly; water should be sparingly
given, particularly in the working hours: at
night, a moderate quantity may and should be
allowed, but on no account let the broken-winded
horse drink his fill at a pond or
trough. Medicinally, it may not be improper
to bleed when the occasional symptoms run
high; and benefit has been received from
daily doses of foxglove under these circumstances.
I have also administered antimony
and nitre with advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Modes of distinguishing soundness and
unsoundness of the Wind.</i>—These various
affections of the wind are very important to
the veterinarian, nor can he be too well informed
of the appearances that characterise
each distinctly; because, as their existence
affects the legal soundness of horses, so he
will be very often forced to decide peremptorily
on very slight appearances. To detect
thick wind it is generally necessary that some
time be spent with the horse; and it is often
requisite that he should be examined under
various circumstances. Does he bear moderate
exercise, immediately after eating or
drinking, without blowing high? Does he
cough in so doing, or is he observed to do it
on every change of position, or temperature;
particularly after drinking? And does he
when in the stable, field, or when completely
at rest, occasionally cough short, hollow, and
not followed by that firm effort we call clearing
afterwards? In such a case the horse has
chronic cough; and as his breathing is more
or less accelerated beyond the ordinary standard,
he is more or less thick-winded also.
Roaring may be immediately detected by a
brisk gallop; but the person who is to judge
of its existence should be on the ground, and
the horse should pass him several times, but
without restraint; for I have seen horses
whipped into a momentary cessation of the
roaring.</p>

<p class='c006'>Broken wind can hardly be mistaken; the
cough accompanying it conveys a peculiar
sound; it is short, vibrates within, and is
combined with a grunting effort, more particularly
observable on any sudden motion or
surprise; to produce which, dealers hold up
the horse’s head, and then either strike, or
pretend to strike, him suddenly, or kick him,
which usually elicits this peculiar grunting
sound. The breathing is hurried in the extreme
by exertion, and is remarkable by being
made up of three efforts instead of two. In
the first, the air is drawn in naturally, and
the flanks fill up as usual; but in the next,
the falling of the flanks, again to expel the air,
is most unusual; for it is not done with a
gradual contraction of the muscles, but takes
place at once by a momentary effort; and then
a third action takes place, which is a slow
but strong drawing up of the muscles of the
belly, as though to press out remaining air.
Broken-winded horses are also observed to be
peculiarly greedy after water; and a little
hurried motion distends the nostrils, and produces
evident distress.—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Windgall</span>, <i>s.</i> Windgalls are soft, yielding, flatulent tumours or bladders,

<p class='c006'>Windgalls consist of distended bursæ mucosæ,
which have been described as small
bags or sacs filled with synovia; and interposed
between tendons and the parts upon
which they move; but this is not the case.
Windgalls seldom occasion lameness, and
rarely disappear even after blistering and rest.
Firing and long rest are the most likely means
of strengthening the parts. In cases where
no inconvenience is felt from them this severe
operation is not advisable, but the legs
may be kept bandaged.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fistula of the Withers.</i>—This disease
comes by very severe bruises from the fore
part of the saddle, which being neglected and
repeated from time to time, produces at length
an inflammation of the spinous processes of
the dorsal vertebræ. A deep-seated abscess is
the consequence, and the matter penetrates in
different directions before it arrives at the
surface, where at length it causes a tumour,
which is very different from a common abscess,
and requires always a considerable time
to be cured. To give vent to the matter is
the first object, and when that has been done,
the extent of the injury must be ascertained.
When this cannot be done, and this is sometimes
the case, the caustic tents must be introduced,
as I have described in the chapter
on wounds and bruises; and when the slough
or core which this causes, has separated, which
will generally be in three or four days, the
finger should be introduced as well as a probe,
and the direction of the sinuses ascertained.
A depending opening for the matter to run off
freely must always be obtained, by cutting
open the part freely. If a clean sore has
been thus produced, or if it can be ascertained
that there are no more sinuses or pipes,
the cure may be effected by mild dressings,
or tents of digestive ointment, tincture of
myrrh, &amp;c.; but this is seldom the case, and
repeated dressings with caustic tents are generally
necessary. As soon as the bottom of
the sore is arrived at, it will often be found
that the tops of the spinous processes or the
ligament covering them have been injured,
and the bare bone may be distinctly felt with
the probe. When this is the case the bare
bone must be scraped with a suitable instrument,
and then dressed with tincture of
myrrh; after this the wound will readily heal
by continuing to dress it with tincture of
myrrh or digestive ointment, according to the
directions given on wounds.—<i>White.</i></p>

passage with a long bill.</p>

<p class='c006'>The woodcock measures fourteen inches in
length, and twenty-six in breadth, and generally
weighs about twelve ounces. The shape
of the head is remarkable, being rather triangular
than round, with the eyes placed
near the top, and the ears very forward, nearly
on a line with the corners of the mouth.
The upper mandible, which measures about
three inches, is furrowed nearly its whole
length, and at the tip it projects beyond, and
hangs over the under one, ending in a kind of
knob, which, like those of others of the same
genus, is susceptible of the finest feeling, and
calculated by that means, aided, perhaps by
acute smell, to find the small worms in the
soft moist grounds from whence it extracts
them with its sharp-pointed tongue. With
the bill it also turns over and tosses the fallen
leaves in search of the insects which shelter
underneath. The crown of the head is of an
ash colour, the nape and the back part
of its neck black, marked with three bars
of rusty red: a black line extends from the
corners of the mouth to the eyes, the orbits
of which are pale buff; the whole under
parts are yellowish white, numerously barred
with dark waved lines. The tail consists of
twelve feathers, which, like the quills, are
black, and indented across with reddish spots
on the edges; the tip is ash-coloured above,
and of a glossy white below. The legs are
short, feathered to the knees, and, in some,
are of a bluish cast, in others, of a sallow
flesh colour. The upper parts of the plumage
are so marbled, spotted, barred, streaked and
variegated, that to describe them with accuracy
would be difficult and tedious. The
colours consisting of black, white, grey, ash,
red, brown, rufous, and yellow, are so disposed
in rows, crossed, and broken at intervals
by lines and marks of different shapes,
that the whole seems to the eye, at a little
distance, blended together and confused, which
makes the bird appear exactly like the withered
stalks and leaves of ferns, sticks, moss and
grasses, which form the back ground of the
scenery by which it is sheltered in its moist
and solitary retreats. The sportsman only
being accustomed to it, is enabled to discover
it, and his leading marks are his full dark eye,
and glossy silver white-tipped tail. In plumage
the female differs very little from the male,
and, like most other birds, only by being less
brilliant in her colours.</p>

<p class='c006'>The flesh of the woodcock is held in very
high estimation, and hence it is eagerly sought
after by the sportsman. It is hardly necessary
to notice, that in cooking it, the entrails
are not drawn, but roasted within the bird,
from whence they drop out with the gravy,
upon slices of toasted bread, and are relished
as a delicious kind of sauce.</p>

<p class='c006'>The woodcock is migratory, and in different
seasons is said to inhabit every climate:
it leaves the countries bordering upon the
Baltic, in the autumn and setting in of winter,
on its route to this country. They do
not come in large flocks, but keep dropping
in upon our shores singly, or sometimes in
pairs, from the beginning of October till December.
They must have the instinctive
precaution of landing only in the night, or in
dark misty weather, for they are never seen
to arrive, but are frequently discovered the
next morning in any ditch which affords shelter,
and particularly after the extraordinary
fatigue occasioned by the adverse gales which
they often have to encounter in their aërial
voyage. They do not remain on the shores to
take their rest longer than a day, but commonly
find themselves sufficiently recruited
in that time to proceed inland to the very same
haunts which they left the preceding season.
In temperate weather they retire to the mossy
moors and high bleak mountainous parts of
the country; but as soon as the frost sets in,
and the snow begins to fall, they return to
lower and warmer situations, where they
meet with boggy grounds and springs, and
little oozing mossy rills which are rarely
frozen, and seek the shelter of the close
bushes of holly, furze, and brakes, in the
woody glens, or hollow dells which are covered
with underwood: there they remain concealed
during the day, and remove to different haunts
and feed only in the night. From the beginning
of March to the end of that month, or
sometimes to the middle of April, they keep
drawing towards the coasts, and avail themselves
of the first fair wind to return to their
native woods: should it happen to continue
long to blow adversely, they are thereby detained;
and as their numbers increase, they
are more easily found and destroyed by the
merciless sportsman.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female makes her nest on the ground,
generally at the root or stump of a decayed
tree; it is carelessly formed of a few dried
fibres and leaves, upon which she lays four or
five eggs, larger than those of a pigeon, of a
rusty grey colour, blotched and marked with
dusky spots. The young leave the nest as
soon as they are freed from the shell, but the
parent birds continue to attend and assist them
until they can provide for themselves. Buffon
says they sometimes take a weak one under
their throat, and convey it more than a
thousand paces.</p>

<p class='c006'>Latham mentions three varieties of British
woodcocks: in the first the head is of a pale
red, body white, and the wings brown; the
second is of a dun, or rather cream colour;
and the third of a pure white. Dr. Heysham,
in his catalogue of Cumberland animals, mentions
his having met with one, the general
colour of which was a fine pale ash, with frequent
bars of a very delicate rufous; tail
brown, tipped with white; and the bill and
legs flesh colour. In addition to these, some
other varieties are taken notice of by the late
Marmaduke Tunstall, Esq. of Wycliff, in his
interleaved books on ornithology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Latham and Pennant assert that some
woodcocks deviate from the course which
nature seems to have taught their species, by
remaining throughout the year and breeding
in this country; and this assertion Mr. Tunstall
corroborates by such a number of well
authenticated instances, that the fact is unquestionable.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the woodcock is pursued by the
sportsman, its flight is very rapid but short, as
it drops behind the first suitable sheltering
coppice with great suddenness, and in order to
elude discovery runs swiftly off, in quest of
some place where it may hide itself in greater
security.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>To describe the various methods which are
practised by fowlers to catch this bird would
be tedious; but it may not be improper to
notice those most commonly in use, and
against which it does not seem to be equally
on its guard as against the gun. It is easily
caught in the nets, traps, and springes, which
are placed in its accustomed runs or paths, as
its suspicions are all lulled into security by
the silence of the night; and it will not fly or
leap over any obstacles which are placed in
its way, while it is in quest of its food; therefore
in those places barriers and avenues
formed of sticks, stones, &amp;c., are constructed,
so as to lure it into the fatal openings where
it is entrapped; in like manner, a low fence
made of the tops of broom stuck into the
ground across the wet furrow of a field, or a
runner from a spring which is not frozen, is
sufficient to stay its progress, and to make it
seek from side to side for an opening through
which it may pass, and there it seldom escapes
the noose that is set to secure it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>They leave the north with the first frost,
and travel slowly south till they come to their
accustomed winter quarters, they do not usually
make a quick voyage, but fly from wood
to wood, reposing and feeding on their journey,
they prefer for their haunts woods near
marshes or morasses; they hide themselves
under thick bushes in the day, and fly abroad
to feed in the dusk of the evening. A laurel
or a holly bush is a favourite place for their
repose, the thick and varnished leaves of these
trees prevent the radiation of heat from the
soil, and they are less affected by the refrigerating
influence of a clear sky, so that they
afford a warm seat for the woodcock. Woodcocks
usually begin to fly north on the first
approach of spring, and their flights are generally
longer and their rests fewer at this season
than in autumn. In the autumn they are
driven from the north to the south by the
want of food, and they stop wherever they
can find it. In the spring there is the influence
of another powerful instinct added to
this, the sexual feeling. They migrate in
pairs, and pass as speedily as possible to the
place where they are likely to find food, and
raise their young, and of which the old birds
have already had the experience of former
years. Scarcely any woodcocks winter in any
part of Germany. In France there are few
found, particularly in the southern provinces,
and in Normandy and Britany. The woods
of England, especially of the west and south,
contain always a certain quantity of woodcocks;
but there are far more in the moist
soil and warmer climate of Ireland, but in
the woods of southern Italy and Greece, near
marshes, they are far more abundant, and they
extend in quantities over the Greek islands,
Asia Minor, and northern Africa.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Woodcocks have been known to settle upon
a vessel at sea. Mr. Travers, of Cornwall,
records an instance, when at a distance from
land unusual for birds to be seen, a bird was
discovered hovering over the ship, when first
discerned it was high in the air, but gradually
descended, and after taking several circuits
round, at length alighted on the deck; it was
so wearied as to be taken up by the hand.
Probably this bird had lost its companions, or,
by the force of winds, was driven from the true
aërial track. In 1799 a couple of woodcocks,
seeking shelter from a gale of wind, alighted
upon the Glory man of war, at that time
cruising in the Channel.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In their flight the woodcock, like other
birds, is attracted by a glare of light, and
many instances have occurred, at the Cromer
and Eddystone light-houses, of their falling
victims to it; but in 1796, at the light-house
upon the Hill of Howth, the man who attends
whilst trimming his lamps was surprised by a
violent stroke against the windows, which
broke a pane of plate-glass cast for the place,
more than three-eighths of an inch thick;
on examining the balcony that surrounds the
light he found a woodcock, which had flown
with such violence as to break his bill, head,
breast-bone, and both wings. The man had
often found birds which had killed themselves
by flying against the windows, but never before
knew the glass to be injured.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Upon the Sussex coast woodcocks have been
seen at their first dropping, in considerable
numbers in the church-yard, and even in the
streets of Rye, but during the night, the
usual time of their flying, they removed further
inland, and dispersed. At their first
coming on that coast, they are commonly
poor, as if wasted by their long journey; and
are sometimes scurfy, though not so much as
before their return in the spring; and it is
remarkable, that when the woodcock first
arrives, the taste of its flesh is quite different
from what it is afterwards. It is very white,
short, and tender, and seems to have little or
no blood in it; but after it has been in this
country a considerable time, the flesh becomes
more tough, stringy, and fibrous, like that of
domestic fowls. If a woodcock is shot just
before his departure, it bleeds plentifully,
whereas, at the beginning of winter, scarcely
any blood flows from the wounds, by this it
seems that in those countries, where they
have their summer residence, they have a
different nourishment to that they here find.
Probably the luxuriant and succulent food
which they meet with among us, prepares
them for breeding in those countries where
they retire with the companions of their
choice.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The woodcock feeds indiscriminately upon
earth-worms, small beetles, and various kinds
of larvæ, and its stomach sometimes contains
seeds, which I suspect have been taken up in
boring amongst the excrements of cattle; yet
the stomach of this bird has something of the
gizzard character, though not so much as that
of the landrail, which I have found half filled
with the seeds of grasses, and even containing
corn, mixed with May-bugs, earth-worms,
grasshoppers, and caterpillars.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The time of their appearance and disappearance
in Sweden coincides exactly with that of
their arrival in, and return from, Great Britain.
Their autumnal and vernal appearances
on the coast of Suffolk have been accurately
noticed, they come over sparingly in the first
week in October, the greater numbers not arriving
until November and December, and
always after sun-set. It is the wind and not
the moon, that determines the time of their
arrival, and it is probable that this should be
the case, as they come hither in quest of food,
which fails them in the places they leave; if
the wind has favoured their flight, their stay
on the coast where they drop is very short, if
any, but if they had been forced to struggle
with an adverse gale, such as a ship can hardly
make any way with, they rest a day or two to
recover their fatigue. So greatly has their
strength been exhausted, that they have been
taken by hand in Southwold streets; they do
not come gregariously, but separate and dispersed.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In the same manner as woodcocks quit us,
they retire from France, Germany, and Italy,
making the northern and cold situations their
universal summer rendezvous. They visit
Burgundy the latter end of October, but continue
there only four or five weeks; it being
a dry country, they are forced away, for want
of sustenance, by the first frost. In the winter
they are found in vast plenty as far south
as Smyrna and Aleppo; during the same
season, in Barbary, where the Africans call
them the ass of the partridge. It has been
asserted that some have appeared as far south
as Egypt, which is the remotest migration to
which they can be traced on that side the
Eastern world; on the other side they are
very common in Japan. The woodcocks that
resort into the countries of the Levant, probably
come from the deserts of Siberia or
Tartary, or the old mountains of Armenia.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In the neighbourhood of Athens, hares and
other game are purchased for little more than
the value of powder and shot. In winter
woodcocks abound, descending, after snow on
the mountains, into the plains; and suddenly
retiring if the weather continues severe, they
enter the gardens of the town in great distress,
rather than cross the sea, and are sometimes
caught with the hand.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>It has been the belief that the woodcock
has two broods in the year, because young
ones have been found, just hatched, in the
month of August; but I think the cause of
the supposition is this,—that as woodcock
shooting, at flight time, continues till late in
the summer, some of the males may have
been shot, and a new pair may have been
formed later than usual. If in shooting you
meet with a brood of woodcocks, and the
young ones cannot fly, the old bird takes the
young ones separately between her feet, and
flies from the dogs with a moaning cry.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The woodcock, as it is well known, is a
bird of passage. It usually took its departure
from Sweden towards the end of October or
beginning of November, and did not return
until the approach of spring. Mr. Grieff
says, he never knew the woodcock to make
his appearance in the vicinity of Stockholm
until the 6th of April, which about tallies
with the time of their leaving our shores.</p>

<p class='c006'>Woodcocks were exceedingly scarce in the
vicinity of Stfirn, which was also the case in
all other parts of Scandinavia that I ever visited.
This may be supposed when I mention
that I never killed more than three in any
one day during my stay in the north of Europe.
Indeed I never saw more than seven
or eight of those birds in the course of a day’s
shooting, and very generally not one-fourth
part so many. During the woodcock’s periodical
migrations, however, for during the winter
not one of them remains in Scandinavia,
they are occasionally, as it is said, to be met
with in considerable numbers on the western
coasts of Sweden and Norway.</p>

<p class='c006'>As it is from the countries of which I am
now speaking our covers are supposed to be
supplied with woodcocks, it may seem extraordinary
that those birds should there be so
scarce as I have just described, and so plentiful
in places with us. This, however, is easily
explained, when we consider, that on their
breeding grounds, extending over the whole of
the north of Europe, there is probably a thousand
times as much wood as in the United
Kingdom; and, consequently, when they
come to us, and are concentrated, if I may
use the term, into our small covers, they
naturally make a very great show.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is generally said that woodcocks are less
plentiful in Great Britain than formerly.
This I have heard attributed to the Scandinavians
eating the eggs of those birds. If, however,
persons who entertain this opinion were
to see the almost boundless northern forests,
they would probably think with me, that if
the whole of the scanty population of that
part of the world were to go out for the purpose,
they would not be able to explore the
hundredth part of the woods in the course of
a year, and consequently they could not take
or destroy any considerable number of eggs.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In 1796, Mr. Yea, of Swansea, killed one
hundred couple of woodcocks in one season.
In Ireland, the Earl of Claremont shot half
as many in a day, but then it should be premised,
that such was the abundance of these
birds, as to be sold in some parts (for instance,
near Ballyshannon, in the County of Donegal)
for one penny each, and the expense of
powder and shot.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>In the winter of 1797, the gamekeeper of
E. M. Pleydell, Esq., of Whatcomb, Dorsetshire,
brought him a woodcock which he had
caught in a net set for rabbits, alive and unhurt.
Mr. P. scratched the date upon a bit
of thin brass, bent it round the woodcock’s
leg, and let it fly. In December next year,
Mr. Pleydell shot this bird with the brass
about its leg, in the very same wood where it
had been first caught by the keeper.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Woodcock Fancier.</i>—Mr. Jeremiah Tupman,
who died about thirteen years since at
Berkeley, caught upon his estate at Lyston,
a young male woodcock, which he carefully
reared, and having procured a mate for it,
they bred in considerable abundance. He
was so pleased with his success, that he actually
altered his will, which was originally made in
favour of a young lady, and left his fortune to
the minister at Berkeley, to be principally
laid out in the breed of woodcocks, upon the
neglect of which the estate was to revert to
the family relations; a reversion for which
probably the family were not long in expectancy.—<i>Bewick</i>—<i>Davy</i>—<i>Grieff</i>—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>Wild

<p class='c006'>Of these only three or four kinds are found
in Great Britain. Their characters are striking,
and their manners singular. The bill is
large, strong, and fitted for its employment:
the end of it is formed like a wedge, with
which it pierces the bark of trees, and bores
into the wood in which its food is lodged. Its
neck is short and thick, and furnished with
powerful muscles, which enables it to strike
with such force as to be heard at a considerable
distance: its tongue is long and taper;
at the end of it there is a hard horny substance,
which penetrates into the crevices of
trees, and extracts the insects and their eggs
which are lodged there: the tail consists of
ten stiff, sharp-pointed feathers, bent inwards,
by which it supports itself on the trunks of
trees while in search of food; for this purpose
its feet are short and thick, and its toes, which
are placed two forward and two backward, are
armed with strong hooked claws, by which it
clings firmly, and creeps up and down in all
directions.—<i>Bewick.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This species weighs about twenty ounces;
length eighteen inches. The bill yellowish;
irides light yellow; the head, coverts of the
wings, and scapulars are of a deep bluish ash
colour; the neck and breast vinaceous, beautifully
glossed with green and copper colour,
changeable in different lights; on each side
the neck is a large patch of glossy white,
which almost joins behind; the back and tail
ash colour, the latter black at the end; vent
and thighs white, tinged with ash colour; the
bastard wing almost black, behind which a few
of the coverts are white, forming a line down
to the greater quills, which are dusky, edged
with white; the legs are feathered much below
the knee, which, with the feet, are of a
purplish red. There is little or no distinction
in the plumage of the sexes; but the female
is not quite so large.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Woodward</span>, <i>s. obs.</i> A forester.</p>

<p class='c006'>A subject who has lived within a forest,
according to usage, ought to have a woodward;
and if he does not appear at the justice
seat, the wood shall be seized into the king’s
hands, till he makes fine and replevy it; and
if he do not replevy it within a year, it shall

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Worm</span>, <i>s.</i> A small harmless serpent that lives in the earth; a poisonous

<p class='c006'>When the day is dark or lowering, and a
gentle whistling wind plays on the water, or a
fine mizzling rain falls without violence; likewise
when trout leap out of the water, and pike
shoot after other fishes; and also when a sudden
shower has mudded and raised the water,
if the angler tries on the sides of the stream
at the ground, with brandling, gilt tail, or red
worm, well scoured, he will have diversion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The ash grub or bank-worm</i> is plump, milk
white, and bent round from head to tail, with
a red head, resembling a young humble bee,
and is exceedingly tender; it is found under
the bark of oak, ash, birch, or alder, especially
if they lie a year after they are felled;
it is also met with in the body of a rotten
alder, when broken in pieces, but care must
be observed in breaking the tree, that the
worm is not crushed; it is sometimes found
under the bark of an old decayed stump of a
tree. It is best kept in bran, and will by
that means be made tougher; but at the best
they are so tender, that great caution must
be observed in their use; the hook, which
must be armed with a bristle to prevent its
slipping down, should be introduced under its
head, and guided down the middle of the
belly, without suffering it to break the skin
in its passage (for if it does, water and milk
will issue from the wound, until nothing but
the skin remains, when the bent of the hook
will appear black through it), until the point
of the hook comes so low that the head of
the grub may rest on the bristle that projects
to hold it; it will be thus defended from
slipping off by its own exertions, nor will the
force of the stream or quick pulling it out of
the water, strip it off.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The brandling worm</i> is streaked from head
to tail in alternate red and yellow circles; is
dark at the head; becomes gradually paler
towards the tail. Brandlings are found in old
dunghills which consist of hogs’ and horses’
dung and rotten earth; also in old thatch and
dung; in grass mown from garden walks after
it has lain some time: but those which are
found in tanners’ bark, after being used and
laid by until quite rotten, are the best, and
may generally be used without any scouring.
When brandlings are kept in mosses like the
lob-worm, they should be fed by dropping a
little cream, about a spoonful a day, upon the
moss; it will prevent their swelling at the
knot near their middle, which, when it takes
place, usually kills them. With some anglers
it is a rule not to use these worms and the
gilt tail until they have been in moss two
days, nor after they have continued in it more
than ten.</p>

<p class='c006'>The short <i>white worms</i> or <i>bobs</i> are of two
sorts: the one found in mellow, heathy,
sandy soils, and is easily gathered by following
the plough in autumn, when such ground
is first broken up from grazing; also by digging
one spot deep in the above described lands
sufficient may be got. Those of this class are
called the earth bob, white grub, or white
bait, and are as big again as a gentle; have a
pale red head, very soft all over, are yellowish
at the tail, and their bodies when taken in
some degree resemble the colour of the earth
where found in, but when scoured are of a
pale white. They are an excellent winter
bait, and to preserve them they should be put
into a large earthen pot with some of its own
earth, with dryish moss at the top, and set in
a warm place.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dunghill red worms are small and knotted,
of a bright red, and are to be found almost in
every heap of horsedung that has much straw
rotted in it. Cowdung red worms are found
in the fields, and in nearly dry flakes of dung;
their heads are shining dark brown, with flat
tails, are good baits, and may occasionally be
used when taken, but are best scoured and
preserved, like other worms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dock or flag-worm is of the colour of a
gentle, when scoured, but is longer and slenderer
in his make, with rows of feet down his
belly, and a red head. They are found by
pulling up the flags growing round an old
pond or pit, shaking the roots in the water,
and when free from dirt, amongst the fibres
that spread from the roots, will be seen little
husks of a reddish or yellowish colour; these
must be opened very cautiously with a pin,
and the worm either used immediately, or
dropt into some bran to carry them, where
they may be preserved in the same manner as
the cad-bait; they sometimes insinuate themselves
into the body of the round stalk of the
flag.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long dock-worms are of a fine pale red,
without knots; are chiefly found in moist
places, near dock-roots, and are best taken by
shaking the earth with a dung-fork. They are
excellent baits, especially for carp and tench.
In the hollow parts near the roots of the
largest sort of sedges, may be found a large
black-headed grub, about an inch long, and
which is not to be found in any other place;
it is a famous bait for pond-fishing, though extremely
tender; but by putting them into
boiling milk for about two minutes, the morning
you mean to use them, they will be rendered
tougher.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gilt-tails are paler and larger than the last-mentioned
worms; are knotted like them,
are of a pale yellow, especially towards the
tail.</p>

<p class='c006'>The marsh-worms are middle-sized and
knotted; are of a bluish cast and tender; are
to be found in the rich banks of rivers, and in
marshy ground, wherein they are usually got
by treading the ground when it is moist, much
backwards and forwards, or in circles, with
both feet close together; they require more
scouring in moss than most other worms, at
least fifteen days, but are very lively good
baits.</p>

<p class='c006'>White or marl worms are found chiefly in
marl or clay land by following the plough,
and also in turnip fields, where the soil is of
a stiffish quality; the head is very small, and
of a pale red; they are larger than the brandling,
and naturally tough, are a good bait,
especially in muddy water; may be preserved
in some of their own earth, keeping it properly
damp; with some moss at top, and when
scoured are of a pale white.</p>

<p class='c006'>The red worm is found in all loamy soils;
may be collected by following a plough, turning
up garden soil, and under boards, bricks,
slates, tiles, stones, &amp;c. that have lain undisturbed
for any time: these four worms may
be preserved together in one pot, and when
the brandling or others are meant to be used,
let the angler, the evening before, pick them
out by themselves, and put them into a bag,
with moss moistened with sweet thinnish
cream, and they will appear more bright and
tempting to the fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tag-tail is a worm of a pale flesh-colour,
with a yellow tag, almost half an inch
long: it is found in marled land or meadows,
after a shower, or in the morning, in calm and
not cold weather in March and April. In
discoloured water by rain, it is considered a
fatal bait for trout. They will not endure
long scouring.</p>

<p class='c006'>A three-prong dung-fork thrust into the
ground, and continually moving it, will force
all the worms within a certain distance to
come instantly out of their holes; supposing,
from the shaking of the earth, it is the mole’s
heaving to come at them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Get a parcel of cow or horse-hair, and cut
it five or six inches long, into a pan; throw
the worms upon it, and in a couple of hours
they will have cleared themselves from the
chief of their dirt; take them from amongst
the hair, observing that none of it sticks to
them, and selecting out the dead or wounded
worms; clean the pan from the hair and filth,
and put the worms into it, covering them with
garden mould, about an inch thick: they will
keep a very long time in this manner, moistening
it once a day with new milk, and
changing it every month, to prevent the
growth of young worms, which would occasion
the death and decay of the old.</p>

<p class='c006'>Amongst the old recipes for scouring worms,
the putting them into a powder got from a
dead man’s skull, by beating it to atoms, was
deemed super-excellent.</p>

<p class='c006'>When worms are wanted for immediate
use, and no provision has been made, the way
to scour them quickly, is, if lob-worms, to put
them all night in water; brandlings must not
remain above one hour in it, and both sorts
must be then put with fennel into the angler’s
worm-bag.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Worms of different kinds inhabit the intestines;
but except when they exist in very
great numbers, they are not so hurtful as is
generally supposed, although the groom or
carter may trace to them hidebound, and
cough, and loss of appetite, and gripes, and
megrims, and a variety of other ailments.
Of the origin or mode of propagation of these
parasitical animals we will say nothing; neither
writers on medicine, nor even on natural
history, have given us any satisfactory account
of the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The long white worm (<i>lumbricus teres</i>)
much resembling the common earth-worm,
and, being from six to ten inches long, inhabits
the small intestines. It is a formidable
looking animal, and if there are many of them,
they may consume more than can be spared
of the nutritive part of the food, or the mucus
of the bowels; and we think that we have
seen a tight skin, and rough coat, and tucked
up belly, connected with their presence. They
have then, however, been voided in large
quantities, and when they are not thus voided,
we should be disposed to trace these appearances
to other causes. A dose of physic will
sometimes bring away almost incredible quantities
of them. Calomel is frequently given
as a vermifuge. The seldomer this drug is
administered to the horse the better. It is
the principal ingredient in some quack medicines
for the expulsion of worms in the human
subject, and thence, perhaps, it came to
be used for the horse; but in him we believe
it to be inert as a vermifuge, or only useful
as quickening the operation of the aloes.
When the horse can be spared, a strong dose
of physic is an excellent vermifuge, so far as
the long round worm is concerned; but perhaps
a better medicine, and not interfering
with either the feeding or work of the horse,
is two drachms of emetic tartar, with a scruple
of ginger, made into a ball, with linseed meal
and treacle, and given every morning half an
hour before the horse is fed.</p>

<p class='c006'>A smaller, darker coloured worm, called
the needle worm, or <i>ascaris</i>, inhabits the
large intestines. Hundreds of them sometimes
descend into the rectum, and immense
quantities have been found in the cœcum.
These are a more serious nuisance than the
former, for they cause a very troublesome
irritation about the fundament, which sometimes
sadly annoys the horse. Their existence
can generally be discovered by a small portion
of mucus, which hardening, is converted into
a powder, and is found about the anus. Physic
will sometimes bring away great numbers
of these worms; but when there is much irritation
about the tail, and much of this mucus,
indicating that they have descended into the
rectum, an injection of a quart of linseed oil,
or of an ounce of aloes dissolved in warm
water, will be a more effectual remedy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tape worm is seldom found in the
horse.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Worms are most commonly found in the
bowels and stomach; but they are sometimes
met with also in almost every part of the
body. The worms commonly found in the
stomach are named botts. They are generally
attached to the cuticular or insensible coat of
the stomach; but sometimes clusters of them
are found at the pylorus, and even in the beginning
of the first intestine, named duodenum.
In one case they were so numerous in
this last situation as to obstruct the passage
completely, and cause the animal’s death.
Botts are short thick reddish worms, surrounded
with short prickles, which are arranged
in circular bands all over the body.
They attach themselves firmly by two hooks,
which they appear to have the power of
straightening and retracting, of projecting and
curvating. They are extremely tenacious of
life, and difficult to be expelled from the stomach,
except about the month of September,
or when a horse is taken up from grass. At
this period they may generally be got rid of
by brine, or a solution of common salt in
water, in a dose of from four to five ounces
of salt to a quart of water. The horse should
be kept fasting the night before it is given;
and about five minutes before the drench
with salt is given, let the horse be drenched
with about a pint of warm milk, sweetened
with honey or treacle.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Mercurial physic seems to be generally
considered the most effectual, especially when
a little calomel is given for two or three successive
nights, and followed up by a dose of
physic. I have seen small doses of aloes
given daily, about two drachms, with good
effect. Oil of turpentine is a powerful vermifuge,
if given after some hours’ fasting,
and when the bowels have been brought into
a lax state by giving bran mashes for two or
three days, or a small dose (about three
drachms) of aloes the day before.</p>

<p class='c006'>This previous fasting, as well as keeping the
horse without food two hours after, is necessary
to the success of this remedy. In a few
instances, oil of turpentine has produced
alarming symptoms; and in one case, where
a horse had taken a mild dose of physic the
day before, it brought on almost immediately
a fatal inflammation of the stomach and
bowels. On the other hand, a great number
of cases have been reported to me in which it
has been given with the best effect. I should
be inclined, however, to try the mercurial
purgative first; but even this, in the horse, is
attended with some danger, unless he is managed
judiciously before, and during its operation.
The third remedy is of a milder nature,
but often, I believe, inert; that is, bitter
vegetables, such as rue, box, savine, &amp;c.,
which are chopped up and given with the
horse’s corn. Ethiop’s mineral, levigated antimony,
emetic tartar, very small doses of
arsenic and calomel, have each of them sometimes
succeeded. But, whatever worm medicine
is given, the horse should be kept without
food for several hours, or the whole night
before, and two hours after. Chopped horse-hair
has been given with success, and brine,
or a solution of common salt. In one case,
a great number of worms were discharged by
fasting the horse during the night, and giving
him a malt mash in the morning. Another
method is to keep the horse without food during
the night, and give him in the morning a
quart of new milk sweetened with honey, and
about ten minutes after, four, five, or six
ounces of salt in a quart of water. A run at
grass in the spring is, perhaps, the best remedy
of all, for it is the most effectual means
of invigorating the digestive organs, and purifying
the blood. When it is not convenient
to turn the horse out, he should be soiled in
the stable with vetches. The most certain
indication of worms, except that of their being
discharged with the horse’s dung, is a
yellowish or brimstone-coloured stain under
the fundament. Sometimes worms produce
symptoms of an unusual kind, as in the following
case:—A horse was observed for some
time to fall off in flesh and become weak,
and, upon attempting to mount him, he
shrunk and gave way in the back, as if he
had received some severe injury in that part;
they gave him, however, a dose of mercurial
physic, which brought off a lump of worms
and viscid mucus as large as a man’s fist.
After this the horse was perfectly free from
pain in the back, and quickly recovered his
flesh and strength. I have heard of a horse
being cured of worms, when reduced by them
to such a degree of weakness that he was
thought incurable, by being turned into a field
of young vetches. Powdered tin has been
recommended for worms, and may be given
without danger in a dose of three or four
drachms made into a ball with flour and honey.
With regard to the short red worms,
named botts, so often found in the horse’s
stomach, adhering in large clusters, most commonly
to the insensible coat, but sometimes
to the pylorus, the most likely means of expelling
them is to give a drench of salt and
water in the manner before prescribed; that
is, to keep the horse without food during the
night, and in the morning to give him a quart
of new milk sweetened with honey; about
ten minutes after this drench is down, the
drench of salt and water is to be given. This
remedy should be employed in September, or
soon after a horse is taken from grass. Botts
are so often found in the horse’s stomach, that
they have been supposed to do no harm; it is
certain, however, that they sometimes produce
the most serious diseases. They sometimes
cause ulceration and sloughing of the stomach,
inflammation of the lungs and heart, and
frenzy or mad staggers. According to Gibson
they sometimes cause locked-jaw. Botts
appear to be the larvæ of a fly, and are probably
eaten with grass or hay. According to
Mr. Bracy Clark, the fly deposits its eggs on
the horse’s coat; and, when they are about to
be hatched, the horse licks them off, so that
they are hatched by the warmth of the mouth
and the moisture of the saliva, and then swallowed.
Mr. Feron says he has paid particular
attention to this subject, and has found
that, when in large quantities, they are very
destructive to horses; that he has seen several
horses whose stomachs had been pierced quite
through by them, the botts making their way
into the abdomen. He thinks they are taken
in with the horse’s forage, whether dry or
green, as they are found in horses that have
not been at grass for several years, but that
they may also be licked in from the horse’s
coat. He is of opinion that botts, when once
attached to the stomach, may remain there
during the horse’s life, and it is only when
they become too numerous that they are
forced off and discharged by the bowels. Mr.
James Clarke relates a case of a horse’s stomach
being perforated by botts. I have seen
several horses destroyed by botts. In some
of them, they caused inflammation of the
lungs; in one frenzy, or mad staggers. In
one horse the pylorus was completely plugged
up with them. There is a remarkable sympathy
or consent between the stomach and
the lungs, and it is owing to this that they
sometimes cause inflammation of the lungs.
In the cases which have occurred in my practice,
the most remarkable circumstance was
the great depression they occasioned, and the
inefficacy of copious bleeding. Castor oil
seemed to do more good than anything, and
Mr. Feron remarks that common oil, given
in large quantities, has sometimes succeeded
in detaching botts from the stomach; and he
adds, it is the only medicine that seems to
have any effect in making them lose their
hold from the stomach. There is a kind of
worm I have often met with since I have
practised in Somersetshire, especially at Oakhill,
which appears to do a great deal of mischief.
When drawn out, they are from one
to three or four inches in length, from one to
two eighths of an inch in breadth, and scarcely
of any thickness; they have numerous transverse
lines close to each other, like those of
the leach, and adhere firmly to the bowels by
one of their extremities. When viewed
through a microscope, the transverse lines appear
as upright scales applied very near to
each other, and inclining, I think, a little
forwards; the extremity, by which they adhere
to the gut, appears as a bulb with holes
in it; the other extremity is square, as if it
had been cut off transversely. These worms
are generally of a white colour, and sometimes
drawn up or contracted so as to appear
as a flake of mucus, or fat, of about half an
inch in length. I have seen them of a darker
colour in horses that were in a state of great
poverty, and sometimes reddish, as if containing
blood. In many dogs and cats that have
been opened at Oakhill, they have been
almost invariably found; and they have been
discharged, in this village, from the bowels of
men and children. They are found both in
the small and large bowels, most commonly
in the former, and near the part where the
ilium terminates in the cœcum. At Easton,
near Wells, this worm has been seen swimming
in a small stream that runs through the
village, from which it is probable that their
natural habitation is water, and that they are
swallowed while the animal is drinking, and
are capable of living in the bowels.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Method of worming dogs.</i>—Secure a large
dog on his back on a table, bench, or form;
one of a middling size may be held in the lap
of an assistant; a small one may be conveniently
taken into that of the operator. The
mouth being held open by means of two pieces
of tape—one embracing the part immediately
behind the <i>upper</i>, and the other that <i>posterior</i>
to the lower canine teeth—draw the
tongue from the mouth, when, exposing its
under surface, a cuticular fold or eminence
will present itself, occupying its median line
from the point to the base: open this with a
lancet through its whole extent, which will
expose a minute fibrous cord. Pass a blunt-pointed
probe under it, and, carrying the instrument
from one end to the other, detach
the cord from its adhesions; which done, divide
it at one extremity, and carefully drawing
it forwards with a tenaculum, divide the other
also. The uninitiated in sporting mysteries
may smile at all this minuteness of detail, and
recommendation of caution, in the <i>division</i>
of a <i>line</i> of <i>skin</i>, and the <i>extraction</i> of a
<i>thread</i> of ligament; but all this is actually
necessary to satisfy the prejudices of those who
put faith in the operation. For with them it
is essential to the prospective benefits of it,
not only that the whole of the <i>worm</i> (for
which read frænum) should be extracted, but
that, if possible, it should be done in one continuous
mass.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the removal of this cord by huntsmen,
game-keepers, &amp;c., the violence used in stripping
it off, puts its fibrous substance so much
on the stretch, that when extracted, its elasticity
making it recoil, gives it somewhat the
character of the contraction of a dying <i>worm</i>;
and we may yet read of this appearance, and
its general form, being adduced as proofs of its
vermicular identity. And although now no
informed person gives credence to its being
other than a portion of the canine tongue; yet
there are many sporting characters of education
and ability, who still lend themselves to
an opinion that there is some enigmatical property
inherent in this part, which renders its
retention dangerous, by making the unwormed
dog the subject of acute rabies, but the wormed
one the subject of the dumb variety. Of a
piece with this palpable error was that of Marochetti’s
vesicles in the same vicinage; which
being also with him the hiding-place of the
rabid virus, it became as necessary, according
to his doctrine, to destroy them as it was with
the ancients (and yet remains with some of
the moderns) to remove the <i>worm</i>.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Of these worms which appear indigenous to
the intestines of the dog, the <i>tænia</i>, or tape
worm, from its flat figure, is the most prejudicial,
and the most difficult to remove. I
have known four or five hundred joints (each
a distinct animal) passed by a dog, whose
united length would encircle his body many
times. Sometimes they become coiled up into
a ball, which thus forms an impenetrable obstruction
within the intestines, and destroys
the dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>teres</i>, or long cylindrical worms, resembling
earthworms in figure, but of a whitish
colour, are the most common to dogs; and,
when existing in great numbers, particularly
in puppies and young ones, sometimes prove
fatal by the convulsions they occasion. In
distemper they greatly aggravate the symptoms;
so much so, that to destroy them frequently
cures the dog. The natural situation
of these worms is within the intestines, but
they sometimes crawl from them into the stomach,
and are then brought up by the sickness
they occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>ascarides</i>, or small thread-worms,
likewise occasionally infest dogs, residing principally
within the rectum. They produce an
intolerable itching behind, to relieve which
those troubled with them are seen continually
drawing the fundament along the ground.
Except by the irritation occasioned, which
may weaken when it is excessive, they do not
appear to do much internal injury. The constitution
of some dogs appears particularly
favourable to the generation of worms; for,
destroy them as often as you will, they soon
return again. Puppies, during every stage
of their growth, are very liable to them;
in many, the increase of the body appears
checked by their ravages.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>presence of worms</i>, when they exist
in considerable numbers, is easily detected;
for such a dog has usually a slight cough, his
coat stares, he eats voraciously, yet seldom
fattens: his evacuations prove also a most
unequivocal symptom, for they are, in such
cases, peculiarly irregular, being at one time
loose and slimy, and at another more hard and
dry than natural. The belly likewise is often
tense and enlarged. When very young dogs
have worms, the first that pass are seldom noticed,
for they seem to affect the health but
little; but gradually, as they increase, purging
becomes more frequent; and the animal,
though lively, becomes emaciated; his appetite
is often irregular, his nose hot and dry,
and his breath fœtid. The growth likewise
appears stationary, and in this way it is very
common for him to continue till a fit or two
carries him off, or he dies tabid. In adult
dogs worms are less fatal, though, from the
obstructions they form, they sometimes kill
them likewise; and they always occasion a
rough unhealthy coat, with a hot nose and fœtid
breath; and in both the young and the
full grown, they occasionally produce epileptic
fits. It does not follow, because no worms are
seen to pass away, that one who exhibits the
other symptoms of them has none; neither,
when they are not seen, does it follow even
that none pass; for, if they remain long in the
intestines after they are dead, they become
digested like other animal matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>treatment</i> of worm cases in dogs has
been like that of the human, and the remedies
employed have been intended either to destroy
the worms within the body, or otherwise to
drive them mechanically, as it were, out of
the bowels by active purgatives; but, as these
latter means were violent (for, without the
very mucus of the bowels, as well as the fæces,
were expelled, no benefit was derived from
them), so the remedy, in many instances, became
worse than the disease. Many substances
have, therefore, been tried in hopes of
destroying these animals within the body; and
it is evident that any thing that could certainly
do this would be most important, as it would
obviate the necessity of having recourse to the
violent purgative means heretofore employed.</p>

<p class='c006'>For this purpose, substances which present
small spiculi, or points, have been found the
best adapted for the destruction of worms, by
abrading their external or internal surfaces,
and that without in the slightest degree injuring
the patient. Among huntsmen and
gamekeepers glass, very finely powdered, is a
very favourite remedy. An old man of this
description, in Buckinghamshire, was famed
for worm-killing in dogs, and his only means
used was glass finely powdered, and given as
a ball. Mr. Youatt also recommends the
same. If this should be objected to, from
what I believe to be a groundless fear, that it
is dangerous, try the following:—</p>

<p class='c006'>Form into four, six, or eight balls, and give
one every morning; after which, a mercurial
purgative will be proper. I have occasionally
succeeded, in very obstinate worm cases, by
moderate daily doses of Epsom salts. Ascarides
are best destroyed by soap or aloetic
clysters. The tape-worm is not unfrequently
removed by mercurial purges; but a still more
certain remedy for this noxious guest is such
doses of the oil of turpentine as a dog could
safely take, remembering that dogs bear very
little of it: to some, however, it proves much
less hurtful than to others. A small dog
might be tried with half a drachm, given
night and morning, mixed with the yolk of an
egg, for a few days: a larger two scruples, and
the largest a drachm, beginning always with a
very small dose, and increasing it, if it produce
no disturbance.—<i>Daniel</i>—<i>The Horse</i>—<i>White</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Wounds, bruises, and other injuries, may
happen in various ways, by kicks, by bites, in
leaping over hedges or gates, by kicking against
stalls, and many other ways. Various names
have been applied to such injuries, according
to the manner in which they are inflicted; but
there is no occasion for such distinctions: they
are all bruises or contused wounds, and all
require to be poulticed or fomented. It is to
be observed, that, in all injuries of this kind,
whether wounds or bruises, or both, the horse
should be immediately bled freely, and have
his bowels opened by a dose of physic. The
diet also should be attended to, allowing only
a very moderate quantity at first of grass, or
bran mashes. In all those cases poultices are
by far the best remedy, until the inflammation
is completely subdued; and when the situation
of the part will not admit of a poultice,
which is seldom the case, then fomentations of
warm water only, almost constantly applied,
are the best substitute. When inflammation
has quite ceased, which may be known by an
abatement of the pain and swelling, and by
the appearance of white matter, the poultice
may be discontinued, and then the wound
should be carefully dressed to the bottom with
a tent of tow, dipped in melted digestive ointment.
The cavity is not to be filled with the
tent, but it must be introduced to the bottom,
and then the wound will heal as it ought;
whereas, if it is dressed superficially, or only
syringed, it will often close over at the surface,
and the wound appear healed, while the matter
is spreading and doing mischief at the
bottom. There are four obstacles to the
complete healing of wounds which sometimes
occur, and these are, when the wound has
been complicated with an injury of a bone, a
ligament, a cartilage, or a tendon. In either
of these cases the fleshy parts and skin will
generally heal readily, and the wound will
appear nearly or quite healed, except a small
or minute orifice, from which a little matter
oozes; and this orifice is not perceptible, being
covered with spongy flesh, until a probe is
introduced; it will then be found that there
is a sinus running down to the bottom of the
original wound, and there the probe will be
resisted by the diseased bone, ligament, cartilage,
or tendon. The bone may be easily distinguished
by the sensation conveyed to the
hand through the probe; and when this is felt
a free opening should be made, if the situation
of the wound will admit of it, and the diseased
surface scraped off. A tent of friar’s
balsam should then be introduced, and continued
until it is cured. If the first scraping
has not been freely performed, a second may
be necessary. Sometimes sinuses, or pipes,
as they are termed, remain after the inflammation
of wounds has subsided. If these are
superficial, running under the surface, or
nearly horizontally, they require to be laid
open, and then they heal readily. Sometimes
they run obliquely inward, or perpendicularly,
and then require to be dressed at first with
stimulating or even caustic tents, of solution
of blue vitriol; and these must be repeated
until the sides of the sinus have sloughed off,
and the very bottom of the wound can be distinctly
felt. In all complicated ulcers of this
kind, where the sinus runs in a winding or
crooked direction, or where there are two or
more sinuses, the caustic tents must be repeated
until they are brought to the state of
one simple sore, the bottom of which can be
distinctly felt; and if the bottom happen to be
bone, it must be scraped freely and dressed
with friar’s balsam. A good method of destroying
such sinuses is to take some corrosive
sublimate, or finely pulverised blue vitriol,
and fold it up in a long narrow slip of thin
whity-brown paper; this being neatly folded
may be twisted at each end, and may thus be
conveniently introduced into the sinuses, and
forced to the very bottom with a long probe.
Several small particles of this kind may be
made and forced in one after another, until
all the sinuses are completely filled. By
these means a large core or slough will be
brought out in four or five days; and if the
sinuses are not then so destroyed that the
bottom can be ascertained, the same dressing
must be repeated.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a class of punctured wounds that
will not admit of the treatment I have described;
these are punctured wounds of the
sheath of tendons, and the capsular ligament
of joints. Such wounds often happen about
the fetlock and hock joint, or in the sheath of
the flexor tendon, or back sinew; and these
are often attended with considerable inflammation
and swelling. It will not be proper
to introduce tents into such wounds, or to
irritate them by probing: emollient poultices
are considered the remedies for such wounds;
but they do not always succeed; I have in
several cases found it necessary to touch the
wound with lunar caustic, before I could procure
any abatement of the inflammation and
swelling, and I am inclined to believe that
this had better be done on the first occurrence
of such wounds. The caustic should be
scraped off to a point, and introduced within
the wound about the eighth of an inch or a
little more; it should then be moved round a
little, and withdrawn. I have seen a punctured
wound in the fore leg, near the fetlock joint,
get well rapidly after this had been done;
though emollient poultices and fomentations
had been carefully employed for several days
before without doing the least good; on the
contrary they were doing harm, for the inflammation,
pain, and swelling, certainly increased
while they were employed. But the caustic
seemed to operate almost as a charm; for the
leg got well in two or three days after it was
applied. I have seen a similar good effect
from it in a punctured wound of the hock
joint.</p>

<p class='c006'>In lacerated wounds, as they are termed,
the skin is often much torn, and so are the
muscles or flesh. Now the muscles must
never be stitched up, on any account whatever;
the skin only is to be stitched or sewed
up, and that will rarely be of any use in the
horse, as union by the first intension, I believe
I may venture to say, can never be accomplished
in the horse, except in one situation,
and that is in the forehead, when the skin has
been torn neatly down or up and not bruised.
When the skin of a lacerated wound has been
stitched up, the stitches always give way, and
the wound is completely open again by the
fifth day, and then the flap of skin may as
well be removed, for it never will unite.
The scar will then be much less than a person
would imagine, for the skin and hair will
be in a great measure regenerated, and scarcely
any blemish will be left.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bruises always require to be poulticed, and
there is scarcely any situation where this cannot
be done, if a person will but take a little
trouble about it. If, however, it cannot be
done, a fomentation is the best substitute.
For bruises on the back the old farriers employed
a greasy dish-clout, and this, next to a
poultice, is perhaps the best remedy; for the
cloth has been so softened by almost constant
maceration in water, and is so completely imbued
with grease, that it really becomes a
good emollient application, and only requires
to be kept wet. By this treatment bruises
will be generally brought to suppuration, and
if they are capable of being dispersed, poultices
are the best means of effecting it. When
a bruise has been brought to suppuration, or
has thrown off a slough, it may then be considered
as a wound or rather ulcer, for such
wounds do become when they have suppurated,
and must be treated according to the
directions I have given under that head.
These are all the instructions necessary to be
given for the treatment of wounds and bruises.
I think there is no occasion here for the classification
and distinctions that are employed in
human surgery; and it will be found, I trust,
that what has been said on the subject, will
be sufficient for every accident that may happen.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>When a horse becomes suddenly lame, after
the legs have been carefully examined and no
cause of lameness appears in them, the shoe
should be taken off. In many cases the offending
substance will be immediately detected,
or the additional heat felt in some part of the
foot will point out the seat of injury; or, if
the crust be rapped with the hammer all
round, the flinching of the horse will discover
it; or pressure with the pincers will render it
evident.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the shoe is removed for this examination
the smith should never be permitted
to wrench it off, but each nail should be
drawn separately, and examined as it is drawn,
when some moisture appearing upon it will
not unfrequently reveal the spot at which
matter has been thrown out. In the fore-foot
the injury will generally be found on the inner
quarter, and on the hind foot near the
toe, these being the thinnest parts of the fore
and hind-feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sudden lameness occurring within two or
three days after the horse has been shod will
lead us to suspect that the smith has been in
fault; yet no one who considers the thinness
of the crust, and the difficulty of shoeing
many feet, will blame him for sometimes
pricking the horse. His fault will consist in
concealing or denying that of which he will
almost always be aware at the time of shoeing,
from the flinching of the horse, or the
dead sound, or the peculiar resistance that
may be noticed in the driving of the nail.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the seat of mischief is ascertained,
the sole should be thinned round it, and,
especially at the nail-hole or the puncture, it
should be pared to the quick. The escape of
some matter will now probably tell the nature
of the injury, and remove its consequences.
If it be puncture of the sole by some nail, or
any similar body, picked up on the road, all
that will be necessary is a little to enlarge the
opening, and then to place on it a pledget of
tow dipped in friar’s balsam, and over that a
little common stopping; or, if there be much
heat and lameness, a poultice should be
applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>The part of the sole wounded and the
depth of the wound will be taken into consideration.
It will be seen that a deep puncture
towards the back part of the sole, and
penetrating even into the sensible frog, may
not be productive of serious consequence.
There is no great motion in the part, and
there are no tendons or bones in danger. A
puncture near the toe may not be followed by
much injury. There is little motion in that
part of the foot, and the internal sole covering
the coffin-bone will soon heal; but a puncture
about the centre of the sole may wound the
flexor tendon where it is inserted into the
coffin-bone, or may even penetrate the joint
which unites the navicular bone with the coffin-bone,
or pierce through the tendon into the
joint which it forms with the navicular-bone,
and a degree of inflammation may ensue,
which, if neglected, may be fatal. Many
horses have been lost by the smallest puncture
of the sole in these dangerous points.
All the anatomical skill of the veterinarian
should be called into requisition, when he is
examining the most trifling wound of the
foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the foot has been wounded by the wrong
direction of a nail in shoeing, and the sole be
well pared out over the part on the first appearance
of lameness, little more will be
necessary to be done. The opening must be
somewhat enlarged, the friar’s balsam applied,
and the shoe tacked on, with or without
a poultice, according to the degree of lameness
or heat, and on the following day all will
often be well. It may, however, be prudent
to keep the foot stopped for a few days. If the
accident has been neglected, and matter begins
to be formed, and to be pent up and to press
on the neighbouring parts, and the horse evidently
suffers extreme pain, and is sometimes
scarcely able to put his foot to the ground,
and much matter is poured out when the
opening is enlarged, further precautions must
be adopted. The fact must be recollected
that the living and dead horn will never unite,
and every portion of the horny sole that has
separated from the fleshy sole above must be
removed. The separation must be followed
as far as it reaches. Much of the success of
the treatment depends on this. No small
strip or edge of separated horn must be suffered
to press upon any part of the wound.
The exposed fleshy sole must then be touched,
but not too severely, with the butyr (chloride)
of antimony, some soft and dry tow placed
over the part, and the foot stopped, and a
poultice placed over all, if the inflammation
seems to require it. On the following day a
thin pellicle of horn will frequently be found
over a part or the whole of the wound. This
should be, yet very lightly, touched again
with the caustic; but if there be an appearance
of fungus sprouting from the exposed
surface, the application of the butyr must be
more severe, and the tow again placed over it,
so as to afford considerable yet uniform pressure.
Many days do not often elapse before
the new horn covers the whole of the wound.
In these extensive openings the friar’s balsam
will not often be successful, but the cure
must be effected by the judicious and never
too severe use of the caustic. Bleeding at
the toe and physic will be resorted to as useful
auxiliaries when much inflammation arises.</p>

<p class='c006'>In searching the foot to ascertain the existence
of prick, there is often something very
censurable in the carelessness with which the
horn is cut away between the bottom of the
crust and the sole, so as to leave little or no
hold for the nails, while some months must
elapse before the horn will grow down sufficiently
far for the shoe to be securely fastened.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a free opening has been made below,
and matter has not broken out at the coronet,
it will rarely be necessary to remove any portion
of the horn at the quarters, although we
may be able to ascertain by the use of the
probe that the separation of the crust extends
for a considerable space above the sole.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>Dogs are liable to become wounded in
various ways, and their wounds, however bad,
are not, generally much attended to, from an
opinion that the animal’s tongue is the best
dressing. This is very questionable: in some
instances, I am certain, no application can be
worse to a wounded dog than his own tongue.
Whenever dogs are at all inclined to foulness,
as a tendency to cuticular complaints is called,
a sore, so licked, is sure to become mangy,
and to be aggravated by the licking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wounds in the chest or belly should be
closed up as soon as possible, to prevent the
external air from penetrating: a stitch or two
made in the integuments is proper; over
which some adhesive plaster, and a bandage
over that, may be applied. If the intestines
protrude in a wounded belly, and the bowels
are themselves wounded; first, neatly stitch
up the intestinal opening, and return the gut;
then close the wound in the integuments,
leaving the thread which united the gut, if
long enough, hanging without the external
wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>In wounds of arteries or veins, the hæmorrhage
should be stopped by pressure: should
that not succeed, take up the vessel with
needle and thread. Wounds into joints occur
from cuts, and often from stabs: great inflammation
is apt to follow, and the dog is often
lamed for life. If the synovia escapes by a
very minute puncture, and the inflammation
is not yet very extensive, treat exactly as in
horse practice, by firing with the budding iron.
If the wound be a lacerated one, and not
already much inflamed, place over it a pledget
of lint, and over that a thick paste of linseed
meal; after which bandage the whole up
moderately tight. Should the inflammation
be great, reduce that by a common poultice,
and then endeavour to close the joint as
above.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all extensive and lacerated wounds, a
stitch or two should be made with a large
needle and thread, as it will reduce both the
sore and the scar; but as such stitches soon
ulcerate out in the dog, so the edges should be
still further secured by slips of sticking-plaster.
A recent wound should be cleansed from
the dirt, and then covered up; when it begins
to suppurate, dress with any mild ointment.
In thorn wounds, or others made with splinters,
carefully examine that nothing is left
within them; otherwise no attempts to produce
healing will prove successful. The most
common wounds in dogs arise from the bites
of others; and, under any such circumstance,
should any suspicion arise that the dog was
mad by which the wounded one was bitten,
proceed as directed under Rabies. The
wounds arising from common bites, in general
soon heal of themselves. If, however, they
are very extensive, wash them with friar’s
balsam, to prevent their becoming gangrenous.</p>

<p>LORD YARBOROUGH’S YACHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Royal Yacht Club, at the present
time, has about five hundred and eighty-eight
persons on its lists, of which one hundred and
thirty-six are members, and four hundred and
fifty-two are honorary members. Of the former
number about one fifth are peers, twelve
baronets, four knights, three generals, three
colonels, eight captains, two clergymen, and
seventy-nine private gentlemen. Among the
latter (honorary members) we find nineteen
admirals, twenty-nine vice-admirals, thirty-one
rear-admirals, and three hundred and
sixty-two captains, independently of eleven
eminent civilians, who head the list. The
number of yachts is one hundred and nine—of
which eighty-seven are cutters, ten schooners,
three brigs, four yawls, two ships, two
ketches, and one lugger. The greater part of
these vessels belong to Cowes and to Southampton,
the rest being distributed among
the different ports of the three kingdoms.
The shipping belonging to the club amounts
to 7250 tons. Now, at a moderate computation,
each vessel carries ten men on an average;
this gives us the total number employed
by the club, one thousand and sixty. During
the summer months, then, while regattas are
celebrated, we may say that the Royal Yacht
Club alone supports more than eleven hundred
men. These, with some few exceptions,
are discharged on the approach of winter, and
the yachts are laid up for the season, retaining
the master and one man in pay. The
crews thus discharged obtain employment in
merchant vessels or otherwise during the winter,
and in the middle of spring are generally
re-shipped in the yachts in which they have
previously served. Active and industrious
men of good character are always sure of constant
employment in the club on these conditions;
and many members justly pride themselves
on the high discipline, manly bearing,
and crack appearance of their crew. The
situation of master is one of much responsibility,
and is on all accounts respectably filled.
In some of the largest craft, junior officers of
the navy are found to accept this office. The
Flower of Yarrow, the property of the Duke
of Buccleuch, is commanded by one of the
oldest lieutenants in the service, to say nothing
of others, respecting which we cannot enter
into particulars.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been already remarked, that the
shipping of the club amounts to 7250 tons.
Now, a vessel of one hundred tons seldom,
we believe, stands the owner in less than from
five to six thousand pounds, varying, of course,
from that to ten, according to the ornamental
parts, the internal fittings, and other contingencies.
At this rate, the shipping of the
club would have cost more than three millions
and a half of money: but it is impossible to
speak decisively on this point; for the first
cost of the yachts vary so much, and the
numerous styles of <i>rig</i> are attended with
expenses so widely different, that it is idle to
attempt a conclusive opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the most active members of this
club we may mention the following—but we
make the selection from past remembrances,
and not from any invidious distinction. Lord
Yarborough is well known to the world as the
commodore, and his beautiful ship, the Falcon,
is admired no less for her model than the fine
seamanship of her “companie.” Mr. Weld,
of Lulworth, and his brother James, have
been indefatigable in their exertions; and who
has not heard of the Arrow, the Lulworth,
and the Alarm, of the former, and the Paul
Pry of the latter? Lord Belfast too, Lord
Anglesea, Lord Darnley, Lord Vernon, the
Rev. Denis George, Lord Clonbrook, Mr.
Symonds, Lord Errol, Mr. Corbett, Lord
Donegal, Lord Chesterfield, Mr. Brett, Lord
Ilchester, Mr. Gibson, the Duke of Buccleuch,
and many others whom we have not room to
mention, are known to take a high personal
interest in aquatics. Mr. Assheton Smith, a
name so familiar at Melton Mowbray, seemed
to love his yacht as much as he did the chace;
and who is ignorant of the nautical achievements
of Sir Godfrey Webster? Nor can I
omit to mention the arduous attention, the
unremitting exertions (to say nothing of his
generous disposition), of a gentleman to whom
the Yacht Club is deeply indebted for his
assistance—Richard Stephens, Esq. the secretary.
His indefatigable zeal and valuable aid
on all occasions, and at all seasons, is beyond
any praise.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Northern Yacht Club is a highly interesting
society, although its plan is not so
extensive as that of the Royal Club. It contains
about three hundred and fifty members.
The documents for 1830, with which the
commodore, J. E. Matthews, Esq. has favoured
us, comprise ninety-two in the Scottish and
ninety in the Irish division, with fifty-two
honorary members, in addition to ninety-three
members of the Cork Yacht Club, who are
also entered on the honorary lists. It had,
in 1830, sixty yachts, not equal in proportion
to the tonnage of the Cowes club, as smaller
vessels are admitted. Many R. Y. C. men
are found in the Northern Club; among
others, the Marquis of Donegal, Earl Belfast,
the Duke of Portland, the Rev. Denis George,
and Captain Kean. The commodore of the
Irish division is John E. Matthews, Esq. who
hoists his flag in the Water Witch, a three-masted
schooner of seventy-three tons; and
the Duke of Portland, in his Clown, ketch,
one hundred and fifty-six, still, we believe,
presides over the Scottish division. There are
many fine vessels in this club. Cutters, as
usual, excel in number, but there are many
<i>clippers</i> in the shape of schooners; and what
is more in a “ladye’s eye,” their names are
equally pretty and well chosen.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have now to notice the Cork Harbour
Club, one of highest descent, independently of
its regatta being considered the oldest in the
United Kingdom. We are deficient in particulars
respecting this association; but we
know that it is supported by some of the first
men in Ireland, and has many handsome
yachts in its fleet. The Emerald Isle is highly
favoured by having two powerful clubs, equally
respected and respectable; and it is pleasing
to see the honourable men of the north
blending the names of Scotland and Ireland
under the bright emblem of friendship.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must not omit to mention the share
Dublin takes in these festivals, nor pass by
in silence Plymouth, with her excellent
Regatta Club and Yacht Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the lowest computation, the number of
vessels at present employed for pleasure in
this kingdom cannot be less than from three
to four hundred, ranging in bulk from ten to
three hundred and fifty tons. These craft are
variously distributed along our shores, carrying
their opulence into every port and harbour
in the sister islands. But there is another
advantage arising from yacht clubs, which as
yet has been slightly touched upon; I mean,
that national principle which to a maritime
people is above all choice. The bulwarks of
England are her wooden walls; and if our
ships are hearts of oak, let it not be forgotten
that “hearts of oak are our men” also; and
we must never allow the proud feeling of
naval supremacy to wither or decay. The
yacht clubs, by keeping alive this feeling, feed
the flame of patriotism, and uphold, with just
ambition, our hopes, our honour, and our fame.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>To dye fine rich bright Yellows.</i>—These
are the best yellows for salmon colours, as
they are very strong. The gold colours, as
before directed, are better for some flies. You
are to get two pounds of strawall, and six
ounces of turmeric: boil these in eight
quarts of water; put down one pound of fur
along with your dye stuff; give it an hour’s
boiling, and you have a fine shade: boil on
an hour longer and draw again: boil for an
hour and a half, and draw again. Finish
your last with two hours’ boiling, and you
have four as fine high yellows as can be dyed,
and fast colours.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mr. Peter Woulfe’s Recipe for the
Yellow Dye.</i>—Take half an ounce of powdered
indigo, and mix it in a high glass vessel,
with two ounces of strong spirit of nitre,
which should be previously diluted with eight
ounces of water, for preventing the indigo
being set on fire by the spirit; because two
ounces and a half of strong spirit of nitre will
set fire to half an ounce of indigo. Let the
mixture stand for a week, and then digest it
in a sand heat for an hour or more, and add
four ounces more of water to it; filter the solution,
which will be of a fine yellow colour.
If the indigo be digested twenty-four hours
after the spirit of nitre is poured upon it, it
will froth and boil over, but after standing
about a week it has not that property. One
part of the solution of indigo in the acid of
nitre, mixed with four or five parts of the
water, will dye silk cloth of the palest yellow
colour, or of any shade to the deepest, and
that by letting them boil more or less in the
colour. The addition of alum is useful, as it
makes the colour more lasting; according as
the solution boils away, more water must be
added—cochineal, Dutch litmus, orchil, cudbear,
and many other colouring substances,
treated in this manner, will dye silk and wool
a yellow colour. The indigo which remains
undissolved in making Saxon blue, and collected
by filtration, if digested with spirit of
nitre, dyes silk and wool of all shades of
brown inclining to yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Boyle tells us a most beautiful yellow
may be procured, by taking good quicksilver,
and three or four times its weight of oil of
vitriol. Drawing off in a glass retort the
saline menstruum from the metalline liquor,
till there remains a dry snow-white calx at the
bottom. On pouring a large quantity of fair
water on this, the colour changes to an excellent
light yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lighter Yellows.</i>—Take three or four
sprigs of eld, and two chips of young fustic,
about the size of half a crown; boil them in
six quarts of water for two hours; put down
all your stuff together. You may then put
in half a thimbleful of the best madder, and
the same of turmeric; let them boil smartly
for five minutes, and then draw a part for
the first shade. It must be divided into four
parts; let it boil ten minutes; lift out and
draw; follow on by adding a whole thimbleful
of each for the second, and one and a half
thimbleful for the third, and two of each for
the last. This is the only bright yellow I
could get to stand, and is the best for foxes.
You may dye hog’s fur in this if it be very
white.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Another Recipe.</i>—Take two large handfuls
of laurel leaves, nice and green, the same
with ivy tops, and half a pound of weld. Put
your weld in the bottom, and some of laurel
branches to cover the weld, and lay your
mohair nice and thin over the laurel; then
cover with the ivy, and put the remainder of
the laurel on the top; put on your wooden
frame and your lid, and fill the pot with
water, and boil it as long as you please, and
you will get fine rich soft yellows. Do not
boil too long at first, or omit to draw soon, as
you will lose your nice golden colours, and
others, for the drake’s. This will not dye
hog’s fur, but is a fast colour.—<i>Ancient
Recipes.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Yellowhammer</span>, <i>s.</i> A bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weight of this species is about seven
drachms; length six inches; bill dusky bluish;
irides hazel; the crown of the head, throat,
and belly, are of a beautiful bright yellow;
the back part and sides of the head tinged
with green; the breast, in some, is marked
with reddish-brown; quill-feathers dusky, the
primores edged on their exterior webs with
greenish-yellow, the secondaries with rusty-brown,
those next the body, the greater coverts,
and back, dusky, deeply margined with
the same, the latter dashed with green; the
rump and upper tail-coverts tawny-red; the
tail a little forked, dusky, edged with greenish-yellow;
the two outer feathers marked with
white on the exterior webs; legs yellow-brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The female has much less yellow about the
head, and the colours in general less vivid.
The yellow hammer is subject to some variety
in plumage. We have a specimen in
which the whole head and neck is of a light
yellow; some of the quill-feathers and scapulars
white; and the under parts and rump
pale yellow. The young birds have no yellow
about them when first they leave the nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is one of the most common indigenous
birds of this country; if it were more rare,
its beauty would be less disregarded. Its song,
however, is as little attractive as that of the
common bunting, possessing only a repetition
of the same note five or six times successively,
terminating in one more lengthened
and shrill. In winter they assemble in flocks,
with other granivorous birds, and pick up the
scattered grain dispersed by the bountiful flail,
and not by the master of the hoarded sheaves,
who knows too well the value of his auriferous
store. It does not breed till late in the
spring. The nest is generally placed near the
ground, in some low bush or hedge. It is
composed of straw and various dried stalks,
and lined with fine dried grass, finished with
long hair.—<i>Montagu.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Yellows</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease in horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>This disorder takes its name from the yellowness
of the eyes and mouth; the urine is
high-coloured; dung small and slimy: pulse
quick and sometimes very <i>weak</i>. The horse
appears exceedingly weak and languid; sometimes
in such a degree that he reels when led
out of the stable; he eats but little, yet is
generally rather thirsty. This disease generally
requires in the first place copious bleeding,
being evidently of an inflammatory nature;
this is denoted by the membranes of
the eye appearing red instead of yellow, and
by the pulse being rather <i>strong</i> as well as
quick, and sometimes by the breathing being
a little quickened. I have seen, however, the
membranes of the eye exceedingly red, while
the pulse was so feeble as to forbid bleeding;
most commonly, however, it is otherwise;
and, as a general practice, it is safer to bleed
freely at first. Sometimes it is necessary to
repeat the bleeding; this is generally the case
when we are prevented, by the apparent debility
of the animal, from bleeding copiously
at first. When the heart and the brain are
oppressed with blood there is always great stupor
and debility, and generally a pulse that
may lead the inexperienced to avoid bleeding;
but, upon taking off a gallon of blood, the
pulse, in such circumstances, will often feel
stronger; and, if the blood be examined after
it has become cool, it will be found rather

<p class='c006'>After the operation of these medicines the
horse is generally so far relieved that nothing
more is necessary to perfect a recovery than
an abstemious diet, consisting chiefly of bran
mashes, with a small quantity of the sweetest
and best hay. When the debility is considerable
a little gruel may be given; and if the
purgative effect of the medicine continue
longer than one day, it should be restrained by
giving a little gruel made of wheat flour or
arrow root. This disorder happens most frequently
about September or October, especially
after a hot season. The various degrees
in which we meet with it depends chiefly, I
believe, upon its being noticed sometimes
earlier than at others. At first the symptoms
are alarming; the horse appears languid and
sluggish, and feeds badly; the eyes look rather
dull, and upon opening the lids with the
finger and thumb the yellowness before described
may be observed; the inside of the
lips and gums will be found also tinged with
yellow. In this stage an opening ball and an
abstemious diet would be sufficient generally
to effect a cure; but if it be neglected in this
stage, and if the horse is kept at work, and
especially if he is ridden fast, or urged to any
considerable exertion, the heart and lungs
will be so oppressed with blood that medical
skill will often be found unavailing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Protracted cases of distemper are sometimes
accompanied by a pustular eruption, which
extends over the surface of the chest and
belly, and peels off in scales: but this integumental
determination seldom affords any relief,
and such cases almost invariably terminates
fatally. This state is also sometimes
accompanied with an hepatic affection of a
very fatal character, which has been called
among sportsmen the yellow disease, from its
tinging every part of the surface of the body
with a yellow hue: the urine also is of a deep
yellow, the consequence of some morbid
translation of the inflammation to the secreting
vessels of the liver. Mr. Youatt has
found this state most frequent in the hound
and greyhound; he also has observed it particularly
where there is little catarrhal exudation
from the nose, which I believe is the
case, although I have also seen it accompanied
by a profuse discharge.—<i>White</i>—<i>Blaine.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>While mention is making of the bad effects
of yew-berries, it may be proper to remind the
unwary, that the twigs and leaves of yew,
though eaten in a very small quantity, are
certain death to horses and cows, and that in
a few minutes. A horse tied to a yew hedge,
or to a faggot stack of dead yew, shall be found
dead before the owner can be aware that any
danger is at hand: and the writer has been
several times a sorrowful witness to losses of
this kind among his friends: and in the
island of Ely had once the mortification to
see nine young steers or bullocks of his own
lying dead in a heap, from browzing a little on
a hedge of yew in an old garden into which
they had broken in snowy weather. Even
the clippings of a yew hedge have destroyed
a whole dairy of cows, when thrown inadvertently
into a yard. And yet sheep and turkeys,
and, as park-keepers say, deer, will crop
these trees with impunity.—<i>White’s Antiquities

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Young</span>, <i>a.</i> Being in the first part of life, not old; ignorant, weak; it is
sometimes applied to vegetable life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Young horses, however, seldom derive that
benefit from cordials and ale that older horses
do, and particularly those which are accustomed
to such treatment. The most effectual
and the most innocent restorative is rest; for
which in summer a field is the best situation:
but if, during the time of rest, the horse be
kept in a stable, his diet must be carefully
attended to. This should be rather opening,
and such as the horse appears to relish;
vetches, or other green food, are perhaps the
best. Good sweet bran is an excellent thing to
keep the bowels cool and open, and may be
rendered nutritious in almost any degree by
the addition of good fresh bruised oats or malt.
A small quantity of good sweet and clean
oats thrown into the manger now and then
will often induce a horse to feed when there
is want of appetite; and a very small quantity
of the sweetest hay, given occasionally, is
generally eaten with great relish.</p>

<p class='c006'>Young horses often fall off in their appetites
during the time of cutting teeth. At
this period there is often a soreness of the
mouth, in which the mucous membrane of
the stomach and bowels seems to participate.
In such cases the want of appetite is generally
attributed to the lampas, or a swelling or fulness
in the roof of the mouth, adjoining the
front teeth; because the horse is sometimes
observed to mangle his hay, as it is termed;
that is, he pulls it out of the rack, and after
chewing it a little while, throws it out again.
The common remedy, if such it may be called,
is the application of a red-hot iron to the part,
and burning out the prominent part or lampas;
but this is never necessary. All young
horses have that fulness in the roof of the
mouth which is named lampas; and it never
interferes with their appetite or the chewing or
gathering of their food; there may, however,
be some degree of tenderness about the gums
at the time of teething, when soft food, such
as bran mashes, should be given for a few
days; and as the stomach and bowels are
sometimes affected also, a little nitre may be
given in the mashes, and an emollient clyster
thrown up. When there is costiveness, or
slimy dung, a laxative drench may be given
also, composed of 4 oz. Epsom salt; 2 drachms
of carbonate of soda; 1 pint of warm water;
and 4 oz. of castor oil.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the mouth appears very tender or sore,
it may be washed or syringed with a lotion,
composed of alum, honey, and water. Keeping
a horse on new oats or new hay is often
followed by some derangement of the stomach
and bowels, indicated by looseness and want
of appetite, and sometimes by excessive staling
also, with considerable thirst and a staring
coat. A change of diet is in such cases the
most essential thing; but it is often necessary
also to give some tonic medicine, or a warm
laxative, such as three or four drachms of
aloes, three drachms of soap, and a drachm
or two of ginger, with a few drops of oil of
caraway. Horses sometimes fall off in appetite
merely from loading their bowels, or from
staying in the stable idle too long. In this
case an abstemious diet, principally of bran
mashes or grass, and a clyster, are necessary,
and if that fail a mild dose of physic should
be given.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Zoological Description of the Horse.</i>—The
horse belongs to the <i>division vertebrated</i>,
because he has a cranium or skull, and a spine
or range of vertebræ proceeding from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vertebrated animals, however, are very
numerous. They include man, quadrupeds of
all kinds, birds, fishes, and many reptiles.
We look out then for some subdivision, and a
very simple line of distinction is soon presented.
Some of these vertebrated animals
have <i>mammæ</i>, or teats, with which the females
suckle their young. The human female
has two, the mare two, the cow four, the bitch
ten or twelve, and the sow more than twelve.</p>

<p class='c006'>This <i>class</i> of vertebrated animals, having
mammæ or teats, is called <i>mammalia</i>, and the
horse belongs to the division <i>vertebrata</i>, and
the class <i>mammalia</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The class mammalia is still exceedingly
large, and we must again subdivide it. It is
stated (Library of Entertaining Knowledge,
vol. i. p. 13) that “this class of quadrupeds,
or mammiferous quadrupeds, admits of a division
into two <i>Tribes</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“1. Those whose extremities are divided
into fingers or toes, scientifically called <i>unguiculata</i>,
from the Latin word for <i>nail</i>; and 2,
Those whose extremities are hoofed, scientifically
called <i>ungulata</i>, from the Latin word
for <i>hoof</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The extremities of the first are armed
with claws or nails, which enable them to
grasp, to climb, or to burrow. The extremities
of the second tribe are employed merely to
support and move the body.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The extremities of the horse are covered
with a hoof, by which the body is supported,
and with which he cannot grasp any thing, and
therefore he belongs to the tribe ungulata, or
hoofed.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is a great variety of hoofed animals.
The elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus,
the swine, the horse, the sheep,
the deer, and many others, are ungulated or
hoofed; they admit, however, of an easy division.
Some of them masticate, or chew
their food, and it is immediately received into
the stomach and digested; but in others, the
food, previous to digestion, undergoes a very
singular process. It is returned to the mouth
to be re-masticated, or chewed again. These
are called ruminantia, or ruminants, from the
food being returned, from one of the stomachs
(for they have four) called the rumen or
paunch, to be chewed again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ungulata that do not ruminate are
somewhat improperly called pachydermata,
from the thickness of their skins. The horse
does not ruminate, and therefore belongs to
the order pachydermata.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pachydermata who have only one toe,
belong to the family solipeda—single-footed.
Therefore the horse ranks under the division
vertebrata; the class mammalia—the tribe
ungulata—the order pachydermata—and the
family solipeda.—<i>The Horse.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'><span class='xlarge'>C</span>oach-horse</span>, <i>s.</i> A horse used for coaches.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal has fully shared in the progress
of improvement, and is as different from
what he was fifty years ago as it is possible
to conceive. The clumsy-barrelled, cloddy-shouldered,
round-legged, black family horse,
neither a coach nor a dray-horse, but something
between both, as fat as an ox, and, with
all his pride and prancing at first starting, not
equal to more than six miles an hour, and
knocking-up with one hard day’s work, is no
more seen; and we have, instead of him, an
animal as tall, deep-chested, rising in the
withers, slanting in the shoulders, flat in the
legs, with even more strength, and with treble
the speed.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a great deal of deception, however,
even in the best of these improved
coach-horses. They prance it nobly through
the streets; and they have more work in
them than the old clumsy, sluggish breed;
but they have not the endurance that could
be wished; and a pair of poor post-horses
would, at the end of the second day, beat
them hollow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The knee-action, and high lifting of the
feet, in the carriage-horse is deemed an excellence,
because it adds to the grandeur of his
appearance; but, as has already been stated,
it is necessarily accompanied by much wear
and tear of the legs and feet, and this is very
soon apparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principal points in the coach-horse are
substance well placed, a deep and well-proportioned
body, bone under the knee, and
sound, open, tough feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The origin of the better kind of coach-horse
is the Cleveland-bay, confined principally
to Yorkshire and Durham, with, perhaps,
Lincolnshire on one side, and Northumberland
on the other, but difficult to meet
with pure in either county. The Cleveland
mare is crossed by a three-fourth, or thoroughbred
horse of sufficient substance and height,
and the produce is the coach-horse most in
repute, with his arched crest and high action.
From the thorough-bred of sufficient height,
but not of so much substance, we obtain the
four-in-hand, and superior curricle-horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>From less height and more substance, we
have the hunter and better sort of hackney;
and, from the half-bred, we derive the machiner,
the poster, and the common carriage-horse;
indeed, Cleveland, and the Vale of
Pickering, in the East Riding of Yorkshire,
may be considered as the most decided breeding
country in England for coach-horses,
hunters, and hackneys. The coach-horse is
nothing more than a tall, strong, over-sized
hunter. The hackney has many of the qualities
of the hunter on a small scale.</p>

<p class='c006'>How far we are carrying supposed improvement
too far, and sacrificing strength and usefulness
to speed, is a question not difficult to
resolve. The rage for rapid travelling is the
bane of the post-master, the destruction of
the horse, and a disgrace to the English character.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no truth so easily proved, or so
painfully felt by the post-master, at least in
his pocket, as that it is the pace that kills. A
horse at a dead pull, or at the beginning of
his pull, is enabled, by the force of his muscles,
to throw a certain weight into the collar.
If he walk four miles in the hour, some part
of that muscular energy must be expended in
the act of walking; and, consequently, the
power of drawing must be proportionally diminished.
If he trot eight miles in the hour,
more animal power is expended in the trot,
and less remains for the draught; but the
draught continues the same, and, to enable
him to accomplish his work, he must tax his
energies to a degree that is cruel in itself, and
that must speedily wear him out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let it be supposed—what every horse cannot
accomplish—that he shall be able, by
fair exertion and without distress, to throw, at
a dead pull, a weight into his collar, or exert
a force equal to two hundred and sixteen
pounds; or, in other words, let him be able
to draw a load which requires a force of two
hundred and sixteen pounds to move. Let
him next walk at the rate of four miles in an
hour; what force will he then be able to employ?
We have taken away some to assist
him in walking, and we have left him only
ninety-six pounds, being not half of that which
he could exert when he began his pull. He
shall quicken his pace to six miles an hour—more
energy must be exerted to carry him
over this additional ground. How much has
he remaining to apply to the weight behind
him? Fifty-four pounds only. We will
make the six miles an hour ten; for it seems
now to be the fashion for the fast coach, and
for almost every coach, and every vehicle to
attempt this pace. How stands the account
with the poor beast? We have left him a
power equal to thirty-two pounds only to be
employed for the purpose of draught.</p>

<p class='c006'>The load which a horse can draw is about
fifteen times greater than the power exerted,
supposing the road to be hard and level, and
the carriage to run with little friction; and
the horse, which at starting, can throw into
the collar a weight or force equal to two hundred
and sixteen pounds, will draw a load of
three thousand two hundred. Let him, however,
be urged on at the rate of ten miles in
the hour—deduct the power used in swiftness
of pace from the sum total of that which he
possesses, and what remains? not a sixth
part—not that which is equal to a quarter of
a ton—or, if it be a stage-coach, the energy
exerted in draught by the four horses will not
be equal to a ton.</p>

<p class='c006'>The coach, and its passengers and its luggage,
weigh more than this, and the whole is
still drawn on, and must be so. Whence
comes the power? From the over-strained
exertion, the injury, the torture, the destruction
of the horse. That which is true of the
coach-horse, is equally true of every other.
Let each reader apply it to his own animal,
and act as humanity and interest dictate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many a horse used on our public roads is
unable to throw all his natural power or weight
into the collar. He is tender-footed—lame;
but he is bought at little price, and he is worked
on the brutal and abominable principle, that
he may be “whipped sound.” And so apparently
he is. At first he sadly halts; but,
urged by the torture of the lash, he acquires
a peculiar habit of going. The faulty limb
appears to keep pace with the others, but no
stress or labour is thrown upon it, and he
gradually contrives to make the sound limbs
perform among them all the duties of the
unsound one; and thus he is barbarously
“whipped sound,” and cruelty is undeservedly
rewarded. After all, however, what has
been done? Three legs are made to do that
which was almost too hard a task for four.
Then they must be most injuriously strained,
and soon worn out, and the general power of
the animal must be rapidly exhausted, and,
at no great distance of time, exhaustion and
death release him from his merciless persecutors.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that between Glasgow and Edinburgh,
a carrier in a single horse-cart, weighing
about seven hundred weight, will take a
load of a ton, and at the rate of twenty-two
miles in a day. The Normandy carriers travel
with a team of four horses, and from fourteen
to twenty-two miles in a day, with a
load of ninety hundred weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>An unparalleled instance of the power of a
horse when assisted by art, was shown near
Croydon. The Surrey iron rail-way being
completed, a wager was laid by two gentlemen,
that a common horse could draw thirty-six
tons for six miles along the road, and that he
should draw his weight from a dead pull, as
well as turn it round the occasional windings
of the road. A numerous party of gentlemen
assembled near Merstham to see this
extraordinary triumph of art. Twelve wagons
loaded with stones, each wagon weighing above
three tons, were chained together, and a horse,
taken promiscuously from the timber cart of
Mr. Harwood, was yoked to the train. He
started from the Fox public-house, near
Merstham, and drew the immense chain of
wagons, with apparent ease, almost to the
turnpike at Croydon, a distance of six miles,
in one hour and forty-one minutes, which is
nearly at the rate of four miles an hour. In
the course of the journey he stopped four
times, to show that it was not by any advantage
of descent that this power was acquired;
and after each stoppage he again drew off the
chain of wagons with great ease. Mr. Banks,
who had wagered on the power of the horse,
then desired that four more loaded wagons
should be added to the cavalcade, with which
the same horse set off again with undiminished
pace. Still further to show the effect
of the rail-way in facilitating motion, he directed
the attending workmen, to the number
of fifty, to mount on the wagons, and the
horse proceeded without the least distress;
and, in truth, there appeared to be scarcely
any limitation to the power of his draught.
After this trial the wagons were taken to the
weighing-machine, and it appeared that the
whole weight was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Ferret</span>, <i>s.</i> A small animal of prey.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ferret has a longer and thinner body,
a narrower head, and a sharper snout than
the polecat. It has not the same sagacity in
providing its subsistence, and unless taken
care of and nourished in the house, it cannot
even exist, at least in our climates, for those
which have been lost in the burrows of rabbits
have never multiplied, but most probably
perished by the severity of the winter. The
ferret also, like other domesticated animals,
varies in colour, and is as common in hot
countries as the polecat is scarce. The female
is conspicuously smaller than the male; and
when in season, Gesner says, she has even
been known to die if her desires were not
gratified. They are reared in casks or chests,
where it is usual to furnish them with beds of
flax. They sleep most perpetually, but no
sooner are they awake than they eagerly seek
for food, which consists of bran, bread, milk,
&amp;c. The females bring forth twice a year,
and go six weeks with their young. Some
of them eat their young almost as soon as
they are brought forth, are immediately in
season again, and then have three litters in
the year, each of which consists of from five
to nine.</p>

<p class='c006'>This animal is by nature a mortal enemy
to the rabbit. If even a dead one is presented
to a young ferret, although he have
never seen a rabbit before, he flies at and
tears it with fury: but if it be alive, he seizes
it by the nose or throat, and sucks its blood.
When let into the burrows of rabbits, it is
necessary to muzzle him, that he may not
kill them in their holes, but only oblige them
to run out, that they may be entrapped in
the nets; besides, if he is suffered to go in
unmuzzled, there is great danger of his being
lost; for having sucked the blood of the rabbit,
he will fall asleep; and smoking the hole
is not always a successful expedient to bring
him back, because as the burrows frequently
communicate with each other, he is apt to be
the more bewildered the more he is surrounded
with smoke. The ferret is also made use of

<p class='c006'>Strabo says, the ferret was brought from
Africa into Spain; which does not appear void
of foundation, as Spain is the native climate
of rabbits, and the country where formerly
these animals most abounded. It is probable,
therefore, that the rabbits having increased so
much as to become incommodious, the ferret
was introduced to diminish them, instead of
encouraging the race of polecats, from which
no advantage could have accrued but the
death of the rabbit, whereas by the ferret
some benefit is obtained by the hunter. The
ferret, though easily tamed and rendered
docile, is exceedingly irascible; he has always
an ill smell, but more so when heated or irritated.
He has lively but inflamed eyes; all
his movements are quick, and is besides so
strong, that he will easily master a rabbit
three or four times as big as himself.—<i>Buffon.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fish, Gold and Silver</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>When I happen to visit a family where gold
and silver fishes are kept in a glass bowl, I am
always pleased with the occurrence, because
it offers me an opportunity of observing the
actions and propensities of those beings with
whom we can be little acquainted in their
natural state. Not long since I spent a fortnight
at the house of a friend where there was
such a vivary, to which I paid no small attention,
taking every occasion to remark what
passed within its narrow limits. It was here
that I first observed the manner in which
fishes die. As soon as the creature sickens,
the head sinks lower and lower, and it stands
as it were on its head; till, getting weaker,
and losing all poise, the tail turns over, and
at last it floats on the surface of the water
with its belly uppermost. The reason why
fishes, when dead, swim in that manner is
very obvious; because, when the body is no
longer balanced by the fins of the belly, the
broad muscular back preponderates by its own
gravity, and turns the belly uppermost, as
lighter from its being a cavity, and because it
contains the swimming-bladders, which contribute
to render it buoyant. Some that delight
in gold and silver fishes have adopted a notion
that they need no aliment. True it is that
they will subsist for a long time without any
apparent food but what they can collect from
pure water frequently changed; yet they
must draw some support from animalcula,
and other nourishment supplied by the water;
because, though they seem to eat nothing,
yet the consequences of eating often drop from
them. That they are best pleased with such
jejune diet may easily be confuted, since if
you toss them crumbs, they will seize them
with great readiness, not to say greediness:
however, bread should be given sparingly, lest,
turning sour, it corrupt the water. They will
also feed on the water-plant called duck’s
meat (<i>Lemna</i>), and also on small fry.</p>

<p class='c006'>When they want to move a little they
gently protrude themselves with their <i>pinnæ
pectorales</i>; but it is with their strong muscular
tails only that they and all fishes shoot
along with such inconceivable rapidity. It
has been said that the eyes of fishes are immoveable:
but these apparently turn them
forward or backward in their sockets as their
occasions require. They take little notice of
a lighted candle, though applied close to their
heads, but flounce and seem much frightened
by a sudden stroke of the hand against the
support whereon the bowl is hung; especially
when they have been motionless, and are perhaps
asleep. As fishes have no eyelids, it is
not easy to discern when they are sleeping
or not, because their eyes are always open.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing can be more amusing than a glass
bowl containing such fishes: the double refractions
of the glass and water represent
them, when moving, in a shifting and changeable
variety of dimensions, shades, and colours,
while the two mediums, assisted by the concavo-convex
shape of the vessel, magnify and
distort them vastly; not to mention that the
introduction of another element and its inhabitants
into our parlours engages the fancy in
a very agreeable manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gold and silver fishes, though originally
natives of China and Japan, yet are become
so well reconciled to our climate as to thrive
and multiply very fast in our ponds and stews.

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Quitter</span>, <i>s.</i> A disease in horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a disease of the foot, originating
in a bruise or tread upon the coronet, or thin
parts of the hoof. Superficial injuries on the
coronet are often inflicted by the horse scratching
himself with the opposite heel. But the
bruise which causes quitter is of a more
serious nature, and is inflicted by the horse
stepping with great force upon the higher part
of the inside of the foot, in endeavouring to
save himself from slipping; and from this it
is that the disorder generally or almost always
takes place in winter, when the roads are
slippery. It is well known that smiths, and
the most ignorant of farriers, often succeed in
their treatment of this disorder, and that
veterinary surgeons often fail. The cause is,
that they are not sufficiently attentive to such
cases, and do not follow up the dressing as it
is necessary to do, in order to get at the bottom
of the injury. In order to cure a quitter
effectually, let the following directions be
carefully attended to.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ascertain carefully, by means of a probe,
the direction and extent of the sinuses, or
pipes, as they are termed, then let them be
completely filled with sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>To do this effectually, the sublimate must
be wrapped up in small pieces of whitey-brown
paper, and introduced by very small
portions at a time, so that they may be forced,
as near as possible, to the bottom of the sinus.
But however carefully this may be done, the
sinuses are always so crooked or winding, that
the first dressing can seldom be got to the
bottom of them. In six or seven days a large
slough or core will come out, when the dressing
has been properly applied; and as soon as
this has taken place, it may be necessary to
dress in the same manner as at first; and even
this must be repeated if the bottom of the
disease is not found, and that generally is the
lateral cartilage. Nothing more is necessary
after this than to keep the sinus filled with
lint, dipped in friar’s balsam, taking care to
introduce it quite to the bottom every time of
dressing. The sinus will thus be gradually
filled up and healed. Quitters are sometimes
cured by syringing the part, after it has been
cored out, with sublimate. For this purpose
a tube is forced into the wound, so as to reach
the bottom, and through it a strong solution
of blue vitriol, or tincture of myrrh, is injected.
When these means fail, the foul cartilage,
or bone, may be scraped by a very
small chisel or gouge, or other more convenient
instrument. I have seen quitters cured, or
rather dried up, merely by dressing with tincture
of myrrh, after coring it out with sublimate.
The opening has often remained, and
appeared to have become horny within, so that
no inconvenience was felt from it. Another
method of curing quitter is one commonly
practised by farriers or shoeing smiths, and is
called boring. This is done by pasting a red-hot
iron, of a suitable size and form, to the
bottom of the sinus, and then filling it with
sublimate, or strong sublimate ointment.
Sometimes another opening is made through
the sound parts, at a little distance from the
quitter, but in a slanting direction, so as to
communicate with the quitter: this also is
filled with sublimate ointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>When much pain and swelling take place
after the operation, the foot may be wrapped
in a large poultice. After the cure of a bad
quitter there is often a permanent defect on
that side of the hoof, which is named a false
quarter; that is, the new shoot of horn that
grows down is imperfect, depressed, of a light
colour, and is apt to split, and become a sand
crack. When a horse receives a wound or
bruise on the foot or coronet, by treading
upon it, or by other means, the most likely
method of preventing a quitter is to bathe the
wound or bruise with a strong stimulant, such
as tincture of myrrh, friar’s balsam, spirit of
turpentine, or camphorated spirit. This seems
to deaden the sensibility of the bruised or
wounded nerves, and thereby prevent inflammation
more effectually than a poultice.
Should inflammation take place, however,
afterwards, a poultice should be applied.—<i>White.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>After the usual parading, the whole drew
up together, and made a false start—Ludlow,
Physician, and Carlton staying behind, and all
the others going some distance before they
could be pulled up. On re-assembling, a
most excellent and beautiful start was effected,
the lot going away in a cluster, with
Mr. Powlett’s filly leading for about two
hundred yards, when Roué took it from her—Carlton,
the filly, Physician, Nitocris, Birdcatcher,
Richmond, Trustee, Maria, Retainer,
Julius, and Fang following alongside in front,
and the others well up, at one of the worst
Leger paces ever witnessed, and all keeping
their ground over the hill to the T. Y. C.
post, when Mr. Pavis began to handle the
whipcord to Daxon, who was the first that
exhibited defeat. The example, however, was
soon found to have plenty of imitators; for,
before reaching the Red House, Fang, Nitocris,
Trustee, Carlton, Roué, and Brother to
Maria, fell away from the contest—Mr. Powlett’s
mare coming round the corner down to
the rails with a very promising and flattering
appearance, followed closely by Birdcatcher,
Physician, Retainer, and Richmond; Margrave
lying two or three lengths in the rear.
On reaching the rails Calloway came out with
Birdcatcher, went up to the Figaro filly, at
the distance defeated her, and looked very
much like a winner; but Robinson, who had
patiently waited, now crept up on the outside,
making his ground by a gradual steady advance.
At the stand he caught the Birdcatcher,
and left him at the post in the rear
by three-quarters of a length, amid the deafening
shouts of the lads “wot had put the
siller on the back of Muley’s son.” The
Figaro filly ran in third, Physician (only beat
by the filly a head) fourth, Richmond fifth,
Retainer sixth, and David seventh—Ludlow,
Fang, Byzantium, and Carlton landing the
four <i>last</i> horses of the race.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Safety Trigger</span>, <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Safety-triggers have been introduced to
obviate, if possible, the fatal accidents which
have arisen from accidental discharges. Many
plans have been devised to effect this most
desirable object. Among the most ingenious,
one by Goulding, and another by Moore, are
among the most novel, and probably the
most effective. People must, however, be
miserably nervous, to render safety-triggers
necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Stable</span>, <i>s.</i> A place for horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Loftiness is very desirable in a stable. It
should never be less than twelve feet high,
and the best method of ventilation is by
means of a chimney or square opening in the
ceiling, communicating with the open air, or
it may be made in the form of a dome or
cupola, which would be more ornamental.
The chimney need not be opened at the top
so as to admit the rain, but should be roofed,
and have lateral openings by means of weather-boards,
as they are termed. As to the
admission of air into the stable, the usual
means provided for that purpose are quite
sufficient; that is, by windows. The method
adopted in barrack stables, of making an opening
in the wall, near the ground at the end of
the stable, is useless, to say the best of it.
A stable, when properly paved, and kept
moderately clean, requires only a shallow,
wide gutter, twelve inches wide, and one inch
deep. This, with a pail or two of water
thrown upon the floor, and swept off while
the horse is at exercise, will keep the
stable perfectly clean and free from offensive
smells. The depth of a stable should not be
less than eighteen feet, nor the height, as I
observed before, less than twelve. The width
of a stall should not be less than six feet
clear. But, when there is sufficient room, it
is a much better plan to allow each horse a
space of ten or twelve feet, where he may be
loose and exercise himself a little. This will
be an effectual means of avoiding swollen
heels, and a great relief to horses that are
worked hard. With respect to the rack and
manger, I shall describe one which I have
seen employed in a wagon-stable with the
best effect. It is intended for two horses;
for horses, when a little accustomed to each
other, and working together, will always agree
well when kept in the same stall, especially
when they have, as is the case here, separate
mangers, and are prevented by their halters
from interfering with each other’s corn. The
space for two horses is twelve feet. The
mangers and rack are all on a level, and
about three feet from the ground. The
manger should never be less than eighteen
inches deep, eighteen inches from the front to
the back part, and two feet in length. The
rack should be four feet for one horse. The
rack may be made with staves in the front,
like a common rack, but this is not necessary;
indeed, it is better to have it closed in front.
The back part of the rack should be an inclined
plane made of wood; should be gradually
sloped towards the front; and should
terminate about two feet down. Such a rack
will hold more hay than ever ought to be put
before one horse. The advantages of this
rack are numerous. In the first place the
hay is easily put into it, and renders a hayloft
over the stable unnecessary; and this
may be an inducement to the builder to make
the stable as lofty as it ought to be, and render
other ventilation unnecessary. All the
hay that is put into this manger will be eaten;
but in the common rack it is well known that
a large portion of the hay is often pulled down
upon the litter and trodden upon, whereby a
considerable quantity is often wasted. It
prevents the hayseeds or dust from falling
upon the horse, or into his eyes; and, what is
of considerable importance, though seldom
attended to, there will be an inducement to
the groom to give the horse hay in small
quantities at a time, and frequently, from the
little trouble which attends putting it into
the rack. The saving in hay that may be
effected by the use of this rack is so apparent
that it need not be dwelt upon. Some mischievous
horses will throw out the hay with
their noses: but this may be effectually prevented
by one or two cross bars—that is,
crossing the upper part of the crib from the
back to the front. This kind of rack and
manger, from being boarded up in front, will
effectually prevent the litter from being kept
constantly under the horse’s head and eyes,
by which he is compelled to breathe the vapours
which arise from it. The length of the
halter should be only four feet from the
headstall to the ring through which it passes:
this will admit of his lying down with ease,
and that is all which is required. The ring
should be placed close to that side where the
manger is, and not in the centre of the stall.
The sides of the stall should be sufficiently
high and deep, to prevent horses from biting
and kicking each other. In post and wagon
stables, where the stall is made for a
pair of horses, the manger will be placed
at each end, and the hay-crib in the centre.
The window of the stable should be
at the south-east end, and the door at the
opposite end. The window should be as
high as the ceiling will admit of, and in size
proportioned to that of the stable. In one of
twelve feet high, it need not come down more
than five feet, and will then be seven feet
from the ground, and out of the way of being
broken. The frame of the window should
be moveable upon a pivot in the centre, and
opened by means of a cord running over a
pulley in the ceiling, and fastened by means
of another cord. With a window of this kind,
in a stable of three or four horses, no other
ventilation will be required: a person never
need be solicitous about finding openings for
the air to enter when there is sufficient room
above, and means for it to escape. It is a
good plan to have two doors, or to have the
common door divided transversely, about four
or five feet from the ground; the upper part
may then be occasionally left open. Where
much light is admitted, the walls of the stable
should not be white, but of a stucco or
lead colour, and better if painted; for then
they may always be washed clean with soap
and water, as well as the stalls, rack, and
manger; and this should be done once in two
or three weeks, or a month at furthest. If
the walls are boarded up to the height of
about five feet, and this, as well as the stalls,
painted of a light wainscot colour, it will look
extremely neat, and the under part of the
wall will be kept drier, and look more comfortable.
A stable should be lighted by means
of an argand lamp suspended from the ceiling,
and moveable. This will give a far better
light, is cheaper, and more secure than any
other contrivance whatever, except gas-light,
and, if properly trimmed, will burn without
a particle of smoke. Instead of having a
large corn chest in the stable, a handsome seat
may be made at the back of the stable extending
as far as may be necessary: in this
there may be partitions to separate the beans,
or the bran, and places may be made to rest
the arms upon, so that a gentleman may sit
down comfortably in his stable and see his
horses taken care of. A stable thus constructed
will be found conducive to the health
and the comfort of horses, and will afford an
inducement to the groom to attend to every
little circumstance which may contribute to
cleanliness. He will not allow the smallest
bit of dung to remain swept up at one end of
the stable, as it commonly is. The pails
should be kept outside, and not standing
about the stable, as they commonly are. If
it is necessary to take off the chill from water,
it is much better and more easily done, by
the addition of a little hot water, than by
suffering it to stand in the stable; and while
the horses are at exercise, the litter should be
all turned out to dry, and the floor well
washed or swept out. A little fresh straw
may then be placed for the horses to stale
upon. Litter thus dried during the day will
serve again as well as fresh straw for the bottom
of the bed, and be free from smell. A
saving may be made in litter by turning it
out, and drying it as I have described; and if
a shed were built adjoining a stable, it may
be done at all times, and may serve also to
exercise and clean a horse in wet weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither dogs, fowls, nor goats, should ever
be permitted to enter a stable; and dung
should be kept at a distance from it. In
speaking of the arrangements of the stable, it
may not be amiss to notice what I consider a
good contrivance in cleaning horses, that is,
to have two straps, one on each side the stall,
about one yard from the head of it. By these
the horse may be fastened during the time
he is cleaned, by which means he will be
effectually prevented from biting the manger
or the groom; and being kept back in the stall,
the groom will be better able to clean the
front of his fore legs, chest, and neck, and be
able to move round him: this is better than
strapping him to the rack. When the common
rack and manger are preferred, the rack
staves should be straight, and brought nearly
down to the manger, and this may easily be
done without the necessity of a hay loft, and
the manger may be made deep and wide as I
have described it.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c006'>The heat of a stable should be graduated
by a thermometer, always kept there for the
purpose. Our feelings are but a feeble guide
to our judgment in measuring temperature.
It would be well that the stable heat should
seldom reach, but never exceed, 50 degrees of
Fahrenheit in winter, or 65 in summer. To
renew the air, the stable should be well ventilated;
and such ventilation should be as near
the ceiling or top of the stable as possible, as
the impure air ascends. The ventilators,
sometimes seen, which revolve quickly on
their own centres, are not, I think, good,
because they occasion a draught of air; for
which reason likewise windows should be so
constructed as not to open directly on either
the front or the rear of the horse. One of the
best methods of ventilation is by means of one
or more tubes or funnels, according to the size
of the stable, which should be let into the
ceiling, presenting below a larger end of twelve
or eighteen inches square, which, as it ascends,
should narrow at its summit to about four or
five inches; and this should pass out at the
roof of the building, having a raised cup over
its top to prevent the wet from descending.
Light appears essentially necessary to a stable;
the exit from a dark one must be a painful
stimulus to the eyes of the horse, and his
imperfect vision makes him startlish and irritable.
Dark stables are supposed to encourage
feeding; and it is not impossible but the
horses of eastern countries eat most during the
night. It also, it is thought, induces them to
lie down more. The greatest encouragement
to the latter is a loose box, and to the former
air, exercise, and soft water. Stables should
be well ceiled, and that very closely: when
this is not the case, not only does the dust
from the hayloft fall on the horse, but it frequently
enters his eyes; and the impure air,
composed of nitrogen and ammoniacal gas,
which always ascends, lodges in the hay above.
In fact, it would be better that both the hay
and corn should be altogether removed from
the sphere of action of the ammoniacal effluvia
of the stable, and only brought to the animals
as they are wanted. Partial draughts of air
in a stable should be carefully avoided, as
extremely injurious to horses: a very lofty
ceiling without an upper story, is the best preventive
to this. Narrow stalls are very prejudicial
to horses; strains in the back are often
occasioned by them; and whenever a stall is
less than six feet wide, the groom should have
peremptory orders never to turn the horse out
of it, but always to back. Bars or bails are
also objectionable, from the ease with which
horses may play with and kick each other
over them, and likewise because it is seldom
that horses eat alike in point of quickness;
and thus, when they are separated by bars
only, the slowest eater gets robbed of his food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The acclivity of the generality of stalls is
also a very serious objection to them, for
they occasion a horse to stand unequally, and
an undue proportion of weight is thrown on
the hinder extremities: the declivity also puts
the flexor tendons of both the hind and fore
legs on a continual stretch, and by it probably
many horses are injured. The smallest possible
slope only should be allowed: neither
is the central grating a remedy for this inconvenience;
for it not only is useless as regards
mares, but it is rather injurious, because it
retains the urine, which thus continues to diffuse
at every moment the effluvia it should
be so much our study to avoid. It is much
better that each stall should be furnished with
a grating placed over a small drain at the foot
of the stall, which should be so constructed,
as to carry off the urine or washings from
each horse into one common out-door cesspool
perfectly secured against the access of
the external air, that an injurious effluvia may
not pass up through the gratings. Professor
Peal, in his excellent <i>Observations</i>, has
entered largely into the injurious effects of
the ammoniacal exhalations arising from the
urine: to these he attributes, in a great measure,
the ophthalmia by which so many valuable
horses are ruined. This separation of
volatile alkali is not confined to the urinary
secretion alone—it extends to the fæces also,
and to both the sensible, and to the insensible
perspiration. The urine, from the experiments
of that able chemist, Dr. Egan, begins
to separate ammonia in a few hours after its
evacuation from the body, and there is reason
to suppose that the fæces as readily fall into
this early decomposition; therefore a necessity
exists for their speedy removal also.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is much contrariety of opinion relative
to the propriety of permitting horses to
stand during the day on litter; and there are
cogent arguments for and against it. Litter
entices horses to lie down during the day,
which relieves fatigue, and is favourable to
the recovery of over-strained limbs: it also
prevents an uneven or hurtful pressure on the
feet when it is cobble-paved. On the other
hand, gross feeding horses are apt to eat their
litter, which is not desirable. It is, likewise,
too apt to retain the urine, and thereby to
generate the acrid salts we have described.
Constantly standing on straw makes many
horses’ legs swell, which is proved by removing
it, when such legs immediately return to
their proper size: the warmth and moisture
retained in it, likewise, are very apt to occasion
cracks and swelled legs. Litter retained
is probably injurious to the feet also; for if
horn has a tendency to contract by the application
of heat, the horn of the feet being
placed so many hours within it, must be subjected
to this additional stimulus to contraction.
In my own stables no litter is ever
suffered to remain under the fore feet during
the day: on the contrary, the horses stand on
the bare bricks, which in summer are watered
to make them more cool. Behind, a little
straw is strewed, because horses are apt to
kick and break the bricks with their hinder
feet, and because, when no gratings exist, or
no slope is present, the litter thus placed
sucks up the moisture of the urine, which
would be detrimental to the hinder feet,
which are more liable to thrushes than contraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The box is a necessary appendage to every
good stable; indeed, it may, with great propriety,
form a part of the stable: and I would
advise that, whenever a new one be erected, so
to frame it, that every standing may, by a
moveable partition, be readily made into a
distinct and separate box. It would be well,
were in-door horses more generally accustomed
to spend their leisure time in boxes
than stalls: boxes are advantageous to the
jaded horse, by encouraging him to lie down
during the day; they are advantageous to the
idle horse, by encouraging him to exercise
himself. By means of boxes, the evils of long
frosts to the hunter are avoided; and the
unrestrained enjoyment of freedom is relished
by all. A loose box wholly unconnected with
the stable is also a valuable appendage to a
gentleman’s establishment: it may thus with
impunity be the receptacle of a contagious
case. The detached box should be so constructed
as to be capable of being cooled to
nearly the temperature of the external air, or,
when necessary, to be made as warm as requisite
for some cases of sickness. No projections
should be allowed in its walls to hurt
the hips, in cases of falling from weakness,
staggers, &amp;c. It should, also, have a grate in
the centre communicating with an outer cesspool,
with a general slight bearing of the flooring
to the grating: into a large box of this
description, every horse taken up from grass
should be first put, to prevent the access of the
worst colds to which horses are liable, which
are those caught on the sudden remove from
a cool into a heated temperature.—<i>White</i>—<i>Blaine’s

Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
